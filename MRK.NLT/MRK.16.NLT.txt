41:16:001:0    Saturday evening , when the Sabbath ended , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome went out and purchased burial spices so they could anoint Jesus ’ body . 
41:16:002:0    Very early on Sunday morning , just at sunrise , they went to the tomb . 
41:16:003:0    On the way they were asking each other , “ Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb ? ” 
41:16:004:0    But as they arrived , they looked up and saw that the stone , which was very large , had already been rolled aside . 
41:16:005:0    When they entered the tomb , they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side . The women were shocked , 
41:16:006:0    but the angel said , “ Don ’ t be alarmed . You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He isn ’ t here ! He is risen from the dead ! Look , this is where they laid his body . 
41:16:007:0    Now go and tell his disciples , including Peter , that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee . You will see him there , just as he told you before he died . ” 
41:16:008:0    The women fled from the tomb , trembling and bewildered , and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened. -- -- -- -- -- [ ] [ ] Then they briefly reported all this to Peter and his companions . Afterward Jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life . Amen . [ ] 
41:16:009:0    After Jesus rose from the dead early on Sunday morning , the first person who saw him was Mary Magdalene , the woman from whom he had cast out seven demons . 
41:16:010:0    She went to the disciples , who were grieving and weeping , and told them what had happened . 
41:16:011:0    But when she told them that Jesus was alive and she had seen him , they didn ’ t believe her . 
41:16:012:0    Afterward he appeared in a different form to two of his followers who were walking from Jerusalem into the country . 
41:16:013:0    They rushed back to tell the others , but no one believed them . 
41:16:014:0    Still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together . He rebuked them for their stubborn unbelief because they refused to believe those who had seen him after he had been raised from the dead . 
41:16:015:0    And then he told them , “ Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone . 
41:16:016:0    Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved . But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned . 
41:16:017:0    These miraculous signs will accompany those who believe : They will cast out demons in my name , and they will speak in new languages . 
41:16:018:0    They will be able to handle snakes with safety , and if they drink anything poisonous , it won ’ t hurt them . They will be able to place their hands on the sick , and they will be healed . ” 
41:16:019:0    When the Lord Jesus had finished talking with them , he was taken up into heaven and sat down in the place of honor at God ’ s right hand . 
41:16:020:0    And the disciples went everywhere and preached , and the Lord worked through them , confirming what they said by many miraculous signs .
