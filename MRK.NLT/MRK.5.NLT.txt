41:5:001:0    So they arrived at the other side of the lake , in the region of the Gerasenes . 
41:5:002:0    When Jesus climbed out of the boat , a man possessed by an evil spirit came out from the tombs to meet him . 
41:5:003:0    This man lived in the burial caves and could no longer be restrained , even with a chain . 
41:5:004:0    Whenever he was put into chains and shackles—as he often was—he snapped the chains from his wrists and smashed the shackles . No one was strong enough to subdue him . 
41:5:005:0    Day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills , howling and cutting himself with sharp stones . 
41:5:006:0    When Jesus was still some distance away , the man saw him , ran to meet him , and bowed low before him . 
41:5:007:0    With a shriek , he screamed , “ Why are you interfering with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? In the name of God , I beg you , don ’ t torture me ! ” 
41:5:008:0    For Jesus had already said to the spirit , “ Come out of the man , you evil spirit . ” 
41:5:009:0    Then Jesus demanded , “ What is your name ? ” And he replied , “ My name is Legion , because there are many of us inside this man . ” 
41:5:010:0    Then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place . 
41:5:011:0    There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby . 
41:5:012:0    “ Send us into those pigs , ” the spirits begged . “ Let us enter them . ” 
41:5:013:0    So Jesus gave them permission . The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs , and the entire herd of about 2,000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water . 
41:5:014:0    The herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside , spreading the news as they ran . People rushed out to see what had happened . 
41:5:015:0    A crowd soon gathered around Jesus , and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons . He was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane , and they were all afraid . 
41:5:016:0    Then those who had seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs . 
41:5:017:0    And the crowd began pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone . 
41:5:018:0    As Jesus was getting into the boat , the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him . 
41:5:019:0    But Jesus said , “ No , go home to your family , and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been . ” 
41:5:020:0    So the man started off to visit the Ten Towns of that region and began to proclaim the great things Jesus had done for him ; and everyone was amazed at what he told them . 
41:5:021:0    Jesus got into the boat again and went back to the other side of the lake , where a large crowd gathered around him on the shore . 
41:5:022:0    Then a leader of the local synagogue , whose name was Jairus , arrived . When he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet , 
41:5:023:0    pleading fervently with him . “ My little daughter is dying , ” he said . “ Please come and lay your hands on her ; heal her so she can live . ” 
41:5:024:0    Jesus went with him , and all the people followed , crowding around him . 
41:5:025:0    A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding . 
41:5:026:0    She had suffered a great deal from many doctors , and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them , but she had gotten no better . In fact , she had gotten worse . 
41:5:027:0    She had heard about Jesus , so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe . 
41:5:028:0    For she thought to herself , “ If I can just touch his robe , I will be healed . ” 
41:5:029:0    Immediately the bleeding stopped , and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition . 
41:5:030:0    Jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him , so he turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my robe ? ” 
41:5:031:0    His disciples said to him , “ Look at this crowd pressing around you . How can you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ” 
41:5:032:0    But he kept on looking around to see who had done it . 
41:5:033:0    Then the frightened woman , trembling at the realization of what had happened to her , came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done . 
41:5:034:0    And he said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace . Your suffering is over . ” 
41:5:035:0    While he was still speaking to her , messengers arrived from the home of Jairus , the leader of the synagogue . They told him , “ Your daughter is dead . There ’ s no use troubling the Teacher now . ” 
41:5:036:0    But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Just have faith . ” 
41:5:037:0    Then Jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn ’ t let anyone go with him except Peter , James , and John ( the brother of James ) . 
41:5:038:0    When they came to the home of the synagogue leader , Jesus saw much commotion and weeping and wailing . 
41:5:039:0    He went inside and asked , “ Why all this commotion and weeping ? The child isn ’ t dead ; she ’ s only asleep . ” 
41:5:040:0    The crowd laughed at him . But he made them all leave , and he took the girl ’ s father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying . 
41:5:041:0    Holding her hand , he said to her , which means “ Little girl , get up ! ” 
41:5:042:0    And the girl , who was twelve years old , immediately stood up and walked around ! They were overwhelmed and totally amazed . 
41:5:043:0    Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened , and then he told them to give her something to eat .
