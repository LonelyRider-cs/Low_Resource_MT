41:10:001:0    Then Jesus left Capernaum and went down to the region of Judea and into the area east of the Jordan River . Once again crowds gathered around him , and as usual he was teaching them . 
41:10:002:0    Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question : “ Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife ? ” 
41:10:003:0    Jesus answered them with a question : “ What did Moses say in the law about divorce ? ” 
41:10:004:0    “ Well , he permitted it , ” they replied . “ He said a man can give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away . ” 
41:10:005:0    But Jesus responded , “ He wrote this commandment only as a concession to your hard hearts . 
41:10:006:0    But ‘ God made them male and female ’ from the beginning of creation . 
41:10:007:0    ‘ This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife , 
41:10:008:0    and the two are united into one. ’ Since they are no longer two but one , 
41:10:009:0    let no one split apart what God has joined together . ” 
41:10:010:0    Later , when he was alone with his disciples in the house , they brought up the subject again . 
41:10:011:0    He told them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery against her . 
41:10:012:0    And if a woman divorces her husband and marries someone else , she commits adultery . ” 
41:10:013:0    One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them . But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him . 
41:10:014:0    When Jesus saw what was happening , he was angry with his disciples . He said to them , “ Let the children come to me . Don ’ t stop them ! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children . 
41:10:015:0    I tell you the truth , anyone who doesn ’ t receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it . ” 
41:10:016:0    Then he took the children in his arms and placed his hands on their heads and blessed them . 
41:10:017:0    As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem , a man came running up to him , knelt down , and asked , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ” 
41:10:018:0    “ Why do you call me good ? ” Jesus asked . “ Only God is truly good . 
41:10:019:0    But to answer your question , you know the commandments : ‘ You must not murder . You must not commit adultery . You must not steal . You must not testify falsely . You must not cheat anyone . Honor your father and mother . ’ ” 
41:10:020:0    “ Teacher , ” the man replied , “ I ’ ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young . ” 
41:10:021:0    Looking at the man , Jesus felt genuine love for him . “ There is still one thing you haven ’ t done , ” he told him . “ Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me . ” 
41:10:022:0    At this the man ’ s face fell , and he went away sad , for he had many possessions . 
41:10:023:0    Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God ! ” 
41:10:024:0    This amazed them . But Jesus said again , “ Dear children , it is very hard to enter the Kingdom of God . 
41:10:025:0    In fact , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God ! ” 
41:10:026:0    The disciples were astounded . “ Then who in the world can be saved ? ” they asked . 
41:10:027:0    Jesus looked at them intently and said , “ Humanly speaking , it is impossible . But not with God . Everything is possible with God . ” 
41:10:028:0    Then Peter began to speak up . “ We ’ ve given up everything to follow you , ” he said . 
41:10:029:0    “ Yes , ” Jesus replied , “ and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property , for my sake and for the Good News , 
41:10:030:0    will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and property—along with persecution . And in the world to come that person will have eternal life . 
41:10:031:0    But many who are the greatest now will be least important then , and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then . ” 
41:10:032:0    They were now on the way up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking ahead of them . The disciples were filled with awe , and the people following behind were overwhelmed with fear . Taking the twelve disciples aside , Jesus once more began to describe everything that was about to happen to him . 
41:10:033:0    “ Listen , ” he said , “ we ’ re going up to Jerusalem , where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law . They will sentence him to die and hand him over to the Romans . 
41:10:034:0    They will mock him , spit on him , flog him with a whip , and kill him , but after three days he will rise again . ” 
41:10:035:0    Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came over and spoke to him . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ we want you to do us a favor . ” 
41:10:036:0    “ What is your request ? ” he asked . 
41:10:037:0    They replied , “ When you sit on your glorious throne , we want to sit in places of honor next to you , one on your right and the other on your left . ” 
41:10:038:0    But Jesus said to them , “ You don ’ t know what you are asking ! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink ? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism of suffering I must be baptized with ? ” 
41:10:039:0    “ Oh yes , ” they replied , “ we are able ! ” Then Jesus told them , “ You will indeed drink from my bitter cup and be baptized with my baptism of suffering . 
41:10:040:0    But I have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left . God has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen . ” 
41:10:041:0    When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked , they were indignant . 
41:10:042:0    So Jesus called them together and said , “ You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people , and officials flaunt their authority over those under them . 
41:10:043:0    But among you it will be different . Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant , 
41:10:044:0    and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else . 
41:10:045:0    For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many . ” 
41:10:046:0    Then they reached Jericho , and as Jesus and his disciples left town , a large crowd followed him . A blind beggar named Bartimaeus ( son of Timaeus ) was sitting beside the road . 
41:10:047:0    When Bartimaeus heard that Jesus of Nazareth was nearby , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ” 
41:10:048:0    “ Be quiet ! ” many of the people yelled at him.But he only shouted louder , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ” 
41:10:049:0    When Jesus heard him , he stopped and said , “ Tell him to come here. ” So they called the blind man . “ Cheer up , ” they said . “ Come on , he ’ s calling you ! ” 
41:10:050:0    Bartimaeus threw aside his coat , jumped up , and came to Jesus . 
41:10:051:0    “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” Jesus asked. “ My Rabbi , ” the blind man said , “ I want to see ! ” 
41:10:052:0    And Jesus said to him , “ Go , for your faith has healed you. ” Instantly the man could see , and he followed Jesus down the road .
