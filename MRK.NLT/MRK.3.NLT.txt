41:3:001:0    Jesus went into the synagogue again and noticed a man with a deformed hand . 
41:3:002:0    Since it was the Sabbath , Jesus ’ enemies watched him closely . If he healed the man ’ s hand , they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath . 
41:3:003:0    Jesus said to the man with the deformed hand , “ Come and stand in front of everyone . ” 
41:3:004:0    Then he turned to his critics and asked , “ Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath , or is it a day for doing evil ? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it ? ” But they wouldn ’ t answer him . 
41:3:005:0    He looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts . Then he said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” So the man held out his hand , and it was restored ! 
41:3:006:0    At once the Pharisees went away and met with the supporters of Herod to plot how to kill Jesus . 
41:3:007:0    Jesus went out to the lake with his disciples , and a large crowd followed him . They came from all over Galilee , Judea , 
41:3:008:0    Jerusalem , Idumea , from east of the Jordan River , and even from as far north as Tyre and Sidon . The news about his miracles had spread far and wide , and vast numbers of people came to see him . 
41:3:009:0    Jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him . 
41:3:010:0    He had healed many people that day , so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him . 
41:3:011:0    And whenever those possessed by evil spirits caught sight of him , the spirits would throw them to the ground in front of him shrieking , “ You are the Son of God ! ” 
41:3:012:0    But Jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was . 
41:3:013:0    Afterward Jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him . And they came to him . 
41:3:014:0    Then he appointed twelve of them and called them his apostles . They were to accompany him , and he would send them out to preach , 
41:3:015:0    giving them authority to cast out demons . 
41:3:016:0    These are the twelve he chose : Simon ( whom he named Peter ) , 
41:3:017:0    James and John ( the sons of Zebedee , but Jesus nicknamed them “ Sons of Thunder ” ) , 
41:3:018:0    Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James ( son of Alphaeus ) , Thaddaeus , Simon ( the zealot ) , 
41:3:019:0    Judas Iscariot ( who later betrayed him ) . 
41:3:020:0    One time Jesus entered a house , and the crowds began to gather again . Soon he and his disciples couldn ’ t even find time to eat . 
41:3:021:0    When his family heard what was happening , they tried to take him away . “ He ’ s out of his mind , ” they said . 
41:3:022:0    But the teachers of religious law who had arrived from Jerusalem said , “ He ’ s possessed by Satan , the prince of demons . That ’ s where he gets the power to cast out demons . ” 
41:3:023:0    Jesus called them over and responded with an illustration . “ How can Satan cast out Satan ? ” he asked . 
41:3:024:0    “ A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse . 
41:3:025:0    Similarly , a family splintered by feuding will fall apart . 
41:3:026:0    And if Satan is divided and fights against himself , how can he stand ? He would never survive . 
41:3:027:0    Let me illustrate this further . Who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods ? Only someone even stronger—someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house . 
41:3:028:0    “ I tell you the truth , all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven , 
41:3:029:0    but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . This is a sin with eternal consequences . ” 
41:3:030:0    He told them this because they were saying , “ He ’ s possessed by an evil spirit . ” 
41:3:031:0    Then Jesus ’ mother and brothers came to see him . They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them . 
41:3:032:0    There was a crowd sitting around Jesus , and someone said , “ Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you . ” 
41:3:033:0    Jesus replied , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ” 
41:3:034:0    Then he looked at those around him and said , “ Look , these are my mother and brothers . 
41:3:035:0    Anyone who does God ’ s will is my brother and sister and mother . ”
