41:7:001:0    One day some Pharisees and teachers of religious law arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus . 
41:7:002:0    They noticed that some of his disciples failed to follow the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating . 
41:7:003:0    ( The Jews , especially the Pharisees , do not eat until they have poured water over their cupped hands , as required by their ancient traditions . 
41:7:004:0    Similarly , they don ’ t eat anything from the market until they immerse their hands in water . This is but one of many traditions they have clung to—such as their ceremonial washing of cups , pitchers , and kettles . ) 
41:7:005:0    So the Pharisees and teachers of religious law asked him , “ Why don ’ t your disciples follow our age-old tradition ? They eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony . ” 
41:7:006:0    Jesus replied , “ You hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you , for he wrote , ‘ These people honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me . 
41:7:007:0    Their worship is a farce , for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God . ’ 
41:7:008:0    For you ignore God ’ s law and substitute your own tradition . ” 
41:7:009:0    Then he said , “ You skillfully sidestep God ’ s law in order to hold on to your own tradition . 
41:7:010:0    For instance , Moses gave you this law from God : ‘ Honor your father and mother , ’ and ‘ Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death . ’ 
41:7:011:0    But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents , ‘ Sorry , I can ’ t help you . For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you . ’ 
41:7:012:0    In this way , you let them disregard their needy parents . 
41:7:013:0    And so you cancel the word of God in order to hand down your own tradition . And this is only one example among many others . ” 
41:7:014:0    Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear . “ All of you listen , ” he said , “ and try to understand . 
41:7:015:0    It ’ s not what goes into your body that defiles you ; you are defiled by what comes from your heart . ” 
41:7:017:0    Then Jesus went into a house to get away from the crowd , and his disciples asked him what he meant by the parable he had just used . 
41:7:018:0    “ Don ’ t you understand either ? ” he asked . “ Can ’ t you see that the food you put into your body can not defile you ? 
41:7:019:0    Food doesn ’ t go into your heart , but only passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer. ” ( By saying this , he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in God ’ s eyes . ) 
41:7:020:0    And then he added , “ It is what comes from inside that defiles you . 
41:7:021:0    For from within , out of a person ’ s heart , come evil thoughts , sexual immorality , theft , murder , 
41:7:022:0    adultery , greed , wickedness , deceit , lustful desires , envy , slander , pride , and foolishness . 
41:7:023:0    All these vile things come from within ; they are what defile you . ” 
41:7:024:0    Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre . He didn ’ t want anyone to know which house he was staying in , but he couldn ’ t keep it a secret . 
41:7:025:0    Right away a woman who had heard about him came and fell at his feet . Her little girl was possessed by an evil spirit , 
41:7:026:0    and she begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter.Since she was a Gentile , born in Syrian Phoenicia , 
41:7:027:0    Jesus told her , “ First I should feed the children—my own family , the Jews . It isn ’ t right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs . ” 
41:7:028:0    She replied , “ That ’ s true , Lord , but even the dogs under the table are allowed to eat the scraps from the children ’ s plates . ” 
41:7:029:0    “ Good answer ! ” he said . “ Now go home , for the demon has left your daughter . ” 
41:7:030:0    And when she arrived home , she found her little girl lying quietly in bed , and the demon was gone . 
41:7:031:0    Jesus left Tyre and went up to Sidon before going back to the Sea of Galilee and the region of the Ten Towns . 
41:7:032:0    A deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him , and the people begged Jesus to lay his hands on the man to heal him . 
41:7:033:0    Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone . He put his fingers into the man ’ s ears . Then , spitting on his own fingers , he touched the man ’ s tongue . 
41:7:034:0    Looking up to heaven , he sighed and said , which means , “ Be opened ! ” 
41:7:035:0    Instantly the man could hear perfectly , and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly ! 
41:7:036:0    Jesus told the crowd not to tell anyone , but the more he told them not to , the more they spread the news . 
41:7:037:0    They were completely amazed and said again and again , “ Everything he does is wonderful . He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who can not speak . ”
