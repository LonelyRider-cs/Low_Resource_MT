41:11:001:0    As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem , they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent two of them on ahead . 
41:11:002:0    “ Go into that village over there , ” he told them . “ As soon as you enter it , you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here . 
41:11:003:0    If anyone asks , ‘ What are you doing ? ’ just say , ‘ The Lord needs it and will return it soon . ’ ” 
41:11:004:0    The two disciples left and found the colt standing in the street , tied outside the front door . 
41:11:005:0    As they were untying it , some bystanders demanded , “ What are you doing , untying that colt ? ” 
41:11:006:0    They said what Jesus had told them to say , and they were permitted to take it . 
41:11:007:0    Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it , and he sat on it . 
41:11:008:0    Many in the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him , and others spread leafy branches they had cut in the fields . 
41:11:009:0    Jesus was in the center of the procession , and the people all around him were shouting , “ Praise God ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the ! 
41:11:010:0    Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our ancestor David ! Praise God in highest heaven ! ” 
41:11:011:0    So Jesus came to Jerusalem and went into the Temple . After looking around carefully at everything , he left because it was late in the afternoon . Then he returned to Bethany with the twelve disciples . 
41:11:012:0    The next morning as they were leaving Bethany , Jesus was hungry . 
41:11:013:0    He noticed a fig tree in full leaf a little way off , so he went over to see if he could find any figs . But there were only leaves because it was too early in the season for fruit . 
41:11:014:0    Then Jesus said to the tree , “ May no one ever eat your fruit again ! ” And the disciples heard him say it . 
41:11:015:0    When they arrived back in Jerusalem , Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices . He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves , 
41:11:016:0    and he stopped everyone from using the Temple as a marketplace . 
41:11:017:0    He said to them , “ The Scriptures declare , ‘ My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations , ’ but you have turned it into a den of thieves . ” 
41:11:018:0    When the leading priests and teachers of religious law heard what Jesus had done , they began planning how to kill him . But they were afraid of him because the people were so amazed at his teaching . 
41:11:019:0    That evening Jesus and the disciples left the city . 
41:11:020:0    The next morning as they passed by the fig tree he had cursed , the disciples noticed it had withered from the roots up . 
41:11:021:0    Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree on the previous day and exclaimed , “ Look , Rabbi ! The fig tree you cursed has withered and died ! ” 
41:11:022:0    Then Jesus said to the disciples , “ Have faith in God . 
41:11:023:0    I tell you the truth , you can say to this mountain , ‘ May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ’ and it will happen . But you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart . 
41:11:024:0    I tell you , you can pray for anything , and if you believe that you ’ ve received it , it will be yours . 
41:11:025:0    But when you are praying , first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against , so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins , too . ” 
41:11:027:0    Again they entered Jerusalem . As Jesus was walking through the Temple area , the leading priests , the teachers of religious law , and the elders came up to him . 
41:11:028:0    They demanded , “ By what authority are you doing all these things ? Who gave you the right to do them ? ” 
41:11:029:0    “ I ’ ll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question , ” Jesus replied . 
41:11:030:0    “ Did John ’ s authority to baptize come from heaven , or was it merely human ? Answer me ! ” 
41:11:031:0    They talked it over among themselves . “ If we say it was from heaven , he will ask why we didn ’ t believe John . 
41:11:032:0    But do we dare say it was merely human ? ” For they were afraid of what the people would do , because everyone believed that John was a prophet . 
41:11:033:0    So they finally replied , “ We don ’ t know. ” And Jesus responded , “ Then I won ’ t tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
