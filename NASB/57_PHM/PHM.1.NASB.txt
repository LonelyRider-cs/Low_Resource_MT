57:1:001:1	Salutation
57:1:001:0	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker ,
57:1:002:0	and to Apphia our sister , and to Archippus our fellow soldier , and to the church in your house :
57:1:002:1	Philemon’s Love and Faith
57:1:003:0	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57:1:004:0	I thank my God always , making mention of you in my prayers ,
57:1:005:0	because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints ;
57:1:006:0	and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ’s sake .
57:1:007:0	For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you , brother .
57:1:008:0	Therefore , though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper ,
57:1:003:1	Plea for Onesimus , a Free Man
57:1:009:0	yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you—since I am such a person as Paul , the aged , and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—
57:1:010:0	I appeal to you for my child Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my imprisonment ,
57:1:011:0	who formerly was useless to you , but now is useful both to you and to me .
57:1:012:0	I have sent him back to you in person , that is , sending my very heart ,
57:1:013:0	whom I wished to keep with me , so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel ;
57:1:014:0	but without your consent I did not want to do anything , so that your goodness would not be , in effect , by compulsion but of your own free will .
57:1:015:0	For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while , that you would have him back forever ,
57:1:016:0	no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
57:1:017:0	If then you regard me a partner , accept him as you would me .
57:1:018:0	But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything , charge that to my account ;
57:1:019:0	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand , I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well ) .
57:1:020:0	Yes , brother , let me benefit from you in the Lord ; refresh my heart in Christ .
57:1:021:0	Having confidence in your obedience , I write to you , since I know that you will do even more than what I say .
57:1:022:0	At the same time also prepare me a lodging , for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you .
57:1:023:0	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you ,
57:1:024:0	as do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , Luke , my fellow workers .
57:1:025:0	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
