52:3:001:1	Encouragement of Timothy’s Visit
52:3:001:0	Therefore when we could endure it no longer , we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone ,
52:3:002:0	and we sent Timothy , our brother and God’s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith ,
52:3:003:0	so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions ; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this .
52:3:004:0	For indeed when we were with you , we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction ; and so it came to pass , as you know .
52:3:005:0	For this reason , when I could endure it no longer , I also sent to find out about your faith , for fear that the tempter might have tempted you , and our labor would be in vain .
52:3:006:0	But now that Timothy has come to us from you , and has brought us good news of your faith and love , and that you always think kindly of us , longing to see us just as we also long to see you ,
52:3:007:0	for this reason , brethren , in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith ;
52:3:008:0	for now we really live , if you stand firm in the Lord .
52:3:009:0	For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account ,
52:3:010:0	as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face , and may complete what is lacking in your faith ?
52:3:011:0	Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you ;
52:3:012:0	and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another , and for all people , just as we also do for you ;
52:3:013:0	so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints .
