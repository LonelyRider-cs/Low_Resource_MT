52:5:001:1	The Day of the Lord
52:5:001:0	Now as to the times and the epochs , brethren , you have no need of anything to be written to you .
52:5:002:0	For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night .
52:5:003:0	While they are saying , “ Peace and safety ! ” then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child , and they will not escape .
52:5:004:0	But you , brethren , are not in darkness , that the day would overtake you like a thief ;
52:5:005:0	for you are all sons of light and sons of day . We are not of night nor of darkness ;
52:5:006:0	so then let us not sleep as others do , but let us be alert and sober .
52:5:007:0	For those who sleep do their sleeping at night , and those who get drunk get drunk at night .
52:5:008:0	But since we are of the day , let us be sober , having put on the breastplate of faith and love , and as a helmet , the hope of salvation .
52:5:009:0	For God has not destined us for wrath , but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52:5:010:0	who died for us , so that whether we are awake or asleep , we will live together with Him .
52:5:002:1	Christian Conduct
52:5:011:0	Therefore encourage one another and build up one another , just as you also are doing .
52:5:012:0	But we request of you , brethren , that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you , and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction ,
52:5:013:0	and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work . Live in peace with one another .
52:5:014:0	We urge you , brethren , admonish the unruly , encourage the fainthearted , help the weak , be patient with everyone .
52:5:015:0	See that no one repays another with evil for evil , but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people .
52:5:016:0	Rejoice always ;
52:5:017:0	pray without ceasing ;
52:5:018:0	in everything give thanks ; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus .
52:5:019:0	Do not quench the Spirit ;
52:5:020:0	do not despise prophetic utterances .
52:5:021:0	But examine everything carefully ; hold fast to that which is good ;
52:5:022:0	abstain from every form of evil .
52:5:023:0	Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely ; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete , without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52:5:024:0	Faithful is He who calls you , and He also will bring it to pass .
52:5:025:0	Brethren , pray for us .
52:5:026:0	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss .
52:5:027:0	I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren .
52:5:028:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
