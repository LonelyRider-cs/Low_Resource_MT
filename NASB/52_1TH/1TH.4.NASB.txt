52:4:001:1	Sanctification and Love
52:4:001:0	Finally then , brethren , we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received from us instruction as to how you ought to walk and please God ( just as you actually do walk ) , that you excel still more .
52:4:002:0	For you know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52:4:003:0	For this is the will of God , your sanctification ; that is , that you abstain from sexual immorality ;
52:4:004:0	that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
52:4:005:0	not in lustful passion , like the Gentiles who do not know God ;
52:4:006:0	and that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things , just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you .
52:4:007:0	For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity , but in sanctification .
52:4:008:0	So , he who rejects this is not rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you .
52:4:009:0	Now as to the love of the brethren , you have no need for anyone to write to you , for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ;
52:4:010:0	for indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , to excel still more ,
52:4:011:0	and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands , just as we commanded you ,
52:4:002:1	Those Who Died in Christ
52:4:012:0	so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need .
52:4:013:0	But we do not want you to be uninformed , brethren , about those who are asleep , so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope .
52:4:014:0	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus .
52:4:015:0	For this we say to you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord , will not precede those who have fallen asleep .
52:4:016:0	For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God , and the dead in Christ will rise first .
52:4:017:0	Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air , and so we shall always be with the Lord .
52:4:018:0	Therefore comfort one another with these words .
