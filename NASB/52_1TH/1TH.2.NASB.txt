52:2:001:1	Paul’s Ministry
52:2:001:0	For you yourselves know , brethren , that our coming to you was not in vain ,
52:2:002:0	but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi , as you know , we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition .
52:2:003:0	For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit ;
52:2:004:0	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel , so we speak , not as pleasing men , but God who examines our hearts .
52:2:005:0	For we never came with flattering speech , as you know , nor with a pretext for greed—God is witness—
52:2:006:0	nor did we seek glory from men , either from you or from others , even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority .
52:2:007:0	But we proved to be gentle among you , as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children .
52:2:008:0	Having so fond an affection for you , we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives , because you had become very dear to us .
52:2:009:0	For you recall , brethren , our labor and hardship , how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you , we proclaimed to you the gospel of God .
52:2:010:0	You are witnesses , and so is God , how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers ;
52:2:011:0	just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his own children ,
52:2:012:0	so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory .
52:2:013:0	For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us , you accepted it not as the word of men , but for what it really is , the word of God , which also performs its work in you who believe .
52:2:014:0	For you , brethren , became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea , for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen , even as they did from the Jews ,
52:2:015:0	who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out . They are not pleasing to God , but hostile to all men ,
52:2:016:0	hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved ; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins . But wrath has come upon them to the utmost .
52:2:017:0	But we , brethren , having been taken away from you for a short while—in person , not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see your face .
52:2:018:0	For we wanted to come to you—I , Paul , more than once—and yet Satan hindered us .
52:2:019:0	For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation ? Is it not even you , in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming ?
52:2:020:0	For you are our glory and joy .
