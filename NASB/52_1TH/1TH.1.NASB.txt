52:1:001:1	Thanksgiving for These Believers
52:1:001:0	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace .
52:1:002:0	We give thanks to God always for all of you , making mention of you in our prayers ;
52:1:003:0	constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father ,
52:1:004:0	knowing , brethren beloved by God , His choice of you ;
52:1:005:0	for our gospel did not come to you in word only , but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction ; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake .
52:1:006:0	You also became imitators of us and of the Lord , having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit ,
52:1:007:0	so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52:1:008:0	For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth , so that we have no need to say anything .
52:1:009:0	For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you , and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God ,
52:1:010:0	and to wait for His Son from heaven , whom He raised from the dead , that is Jesus , who rescues us from the wrath to come .
