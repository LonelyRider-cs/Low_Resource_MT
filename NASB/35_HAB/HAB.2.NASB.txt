35:2:001:1	God Answers the Prophet
35:2:001:0	I will stand on my guard postAnd station myself on the rampart ; And I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me , And how I may reply when I am reproved .
35:2:002:0	Then the Lord answered me and said , “ Record the visionAnd inscribe it on tablets , That the one who reads it may run .
35:2:003:0	For the vision is yet for the appointed time ; It hastens toward the goal and it will not fail . Though it tarries , wait for it ; For it will certainly come , it will not delay .
35:2:004:0	“ Behold , as for the proud one , His soul is not right within him ; But the righteous will live by his faith .
35:2:005:0	Furthermore , wine betrays the haughty man , So that he does not stay at home . He enlarges his appetite like Sheol , And he is like death , never satisfied . He also gathers to himself all nationsAnd collects to himself all peoples .
35:2:006:0	“ Will not all of these take up a taunt-song against him , Even mockery and insinuations against himAnd say , ‘Woe to him who increases what is not his—For how long—And makes himself rich with loans ? ’
35:2:007:0	Will not your creditors rise up suddenly , And those who collect from you awaken ? Indeed , you will become plunder for them .
35:2:008:0	Because you have looted many nations , All the remainder of the peoples will loot you—Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land , To the town and all its inhabitants .
35:2:009:0	“ Woe to him who gets evil gain for his houseTo put his nest on high , To be delivered from the hand of calamity !
35:2:010:0	You have devised a shameful thing for your houseBy cutting off many peoples ; So you are sinning against yourself .
35:2:011:0	Surely the stone will cry out from the wall , And the rafter will answer it from the framework .
35:2:012:0	“ Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshedAnd founds a town with violence !
35:2:013:0	Is it not indeed from the Lord of hostsThat peoples toil for fire , And nations grow weary for nothing ?
35:2:014:0	For the earth will be filledWith the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , As the waters cover the sea .
35:2:015:0	“ Woe to you who make your neighbors drink , Who mix in your venom even to make them drunkSo as to look on their nakedness !
35:2:016:0	You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor . Now you yourself drink and expose your own nakedness . The cup in the Lord’s right hand will come around to you , And utter disgrace will come upon your glory .
35:2:017:0	For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you , And the devastation of its beasts by which you terrified them , Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land , To the town and all its inhabitants .
35:2:018:0	“ What profit is the idol when its maker has carved it , Or an image , a teacher of falsehood ? For its maker trusts in his own handiworkWhen he fashions speechless idols .
35:2:019:0	Woe to him who says to a piece of wood , ‘Awake ! ’To a mute stone , ‘Arise ! ’ And that is your teacher ? Behold , it is overlaid with gold and silver , And there is no breath at all inside it .
35:2:020:0	But the Lord is in His holy temple . Let all the earth be silent before Him . ”
