35:3:001:1	God’s Deliverance of His People
35:3:001:0	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet , according to Shigionoth .
35:3:002:0	Lord , I have heard the report about You and I fear . O Lord , revive Your work in the midst of the years , In the midst of the years make it known ; In wrath remember mercy .
35:3:003:0	God comes from Teman , And the Holy One from Mount Paran . Selah . His splendor covers the heavens , And the earth is full of His praise .
35:3:004:0	His radiance is like the sunlight ; He has rays flashing from His hand , And there is the hiding of His power .
35:3:005:0	Before Him goes pestilence , And plague comes after Him .
35:3:006:0	He stood and surveyed the earth ; He looked and startled the nations . Yes , the perpetual mountains were shattered , The ancient hills collapsed . His ways are everlasting .
35:3:007:0	I saw the tents of Cushan under distress , The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling .
35:3:008:0	Did the Lord rage against the rivers , Or was Your anger against the rivers , Or was Your wrath against the sea , That You rode on Your horses , On Your chariots of salvation ?
35:3:009:0	Your bow was made bare , The rods of chastisement were sworn . Selah . You cleaved the earth with rivers .
35:3:010:0	The mountains saw You and quaked ; The downpour of waters swept by . The deep uttered forth its voice , It lifted high its hands .
35:3:011:0	Sun and moon stood in their places ; They went away at the light of Your arrows , At the radiance of Your gleaming spear .
35:3:012:0	In indignation You marched through the earth ; In anger You trampled the nations .
35:3:013:0	You went forth for the salvation of Your people , For the salvation of Your anointed . You struck the head of the house of the evilTo lay him open from thigh to neck . Selah .
35:3:014:0	You pierced with his own spearsThe head of his throngs . They stormed in to scatter us ; Their exultation was like thoseWho devour the oppressed in secret .
35:3:015:0	You trampled on the sea with Your horses , On the surge of many waters .
35:3:016:0	I heard and my inward parts trembled , At the sound my lips quivered . Decay enters my bones , And in my place I tremble . Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress , For the people to arise who will invade us .
35:3:017:0	Though the fig tree should not blossomAnd there be no fruit on the vines , Though the yield of the olive should failAnd the fields produce no food , Though the flock should be cut off from the foldAnd there be no cattle in the stalls ,
35:3:018:0	Yet I will exult in the Lord , I will rejoice in the God of my salvation .
35:3:019:0	The Lord God is my strength , And He has made my feet like hinds’ feet , And makes me walk on my high places . For the choir director , on my stringed instruments .
