35:1:001:1	Chaldeans Used to Punish Judah
35:1:001:0	The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw .
35:1:002:0	How long , O Lord , will I call for help , And You will not hear ? I cry out to You , “ Violence ! ” Yet You do not save .
35:1:003:0	Why do You make me see iniquity , And cause me to look on wickedness ? Yes , destruction and violence are before me ; Strife exists and contention arises .
35:1:004:0	Therefore the law is ignoredAnd justice is never upheld . For the wicked surround the righteous ; Therefore justice comes out perverted .
35:1:005:0	“ Look among the nations ! Observe ! Be astonished ! Wonder ! Because I am doing something in your days—You would not believe if you were told .
35:1:006:0	For behold , I am raising up the Chaldeans , That fierce and impetuous peopleWho march throughout the earthTo seize dwelling places which are not theirs .
35:1:007:0	They are dreaded and feared ; Their justice and authority originate with themselves .
35:1:008:0	Their horses are swifter than leopardsAnd keener than wolves in the evening . Their horsemen come galloping , Their horsemen come from afar ; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour .
35:1:009:0	All of them come for violence . Their horde of faces moves forward . They collect captives like sand .
35:1:010:0	They mock at kingsAnd rulers are a laughing matter to them . They laugh at every fortressAnd heap up rubble to capture it .
35:1:011:0	Then they will sweep through like the wind and pass on . But they will be held guilty , They whose strength is their god . ”
35:1:012:0	Are You not from everlasting , O Lord , my God , my Holy One ? We will not die . You , O Lord , have appointed them to judge ; And You , O Rock , have established them to correct .
35:1:013:0	Your eyes are too pure to approve evil , And You can not look on wickedness with favor . Why do You look with favorOn those who deal treacherously ? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow upThose more righteous than they ?
35:1:014:0	Why have You made men like the fish of the sea , Like creeping things without a ruler over them ?
35:1:015:0	The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook , Drag them away with their net , And gather them together in their fishing net . Therefore they rejoice and are glad .
35:1:016:0	Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their netAnd burn incense to their fishing net ; Because through these things their catch is large , And their food is plentiful .
35:1:017:0	Will they therefore empty their netAnd continually slay nations without sparing ?
