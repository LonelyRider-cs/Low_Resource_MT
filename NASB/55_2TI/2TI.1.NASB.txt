55:1:001:1	Timothy Charged to Guard His Trust
55:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus ,
55:1:002:0	To Timothy , my beloved son : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55:1:003:0	I thank God , whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did , as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day ,
55:1:004:0	longing to see you , even as I recall your tears , so that I may be filled with joy .
55:1:005:0	For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you , which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice , and I am sure that it is in you as well .
55:1:006:0	For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55:1:007:0	For God has not given us a spirit of timidity , but of power and love and discipline .
55:1:008:0	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner , but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God ,
55:1:009:0	who has saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity ,
55:1:010:0	but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus , who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel ,
55:1:011:0	for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher .
55:1:012:0	For this reason I also suffer these things , but I am not ashamed ; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day .
55:1:013:0	Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me , in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus .
55:1:014:0	Guard , through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us , the treasure which has been entrusted to you .
55:1:015:0	You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me , among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55:1:016:0	The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains ;
55:1:017:0	but when he was in Rome , he eagerly searched for me and found me—
55:1:018:0	the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus .
