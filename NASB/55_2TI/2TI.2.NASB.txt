55:2:001:1	Be Strong
55:2:001:0	You therefore , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
55:2:002:0	The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses , entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also .
55:2:003:0	Suffer hardship with me , as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55:2:004:0	No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life , so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier .
55:2:005:0	Also if anyone competes as an athlete , he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules .
55:2:006:0	The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops .
55:2:007:0	Consider what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in everything .
55:2:008:0	Remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , descendant of David , according to my gospel ,
55:2:009:0	for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal ; but the word of God is not imprisoned .
55:2:010:0	For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen , so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory .
55:2:011:0	It is a trustworthy statement : For if we died with Him , we will also live with Him ;
55:2:012:0	If we endure , we will also reign with Him ; If we deny Him , He also will deny us ;
55:2:002:1	An Unashamed Workman
55:2:013:0	If we are faithless , He remains faithful , for He cannot deny Himself .
55:2:014:0	Remind them of these things , and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words , which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers .
55:2:015:0	Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed , accurately handling the word of truth .
55:2:016:0	But avoid worldly and empty chatter , for it will lead to further ungodliness ,
55:2:017:0	and their talk will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55:2:018:0	men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place , and they upset the faith of some .
55:2:019:0	Nevertheless , the firm foundation of God stands , having this seal , “ The Lord knows those who are His , ” and , “ Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness . ”
55:2:020:0	Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels , but also vessels of wood and of earthenware , and some to honor and some to dishonor .
55:2:021:0	Therefore , if anyone cleanses himself from these things , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , useful to the Master , prepared for every good work .
55:2:022:0	Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness , faith , love and peace , with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
55:2:023:0	But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations , knowing that they produce quarrels .
55:2:024:0	The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome , but be kind to all , able to teach , patient when wronged ,
55:2:025:0	with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition , if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth ,
55:2:026:0	and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil , having been held captive by him to do his will .
