55:4:001:1	“ Preach the Word ”
55:4:001:0	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who is to judge the living and the dead , and by His appearing and His kingdom :
55:4:002:0	preach the word ; be ready in season and out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort , with great patience and instruction .
55:4:003:0	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but wanting to have their ears tickled , they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires ,
55:4:004:0	and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths .
55:4:005:0	But you , be sober in all things , endure hardship , do the work of an evangelist , fulfill your ministry .
55:4:006:0	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering , and the time of my departure has come .
55:4:007:0	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the course , I have kept the faith ;
55:4:002:1	Personal Concerns
55:4:008:0	in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on that day ; and not only to me , but also to all who have loved His appearing .
55:4:009:0	Make every effort to come to me soon ;
55:4:010:0	for Demas , having loved this present world , has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica ; Crescens has gone to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
55:4:011:0	Only Luke is with me . Pick up Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for service .
55:4:012:0	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
55:4:013:0	When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus , and the books , especially the parchments .
55:4:014:0	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm ; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds .
55:4:015:0	Be on guard against him yourself , for he vigorously opposed our teaching .
55:4:016:0	At my first defense no one supported me , but all deserted me ; may it not be counted against them .
55:4:017:0	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me , so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth .
55:4:018:0	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed , and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom ; to Him be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
55:4:019:0	Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
55:4:020:0	Erastus remained at Corinth , but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus .
55:4:021:0	Make every effort to come before winter . Eubulus greets you , also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren .
55:4:022:0	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
