48:4:001:1	Sonship in Christ
48:4:001:0	Now I say , as long as the heir is a child , he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything ,
48:4:002:0	but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father .
48:4:003:0	So also we , while we were children , were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world .
48:4:004:0	But when the fullness of the time came , God sent forth His Son , born of a woman , born under the Law ,
48:4:005:0	so that He might redeem those who were under the Law , that we might receive the adoption as sons .
48:4:006:0	Because you are sons , God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts , crying , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
48:4:007:0	Therefore you are no longer a slave , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir through God .
48:4:008:0	However at that time , when you did not know God , you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods .
48:4:009:0	But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things , to which you desire to be enslaved all over again ?
48:4:010:0	You observe days and months and seasons and years .
48:4:011:0	I fear for you , that perhaps I have labored over you in vain .
48:4:012:0	I beg of you , brethren , become as I am , for I also have become as you are . You have done me no wrong ;
48:4:013:0	but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time ;
48:4:014:0	and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe , but you received me as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus Himself .
48:4:015:0	Where then is that sense of blessing you had ? For I bear you witness that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
48:4:016:0	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48:4:017:0	They eagerly seek you , not commendably , but they wish to shut you out so that you will seek them .
48:4:018:0	But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner , and not only when I am present with you .
48:4:019:0	My children , with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you—
48:4:002:1	Bond and Free
48:4:020:0	but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
48:4:021:0	Tell me , you who want to be under law , do you not listen to the law ?
48:4:022:0	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman .
48:4:023:0	But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh , and the son by the free woman through the promise .
48:4:024:0	This is allegorically speaking , for these women are two covenants : one proceeding from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves ; she is Hagar .
48:4:025:0	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
48:4:026:0	But the Jerusalem above is free ; she is our mother .
48:4:027:0	For it is written , “ Rejoice , barren woman who does not bear ; Break forth and shout , you who are not in labor ; For more numerous are the children of the desolateThan of the one who has a husband . ”
48:4:028:0	And you brethren , like Isaac , are children of promise .
48:4:029:0	But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so it is now also .
48:4:030:0	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Cast out the bondwoman and her son , For the son of the bondwoman shall not be an heir with the son of the free woman . ”
48:4:031:0	So then , brethren , we are not children of a bondwoman , but of the free woman .
