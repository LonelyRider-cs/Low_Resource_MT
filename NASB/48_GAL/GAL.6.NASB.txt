48:6:001:1	Bear One Another’s Burdens
48:6:001:0	Brethren , even if anyone is caught in any trespass , you who are spiritual , restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; each one looking to yourself , so that you too will not be tempted .
48:6:002:0	Bear one another’s burdens , and thereby fulfill the law of Christ .
48:6:003:0	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
48:6:004:0	But each one must examine his own work , and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone , and not in regard to another .
48:6:005:0	For each one will bear his own load .
48:6:006:0	The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him .
48:6:007:0	Do not be deceived , God is not mocked ; for whatever a man sows , this he will also reap .
48:6:008:0	For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption , but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
48:6:009:0	Let us not lose heart in doing good , for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary .
48:6:010:0	So then , while we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , and especially to those who are of the household of the faith .
48:6:011:0	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand .
48:6:012:0	Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised , simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48:6:013:0	For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh .
48:6:014:0	But may it never be that I would boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48:6:015:0	For neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
48:6:016:0	And those who will walk by this rule , peace and mercy be upon them , and upon the Israel of God .
48:6:017:0	From now on let no one cause trouble for me , for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus .
48:6:018:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brethren . Amen .
