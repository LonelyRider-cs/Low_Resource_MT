48:5:001:1	Walk by the Spirit
48:5:001:0	It was for freedom that Christ set us free ; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery .
48:5:002:0	Behold I , Paul , say to you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will be of no benefit to you .
48:5:003:0	And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision , that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law .
48:5:004:0	You have been severed from Christ , you who are seeking to be justified by law ; you have fallen from grace .
48:5:005:0	For we through the Spirit , by faith , are waiting for the hope of righteousness .
48:5:006:0	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything , but faith working through love .
48:5:007:0	You were running well ; who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
48:5:008:0	This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you .
48:5:009:0	A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough .
48:5:010:0	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view ; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
48:5:011:0	But I , brethren , if I still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished .
48:5:012:0	I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves .
48:5:013:0	For you were called to freedom , brethren ; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh , but through love serve one another .
48:5:014:0	For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word , in the statement , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
48:5:015:0	But if you bite and devour one another , take care that you are not consumed by one another .
48:5:016:0	But I say , walk by the Spirit , and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh .
48:5:017:0	For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; for these are in opposition to one another , so that you may not do the things that you please .
48:5:018:0	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the Law .
48:5:019:0	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident , which are : immorality , impurity , sensuality ,
48:5:020:0	idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , disputes , dissensions , factions ,
48:5:021:0	envying , drunkenness , carousing , and things like these , of which I forewarn you , just as I have forewarned you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
48:5:022:0	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48:5:023:0	gentleness , self-control ; against such things there is no law .
48:5:024:0	Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
48:5:025:0	If we live by the Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit .
48:5:026:0	Let us not become boastful , challenging one another , envying one another .
