48:2:001:1	The Council at Jerusalem
48:2:001:0	Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus along also .
48:2:002:0	It was because of a revelation that I went up ; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but I did so in private to those who were of reputation , for fear that I might be running , or had run , in vain .
48:2:003:0	But not even Titus , who was with me , though he was a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
48:2:004:0	But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in , who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , in order to bring us into bondage .
48:2:005:0	But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour , so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you .
48:2:006:0	But from those who were of high reputation ( what they were makes no difference to me ; God shows no partiality ) —well , those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me .
48:2:007:0	But on the contrary , seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter had been to the circumcised
48:2:008:0	( for He who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles ) ,
48:2:009:0	and recognizing the grace that had been given to me , James and Cephas and John , who were reputed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised .
48:2:002:1	Peter ( Cephas ) Opposed by Paul
48:2:010:0	They only asked us to remember the poor—the very thing I also was eager to do .
48:2:011:0	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he stood condemned .
48:2:012:0	For prior to the coming of certain men from James , he used to eat with the Gentiles ; but when they came , he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof , fearing the party of the circumcision .
48:2:013:0	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy , with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy .
48:2:014:0	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in the presence of all , “ If you , being a Jew , live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews , how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ?
48:2:015:0	“ We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles ;
48:2:016:0	nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus , even we have believed in Christ Jesus , so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law ; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified .
48:2:017:0	But if , while seeking to be justified in Christ , we ourselves have also been found sinners , is Christ then a minister of sin ? May it never be !
48:2:018:0	For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed , I prove myself to be a transgressor .
48:2:019:0	For through the Law I died to the Law , so that I might live to God .
48:2:020:0	I have been crucified with Christ ; and it is no longer I who live , but Christ lives in me ; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave Himself up for me .
48:2:021:0	I do not nullify the grace of God , for if righteousness comes through the Law , then Christ died needlessly . ”
