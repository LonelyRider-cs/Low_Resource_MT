20:25:001:1	Similitudes , Instructions
20:25:001:0	These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah , king of Judah , transcribed .
20:25:002:0	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter , But the glory of kings is to search out a matter .
20:25:003:0	As the heavens for height and the earth for depth , So the heart of kings is unsearchable .
20:25:004:0	Take away the dross from the silver , And there comes out a vessel for the smith ;
20:25:005:0	Take away the wicked before the king , And his throne will be established in righteousness .
20:25:006:0	Do not claim honor in the presence of the king , And do not stand in the place of great men ;
20:25:007:0	For it is better that it be said to you , “ Come up here , ” Than for you to be placed lower in the presence of the prince , Whom your eyes have seen .
20:25:008:0	Do not go out hastily to argue your case ; Otherwise , what will you do in the end , When your neighbor humiliates you ?
20:25:009:0	Argue your case with your neighbor , And do not reveal the secret of another ,
20:25:010:0	Or he who hears it will reproach you , And the evil report about you will not pass away .
20:25:011:0	Like apples of gold in settings of silverIs a word spoken in right circumstances .
20:25:012:0	Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine goldIs a wise reprover to a listening ear .
20:25:013:0	Like the cold of snow in the time of harvestIs a faithful messenger to those who send him , For he refreshes the soul of his masters .
20:25:014:0	Like clouds and wind without rainIs a man who boasts of his gifts falsely .
20:25:015:0	By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded , And a soft tongue breaks the bone .
20:25:016:0	Have you found honey ? Eat only what you need , That you not have it in excess and vomit it .
20:25:017:0	Let your foot rarely be in your neighbor’s house , Or he will become weary of you and hate you .
20:25:018:0	Like a club and a sword and a sharp arrowIs a man who bears false witness against his neighbor .
20:25:019:0	Like a bad tooth and an unsteady footIs confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble .
20:25:020:0	Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day , or like vinegar on soda , Is he who sings songs to a troubled heart .
20:25:021:0	If your enemy is hungry , give him food to eat ; And if he is thirsty , give him water to drink ;
20:25:022:0	For you will heap burning coals on his head , And the Lord will reward you .
20:25:023:0	The north wind brings forth rain , And a backbiting tongue , an angry countenance .
20:25:024:0	It is better to live in a corner of the roofThan in a house shared with a contentious woman .
20:25:025:0	Like cold water to a weary soul , So is good news from a distant land .
20:25:026:0	Like a trampled spring and a polluted wellIs a righteous man who gives way before the wicked .
20:25:027:0	It is not good to eat much honey , Nor is it glory to search out one’s own glory .
20:25:028:0	Like a city that is broken into and without wallsIs a man who has no control over his spirit .
