20:7:001:1	The Wiles of the Harlot
20:7:001:0	My son , keep my wordsAnd treasure my commandments within you .
20:7:002:0	Keep my commandments and live , And my teaching as the apple of your eye .
20:7:003:0	Bind them on your fingers ; Write them on the tablet of your heart .
20:7:004:0	Say to wisdom , “ You are my sister , ” And call understanding your intimate friend ;
20:7:005:0	That they may keep you from an adulteress , From the foreigner who flatters with her words .
20:7:006:0	For at the window of my houseI looked out through my lattice ,
20:7:007:0	And I saw among the naive , And discerned among the youthsA young man lacking sense ,
20:7:008:0	Passing through the street near her corner ; And he takes the way to her house ,
20:7:009:0	In the twilight , in the evening , In the middle of the night and in the darkness .
20:7:010:0	And behold , a woman comes to meet him , Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart .
20:7:011:0	She is boisterous and rebellious , Her feet do not remain at home ;
20:7:012:0	She is now in the streets , now in the squares , And lurks by every corner .
20:7:013:0	So she seizes him and kisses himAnd with a brazen face she says to him :
20:7:014:0	“ I was due to offer peace offerings ; Today I have paid my vows .
20:7:015:0	Therefore I have come out to meet you , To seek your presence earnestly , and I have found you .
20:7:016:0	I have spread my couch with coverings , With colored linens of Egypt .
20:7:017:0	I have sprinkled my bedWith myrrh , aloes and cinnamon .
20:7:018:0	Come , let us drink our fill of love until morning ; Let us delight ourselves with caresses .
20:7:019:0	For my husband is not at home , He has gone on a long journey ;
20:7:020:0	He has taken a bag of money with him , At the full moon he will come home . ”
20:7:021:0	With her many persuasions she entices him ; With her flattering lips she seduces him .
20:7:022:0	Suddenly he follows herAs an ox goes to the slaughter , Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool ,
20:7:023:0	Until an arrow pierces through his liver ; As a bird hastens to the snare , So he does not know that it will cost him his life .
20:7:024:0	Now therefore , my sons , listen to me , And pay attention to the words of my mouth .
20:7:025:0	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways , Do not stray into her paths .
20:7:026:0	For many are the victims she has cast down , And numerous are all her slain .
20:7:027:0	Her house is the way to Sheol , Descending to the chambers of death .
