20:20:001:1	On Life and Conduct
20:20:001:0	Wine is a mocker , strong drink a brawler , And whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise .
20:20:002:0	The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion ; He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life .
20:20:003:0	Keeping away from strife is an honor for a man , But any fool will quarrel .
20:20:004:0	The sluggard does not plow after the autumn , So he begs during the harvest and has nothing .
20:20:005:0	A plan in the heart of a man is like deep water , But a man of understanding draws it out .
20:20:006:0	Many a man proclaims his own loyalty , But who can find a trustworthy man ?
20:20:007:0	A righteous man who walks in his integrity—How blessed are his sons after him .
20:20:008:0	A king who sits on the throne of justiceDisperses all evil with his eyes .
20:20:009:0	Who can say , “ I have cleansed my heart , I am pure from my sin ” ?
20:20:010:0	Differing weights and differing measures , Both of them are abominable to the Lord .
20:20:011:0	It is by his deeds that a lad distinguishes himselfIf his conduct is pure and right .
20:20:012:0	The hearing ear and the seeing eye , The Lord has made both of them .
20:20:013:0	Do not love sleep , or you will become poor ; Open your eyes , and you will be satisfied with food .
20:20:014:0	“ Bad , bad , ” says the buyer , But when he goes his way , then he boasts .
20:20:015:0	There is gold , and an abundance of jewels ; But the lips of knowledge are a more precious thing .
20:20:016:0	Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger ; And for foreigners , hold him in pledge .
20:20:017:0	Bread obtained by falsehood is sweet to a man , But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel .
20:20:018:0	Prepare plans by consultation , And make war by wise guidance .
20:20:019:0	He who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets , Therefore do not associate with a gossip .
20:20:020:0	He who curses his father or his mother , His lamp will go out in time of darkness .
20:20:021:0	An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginningWill not be blessed in the end .
20:20:022:0	Do not say , “ I will repay evil ” ; Wait for the Lord , and He will save you .
20:20:023:0	Differing weights are an abomination to the Lord , And a false scale is not good .
20:20:024:0	Man’s steps are ordained by the Lord , How then can man understand his way ?
20:20:025:0	It is a trap for a man to say rashly , “ It is holy ! ” And after the vows to make inquiry .
20:20:026:0	A wise king winnows the wicked , And drives the threshing wheel over them .
20:20:027:0	The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord , Searching all the innermost parts of his being .
20:20:028:0	Loyalty and truth preserve the king , And he upholds his throne by righteousness .
20:20:029:0	The glory of young men is their strength , And the honor of old men is their gray hair .
20:20:030:0	Stripes that wound scour away evil , And strokes reach the innermost parts .
