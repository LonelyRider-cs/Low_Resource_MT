20:24:001:1	Precepts and Warnings
20:24:001:0	Do not be envious of evil men , Nor desire to be with them ;
20:24:002:0	For their minds devise violence , And their lips talk of trouble .
20:24:003:0	By wisdom a house is built , And by understanding it is established ;
20:24:004:0	And by knowledge the rooms are filledWith all precious and pleasant riches .
20:24:005:0	A wise man is strong , And a man of knowledge increases power .
20:24:006:0	For by wise guidance you will wage war , And in abundance of counselors there is victory .
20:24:007:0	Wisdom is too exalted for a fool , He does not open his mouth in the gate .
20:24:008:0	One who plans to do evil , Men will call a schemer .
20:24:009:0	The devising of folly is sin , And the scoffer is an abomination to men .
20:24:010:0	If you are slack in the day of distress , Your strength is limited .
20:24:011:0	Deliver those who are being taken away to death , And those who are staggering to slaughter , Oh hold them back .
20:24:012:0	If you say , “ See , we did not know this , ” Does He not consider it who weighs the hearts ? And does He not know it who keeps your soul ? And will He not render to man according to his work ?
20:24:013:0	My son , eat honey , for it is good , Yes , the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste ;
20:24:014:0	Know that wisdom is thus for your soul ; If you find it , then there will be a future , And your hope will not be cut off .
20:24:015:0	Do not lie in wait , O wicked man , against the dwelling of the righteous ; Do not destroy his resting place ;
20:24:016:0	For a righteous man falls seven times , and rises again , But the wicked stumble in time of calamity .
20:24:017:0	Do not rejoice when your enemy falls , And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles ;
20:24:018:0	Or the Lord will see it and be displeased , And turn His anger away from him .
20:24:019:0	Do not fret because of evildoersOr be envious of the wicked ;
20:24:020:0	For there will be no future for the evil man ; The lamp of the wicked will be put out .
20:24:021:0	My son , fear the Lord and the king ; Do not associate with those who are given to change ,
20:24:022:0	For their calamity will rise suddenly , And who knows the ruin that comes from both of them ?
20:24:023:0	These also are sayings of the wise . To show partiality in judgment is not good .
20:24:024:0	He who says to the wicked , “ You are righteous , ” Peoples will curse him , nations will abhor him ;
20:24:025:0	But to those who rebuke the wicked will be delight , And a good blessing will come upon them .
20:24:026:0	He kisses the lipsWho gives a right answer .
20:24:027:0	Prepare your work outsideAnd make it ready for yourself in the field ; Afterwards , then , build your house .
20:24:028:0	Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause , And do not deceive with your lips .
20:24:029:0	Do not say , “ Thus I shall do to him as he has done to me ; I will render to the man according to his work . ”
20:24:030:0	I passed by the field of the sluggardAnd by the vineyard of the man lacking sense ,
20:24:031:0	And behold , it was completely overgrown with thistles ; Its surface was covered with nettles , And its stone wall was broken down .
20:24:032:0	When I saw , I reflected upon it ; I looked , and received instruction .
20:24:033:0	“ A little sleep , a little slumber , A little folding of the hands to rest , ”
20:24:034:0	Then your poverty will come as a robberAnd your want like an armed man .
