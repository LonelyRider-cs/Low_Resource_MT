20:18:001:1	Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
20:18:001:0	He who separates himself seeks his own desire , He quarrels against all sound wisdom .
20:18:002:0	A fool does not delight in understanding , But only in revealing his own mind .
20:18:003:0	When a wicked man comes , contempt also comes , And with dishonor comes scorn .
20:18:004:0	The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters ; The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook .
20:18:005:0	To show partiality to the wicked is not good , Nor to thrust aside the righteous in judgment .
20:18:006:0	A fool’s lips bring strife , And his mouth calls for blows .
20:18:007:0	A fool’s mouth is his ruin , And his lips are the snare of his soul .
20:18:008:0	The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels , And they go down into the innermost parts of the body .
20:18:009:0	He also who is slack in his workIs brother to him who destroys .
20:18:010:0	The name of the Lord is a strong tower ; The righteous runs into it and is safe .
20:18:011:0	A rich man’s wealth is his strong city , And like a high wall in his own imagination .
20:18:012:0	Before destruction the heart of man is haughty , But humility goes before honor .
20:18:013:0	He who gives an answer before he hears , It is folly and shame to him .
20:18:014:0	The spirit of a man can endure his sickness , But as for a broken spirit who can bear it ?
20:18:015:0	The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge , And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge .
20:18:016:0	A man’s gift makes room for himAnd brings him before great men .
20:18:017:0	The first to plead his case seems right , Until another comes and examines him .
20:18:018:0	The cast lot puts an end to strifeAnd decides between the mighty ones .
20:18:019:0	A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city , And contentions are like the bars of a citadel .
20:18:020:0	With the fruit of a man’s mouth his stomach will be satisfied ; He will be satisfied with the product of his lips .
20:18:021:0	Death and life are in the power of the tongue , And those who love it will eat its fruit .
20:18:022:0	He who finds a wife finds a good thingAnd obtains favor from the Lord .
20:18:023:0	The poor man utters supplications , But the rich man answers roughly .
20:18:024:0	A man of too many friends comes to ruin , But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother .
