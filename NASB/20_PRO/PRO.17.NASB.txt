20:17:001:1	Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
20:17:001:0	Better is a dry morsel and quietness with itThan a house full of feasting with strife .
20:17:002:0	A servant who acts wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully , And will share in the inheritance among brothers .
20:17:003:0	The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold , But the Lord tests hearts .
20:17:004:0	An evildoer listens to wicked lips ; A liar pays attention to a destructive tongue .
20:17:005:0	He who mocks the poor taunts his Maker ; He who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished .
20:17:006:0	Grandchildren are the crown of old men , And the glory of sons is their fathers .
20:17:007:0	Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool , Much less are lying lips to a prince .
20:17:008:0	A bribe is a charm in the sight of its owner ; Wherever he turns , he prospers .
20:17:009:0	He who conceals a transgression seeks love , But he who repeats a matter separates intimate friends .
20:17:010:0	A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understandingThan a hundred blows into a fool .
20:17:011:0	A rebellious man seeks only evil , So a cruel messenger will be sent against him .
20:17:012:0	Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs , Rather than a fool in his folly .
20:17:013:0	He who returns evil for good , Evil will not depart from his house .
20:17:014:0	The beginning of strife is like letting out water , So abandon the quarrel before it breaks out .
20:17:015:0	He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous , Both of them alike are an abomination to the Lord .
20:17:016:0	Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom , When he has no sense ?
20:17:017:0	A friend loves at all times , And a brother is born for adversity .
20:17:018:0	A man lacking in sense pledgesAnd becomes guarantor in the presence of his neighbor .
20:17:019:0	He who loves transgression loves strife ; He who raises his door seeks destruction .
20:17:020:0	He who has a crooked mind finds no good , And he who is perverted in his language falls into evil .
20:17:021:0	He who sires a fool does so to his sorrow , And the father of a fool has no joy .
20:17:022:0	A joyful heart is good medicine , But a broken spirit dries up the bones .
20:17:023:0	A wicked man receives a bribe from the bosomTo pervert the ways of justice .
20:17:024:0	Wisdom is in the presence of the one who has understanding , But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth .
20:17:025:0	A foolish son is a grief to his fatherAnd bitterness to her who bore him .
20:17:026:0	It is also not good to fine the righteous , Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness .
20:17:027:0	He who restrains his words has knowledge , And he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding .
20:17:028:0	Even a fool , when he keeps silent , is considered wise ; When he closes his lips , he is considered prudent .
