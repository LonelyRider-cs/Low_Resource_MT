20:8:001:1	The Commendation of Wisdom
20:8:001:0	Does not wisdom call , And understanding lift up her voice ?
20:8:002:0	On top of the heights beside the way , Where the paths meet , she takes her stand ;
20:8:003:0	Beside the gates , at the opening to the city , At the entrance of the doors , she cries out :
20:8:004:0	“ To you , O men , I call , And my voice is to the sons of men .
20:8:005:0	O naive ones , understand prudence ; And , O fools , understand wisdom .
20:8:006:0	Listen , for I will speak noble things ; And the opening of my lips will reveal right things .
20:8:007:0	For my mouth will utter truth ; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips .
20:8:008:0	All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness ; There is nothing crooked or perverted in them .
20:8:009:0	They are all straightforward to him who understands , And right to those who find knowledge .
20:8:010:0	Take my instruction and not silver , And knowledge rather than choicest gold .
20:8:011:0	For wisdom is better than jewels ; And all desirable things cannot compare with her .
20:8:012:0	“ I , wisdom , dwell with prudence , And I find knowledge and discretion .
20:8:013:0	The fear of the Lord is to hate evil ; Pride and arrogance and the evil wayAnd the perverted mouth , I hate .
20:8:014:0	Counsel is mine and sound wisdom ; I am understanding , power is mine .
20:8:015:0	By me kings reign , And rulers decree justice .
20:8:016:0	By me princes rule , and nobles , All who judge rightly .
20:8:017:0	I love those who love me ; And those who diligently seek me will find me .
20:8:018:0	Riches and honor are with me , Enduring wealth and righteousness .
20:8:019:0	My fruit is better than gold , even pure gold , And my yield better than choicest silver .
20:8:020:0	I walk in the way of righteousness , In the midst of the paths of justice ,
20:8:021:0	To endow those who love me with wealth , That I may fill their treasuries .
20:8:022:0	“ The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way , Before His works of old .
20:8:023:0	From everlasting I was established , From the beginning , from the earliest times of the earth .
20:8:024:0	When there were no depths I was brought forth , When there were no springs abounding with water .
20:8:025:0	Before the mountains were settled , Before the hills I was brought forth ;
20:8:026:0	While He had not yet made the earth and the fields , Nor the first dust of the world .
20:8:027:0	When He established the heavens , I was there , When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep ,
20:8:028:0	When He made firm the skies above , When the springs of the deep became fixed ,
20:8:029:0	When He set for the sea its boundarySo that the water would not transgress His command , When He marked out the foundations of the earth ;
20:8:030:0	Then I was beside Him , as a master workman ; And I was daily His delight , Rejoicing always before Him ,
20:8:031:0	Rejoicing in the world , His earth , And having my delight in the sons of men .
20:8:032:0	“ Now therefore , O sons , listen to me , For blessed are they who keep my ways .
20:8:033:0	Heed instruction and be wise , And do not neglect it .
20:8:034:0	Blessed is the man who listens to me , Watching daily at my gates , Waiting at my doorposts .
20:8:035:0	For he who finds me finds lifeAnd obtains favor from the Lord .
20:8:036:0	But he who sins against me injures himself ; All those who hate me love death . ”
