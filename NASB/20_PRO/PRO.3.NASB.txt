20:3:001:1	The Rewards of Wisdom
20:3:001:0	My son , do not forget my teaching , But let your heart keep my commandments ;
20:3:002:0	For length of days and years of lifeAnd peace they will add to you .
20:3:003:0	Do not let kindness and truth leave you ; Bind them around your neck , Write them on the tablet of your heart .
20:3:004:0	So you will find favor and good reputeIn the sight of God and man .
20:3:005:0	Trust in the Lord with all your heartAnd do not lean on your own understanding .
20:3:006:0	In all your ways acknowledge Him , And He will make your paths straight .
20:3:007:0	Do not be wise in your own eyes ; Fear the Lord and turn away from evil .
20:3:008:0	It will be healing to your bodyAnd refreshment to your bones .
20:3:009:0	Honor the Lord from your wealthAnd from the first of all your produce ;
20:3:010:0	So your barns will be filled with plentyAnd your vats will overflow with new wine .
20:3:011:0	My son , do not reject the discipline of the LordOr loathe His reproof ,
20:3:012:0	For whom the Lord loves He reproves , Even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights .
20:3:013:0	How blessed is the man who finds wisdomAnd the man who gains understanding .
20:3:014:0	For her profit is better than the profit of silverAnd her gain better than fine gold .
20:3:015:0	She is more precious than jewels ; And nothing you desire compares with her .
20:3:016:0	Long life is in her right hand ; In her left hand are riches and honor .
20:3:017:0	Her ways are pleasant waysAnd all her paths are peace .
20:3:018:0	She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her , And happy are all who hold her fast .
20:3:019:0	The Lord by wisdom founded the earth , By understanding He established the heavens .
20:3:020:0	By His knowledge the deeps were broken upAnd the skies drip with dew .
20:3:021:0	My son , let them not vanish from your sight ; Keep sound wisdom and discretion ,
20:3:022:0	So they will be life to your soulAnd adornment to your neck .
20:3:023:0	Then you will walk in your way securelyAnd your foot will not stumble .
20:3:024:0	When you lie down , you will not be afraid ; When you lie down , your sleep will be sweet .
20:3:025:0	Do not be afraid of sudden fearNor of the onslaught of the wicked when it comes ;
20:3:026:0	For the Lord will be your confidenceAnd will keep your foot from being caught .
20:3:027:0	Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due , When it is in your power to do it .
20:3:028:0	Do not say to your neighbor , “ Go , and come back , And tomorrow I will give it , ” When you have it with you .
20:3:029:0	Do not devise harm against your neighbor , While he lives securely beside you .
20:3:030:0	Do not contend with a man without cause , If he has done you no harm .
20:3:031:0	Do not envy a man of violenceAnd do not choose any of his ways .
20:3:032:0	For the devious are an abomination to the Lord ; But He is intimate with the upright .
20:3:033:0	The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked , But He blesses the dwelling of the righteous .
20:3:034:0	Though He scoffs at the scoffers , Yet He gives grace to the afflicted .
20:3:035:0	The wise will inherit honor , But fools display dishonor .
