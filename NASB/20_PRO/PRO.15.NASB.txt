20:15:001:0	A gentle answer turns away wrath , But a harsh word stirs up anger .
20:15:002:0	The tongue of the wise makes knowledge acceptable , But the mouth of fools spouts folly .
20:15:003:0	The eyes of the Lord are in every place , Watching the evil and the good .
20:15:004:0	A soothing tongue is a tree of life , But perversion in it crushes the spirit .
20:15:005:0	A fool rejects his fatherâ€™s discipline , But he who regards reproof is sensible .

20:15:007:0	The lips of the wise spread knowledge , But the hearts of fools are not so .

20:15:011:0	Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord , How much more the hearts of men !
20:15:012:0	A scoffer does not love one who reproves him , He will not go to the wise .
20:15:013:0	A joyful heart makes a cheerful face , But when the heart is sad , the spirit is broken .
20:15:014:0	The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge , But the mouth of fools feeds on folly .
20:15:015:0	All the days of the afflicted are bad , But a cheerful heart has a continual feast .
20:15:016:0	Better is a little with the fear of the LordThan great treasure and turmoil with it .
20:15:017:0	Better is a dish of vegetables where love isThan a fattened ox served with hatred .
20:15:018:0	A hot-tempered man stirs up strife , But the slow to anger calms a dispute .
20:15:019:0	The way of the lazy is as a hedge of thorns , But the path of the upright is a highway .
20:15:020:0	A wise son makes a father glad , But a foolish man despises his mother .
20:15:021:0	Folly is joy to him who lacks sense , But a man of understanding walks straight .
20:15:022:0	Without consultation , plans are frustrated , But with many counselors they succeed .
20:15:023:0	A man has joy in an apt answer , And how delightful is a timely word !
20:15:024:0	The path of life leads upward for the wiseThat he may keep away from Sheol below .
20:15:025:0	The Lord will tear down the house of the proud , But He will establish the boundary of the widow .
20:15:026:0	Evil plans are an abomination to the Lord , But pleasant words are pure .
20:15:027:0	He who profits illicitly troubles his own house , But he who hates bribes will live .
20:15:028:0	The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer , But the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things .
20:15:029:0	The Lord is far from the wicked , But He hears the prayer of the righteous .
20:15:030:0	Bright eyes gladden the heart ; Good news puts fat on the bones .
20:15:031:0	He whose ear listens to the life-giving reproofWill dwell among the wise .
20:15:032:0	He who neglects discipline despises himself , But he who listens to reproof acquires understanding .
20:15:033:0	The fear of the Lord is the instruction for wisdom , And before honor comes humility .
