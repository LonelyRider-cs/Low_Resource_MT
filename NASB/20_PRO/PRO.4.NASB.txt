20:4:001:1	A Father’s Instruction
20:4:001:0	Hear , O sons , the instruction of a father , And give attention that you may gain understanding ,
20:4:002:0	For I give you sound teaching ; Do not abandon my instruction .
20:4:003:0	When I was a son to my father , Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother ,
20:4:004:0	Then he taught me and said to me , “ Let your heart hold fast my words ; Keep my commandments and live ;
20:4:005:0	Acquire wisdom ! Acquire understanding ! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth .
20:4:006:0	Do not forsake her , and she will guard you ; Love her , and she will watch over you .
20:4:007:0	The beginning of wisdom is : Acquire wisdom ; And with all your acquiring , get understanding .
20:4:008:0	Prize her , and she will exalt you ; She will honor you if you embrace her .
20:4:009:0	She will place on your head a garland of grace ; She will present you with a crown of beauty . ”
20:4:010:0	Hear , my son , and accept my sayingsAnd the years of your life will be many .
20:4:011:0	I have directed you in the way of wisdom ; I have led you in upright paths .
20:4:012:0	When you walk , your steps will not be impeded ; And if you run , you will not stumble .
20:4:013:0	Take hold of instruction ; do not let go . Guard her , for she is your life .
20:4:014:0	Do not enter the path of the wickedAnd do not proceed in the way of evil men .
20:4:015:0	Avoid it , do not pass by it ; Turn away from it and pass on .
20:4:016:0	For they cannot sleep unless they do evil ; And they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble .
20:4:017:0	For they eat the bread of wickednessAnd drink the wine of violence .
20:4:018:0	But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn , That shines brighter and brighter until the full day .
20:4:019:0	The way of the wicked is like darkness ; They do not know over what they stumble .
20:4:020:0	My son , give attention to my words ; Incline your ear to my sayings .
20:4:021:0	Do not let them depart from your sight ; Keep them in the midst of your heart .
20:4:022:0	For they are life to those who find themAnd health to all their body .
20:4:023:0	Watch over your heart with all diligence , For from it flow the springs of life .
20:4:024:0	Put away from you a deceitful mouthAnd put devious speech far from you .
20:4:025:0	Let your eyes look directly aheadAnd let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you .
20:4:026:0	Watch the path of your feetAnd all your ways will be established .
20:4:027:0	Do not turn to the right nor to the left ; Turn your foot from evil .
