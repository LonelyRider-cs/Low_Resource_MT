20:6:001:1	Parental Counsel
20:6:001:0	My son , if you have become surety for your neighbor , Have given a pledge for a stranger ,
20:6:002:0	If you have been snared with the words of your mouth , Have been caught with the words of your mouth ,
20:6:003:0	Do this then , my son , and deliver yourself ; Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor , Go , humble yourself , and importune your neighbor .
20:6:004:0	Give no sleep to your eyes , Nor slumber to your eyelids ;
20:6:005:0	Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter’s handAnd like a bird from the hand of the fowler .
20:6:006:0	Go to the ant , O sluggard , Observe her ways and be wise ,
20:6:007:0	Which , having no chief , Officer or ruler ,
20:6:008:0	Prepares her food in the summer And gathers her provision in the harvest .
20:6:009:0	How long will you lie down , O sluggard ? When will you arise from your sleep ?
20:6:010:0	“ A little sleep , a little slumber , A little folding of the hands to rest ” —
20:6:011:0	Your poverty will come in like a vagabondAnd your need like an armed man .
20:6:012:0	A worthless person , a wicked man , Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth ,
20:6:013:0	Who winks with his eyes , who signals with his feet , Who points with his fingers ;
20:6:014:0	Who with perversity in his heart continually devises evil , Who spreads strife .
20:6:015:0	Therefore his calamity will come suddenly ; Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing .
20:6:016:0	There are six things which the Lord hates , Yes , seven which are an abomination to Him :
20:6:017:0	Haughty eyes , a lying tongue , And hands that shed innocent blood ,
20:6:018:0	A heart that devises wicked plans , Feet that run rapidly to evil ,
20:6:019:0	A false witness who utters lies , And one who spreads strife among brothers .
20:6:020:0	My son , observe the commandment of your fatherAnd do not forsake the teaching of your mother ;
20:6:021:0	Bind them continually on your heart ; Tie them around your neck .
20:6:022:0	When you walk about , they will guide you ; When you sleep , they will watch over you ; And when you awake , they will talk to you .
20:6:023:0	For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light ; And reproofs for discipline are the way of life
20:6:024:0	To keep you from the evil woman , From the smooth tongue of the adulteress .
20:6:025:0	Do not desire her beauty in your heart , Nor let her capture you with her eyelids .
20:6:026:0	For on account of a harlot one is reduced to a loaf of bread , And an adulteress hunts for the precious life .
20:6:027:0	Can a man take fire in his bosomAnd his clothes not be burned ?
20:6:028:0	Or can a man walk on hot coalsAnd his feet not be scorched ?
20:6:029:0	So is the one who goes in to his neighbor’s wife ; Whoever touches her will not go unpunished .
20:6:030:0	Men do not despise a thief if he stealsTo satisfy himself when he is hungry ;
20:6:031:0	But when he is found , he must repay sevenfold ; He must give all the substance of his house .
20:6:032:0	The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense ; He who would destroy himself does it .
20:6:033:0	Wounds and disgrace he will find , And his reproach will not be blotted out .
20:6:034:0	For jealousy enrages a man , And he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
20:6:035:0	He will not accept any ransom , Nor will he be satisfied though you give many gifts .
