20:14:013:0	Even in laughter the heart may be in pain , And the end of joy may be grief .
20:14:014:0	The backslider in heart will have his fill of his own ways , But a good man will be satisfied with his .

20:14:021:0	He who despises his neighbor sins , But happy is he who is gracious to the poor .
20:14:022:0	Will they not go astray who devise evil ? But kindness and truth will be to those who devise good .

20:14:028:0	In a multitude of people is a king’s glory , But in the dearth of people is a prince’s ruin .
20:14:029:0	He who is slow to anger has great understanding , But he who is quick-tempered exalts folly .
20:14:030:0	A tranquil heart is life to the body , But passion is rottenness to the bones .
20:14:031:0	He who oppresses the poor taunts his Maker , But he who is gracious to the needy honors Him .
