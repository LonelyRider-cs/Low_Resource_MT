20:19:001:1	On Life and Conduct
20:19:001:0	Better is a poor man who walks in his integrityThan he who is perverse in speech and is a fool .
20:19:002:0	Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge , And he who hurries his footsteps errs .
20:19:003:0	The foolishness of man ruins his way , And his heart rages against the Lord .
20:19:004:0	Wealth adds many friends , But a poor man is separated from his friend .
20:19:005:0	A false witness will not go unpunished , And he who tells lies will not escape .
20:19:006:0	Many will seek the favor of a generous man , And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts .
20:19:007:0	All the brothers of a poor man hate him ; How much more do his friends abandon him ! He pursues them with words , but they are gone .
20:19:008:0	He who gets wisdom loves his own soul ; He who keeps understanding will find good .
20:19:009:0	A false witness will not go unpunished , And he who tells lies will perish .
20:19:010:0	Luxury is not fitting for a fool ; Much less for a slave to rule over princes .
20:19:011:0	A man’s discretion makes him slow to anger , And it is his glory to overlook a transgression .
20:19:012:0	The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion , But his favor is like dew on the grass .
20:19:013:0	A foolish son is destruction to his father , And the contentions of a wife are a constant dripping .
20:19:014:0	House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers , But a prudent wife is from the Lord .
20:19:015:0	Laziness casts into a deep sleep , And an idle man will suffer hunger .
20:19:016:0	He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul , But he who is careless of conduct will die .
20:19:017:0	One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the Lord , And He will repay him for his good deed .
20:19:018:0	Discipline your son while there is hope , And do not desire his death .
20:19:019:0	A man of great anger will bear the penalty , For if you rescue him , you will only have to do it again .
20:19:020:0	Listen to counsel and accept discipline , That you may be wise the rest of your days .
20:19:021:0	Many plans are in a man’s heart , But the counsel of the Lord will stand .
20:19:022:0	What is desirable in a man is his kindness , And it is better to be a poor man than a liar .
20:19:023:0	The fear of the Lord leads to life , So that one may sleep satisfied , untouched by evil .
20:19:024:0	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish , But will not even bring it back to his mouth .
20:19:025:0	Strike a scoffer and the naive may become shrewd , But reprove one who has understanding and he will gain knowledge .
20:19:026:0	He who assaults his father and drives his mother awayIs a shameful and disgraceful son .
20:19:027:0	Cease listening , my son , to discipline , And you will stray from the words of knowledge .
20:19:028:0	A rascally witness makes a mockery of justice , And the mouth of the wicked spreads iniquity .
20:19:029:0	Judgments are prepared for scoffers , And blows for the back of fools .
