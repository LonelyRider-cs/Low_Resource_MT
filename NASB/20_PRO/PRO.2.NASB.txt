20:2:001:1	The Pursuit of Wisdom Brings Security
20:2:001:0	My son , if you will receive my wordsAnd treasure my commandments within you ,
20:2:002:0	Make your ear attentive to wisdom , Incline your heart to understanding ;
20:2:003:0	For if you cry for discernment , Lift your voice for understanding ;
20:2:004:0	If you seek her as silverAnd search for her as for hidden treasures ;
20:2:005:0	Then you will discern the fear of the LordAnd discover the knowledge of God .
20:2:006:0	For the Lord gives wisdom ; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding .
20:2:007:0	He stores up sound wisdom for the upright ; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity ,
20:2:008:0	Guarding the paths of justice , And He preserves the way of His godly ones .
20:2:009:0	Then you will discern righteousness and justiceAnd equity and every good course .
20:2:010:0	For wisdom will enter your heartAnd knowledge will be pleasant to your soul ;
20:2:011:0	Discretion will guard you , Understanding will watch over you ,
20:2:012:0	To deliver you from the way of evil , From the man who speaks perverse things ;
20:2:013:0	From those who leave the paths of uprightnessTo walk in the ways of darkness ;
20:2:014:0	Who delight in doing evilAnd rejoice in the perversity of evil ;
20:2:015:0	Whose paths are crooked , And who are devious in their ways ;
20:2:016:0	To deliver you from the strange woman , From the adulteress who flatters with her words ;
20:2:017:0	That leaves the companion of her youthAnd forgets the covenant of her God ;
20:2:018:0	For her house sinks down to deathAnd her tracks lead to the dead ;
20:2:019:0	None who go to her return again , Nor do they reach the paths of life .
20:2:020:0	So you will walk in the way of good menAnd keep to the paths of the righteous .
20:2:021:0	For the upright will live in the landAnd the blameless will remain in it ;
20:2:022:0	But the wicked will be cut off from the landAnd the treacherous will be uprooted from it .
