20:31:001:1	The Words of Lemuel
20:31:001:0	The words of King Lemuel , the oracle which his mother taught him :
20:31:002:0	What , O my son ? And what , O son of my womb ? And what , O son of my vows ?
20:31:003:0	Do not give your strength to women , Or your ways to that which destroys kings .
20:31:004:0	It is not for kings , O Lemuel , It is not for kings to drink wine , Or for rulers to desire strong drink ,
20:31:005:0	For they will drink and forget what is decreed , And pervert the rights of all the afflicted .
20:31:006:0	Give strong drink to him who is perishing , And wine to him whose life is bitter .
20:31:007:0	Let him drink and forget his povertyAnd remember his trouble no more .
20:31:008:0	Open your mouth for the mute , For the rights of all the unfortunate .
20:31:002:1	Description of a Worthy Woman
20:31:009:0	Open your mouth , judge righteously , And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy .
20:31:010:0	An excellent wife , who can find ? For her worth is far above jewels .
20:31:011:0	The heart of her husband trusts in her , And he will have no lack of gain .
20:31:012:0	She does him good and not evilAll the days of her life .
20:31:013:0	She looks for wool and flaxAnd works with her hands in delight .
20:31:014:0	She is like merchant ships ; She brings her food from afar .
20:31:015:0	She rises also while it is still nightAnd gives food to her householdAnd portions to her maidens .
20:31:016:0	She considers a field and buys it ; From her earnings she plants a vineyard .
20:31:017:0	She girds herself with strengthAnd makes her arms strong .
20:31:018:0	She senses that her gain is good ; Her lamp does not go out at night .
20:31:019:0	She stretches out her hands to the distaff , And her hands grasp the spindle .
20:31:020:0	She extends her hand to the poor , And she stretches out her hands to the needy .
20:31:021:0	She is not afraid of the snow for her household , For all her household are clothed with scarlet .
20:31:022:0	She makes coverings for herself ; Her clothing is fine linen and purple .
20:31:023:0	Her husband is known in the gates , When he sits among the elders of the land .
20:31:024:0	She makes linen garments and sells them , And supplies belts to the tradesmen .
20:31:025:0	Strength and dignity are her clothing , And she smiles at the future .
20:31:026:0	She opens her mouth in wisdom , And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue .
20:31:027:0	She looks well to the ways of her household , And does not eat the bread of idleness .
20:31:028:0	Her children rise up and bless her ; Her husband also , and he praises her , saying :
20:31:029:0	“ Many daughters have done nobly , But you excel them all . ”
20:31:030:0	Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain , But a woman who fears the Lord , she shall be praised .
20:31:031:0	Give her the product of her hands , And let her works praise her in the gates .
