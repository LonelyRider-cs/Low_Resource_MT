20:22:001:1	On Life and Conduct
20:22:001:0	A good name is to be more desired than great wealth , Favor is better than silver and gold .
20:22:002:0	The rich and the poor have a common bond , The Lord is the maker of them all .
20:22:003:0	The prudent sees the evil and hides himself , But the naive go on , and are punished for it .
20:22:004:0	The reward of humility and the fear of the LordAre riches , honor and life .
20:22:005:0	Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse ; He who guards himself will be far from them .
20:22:006:0	Train up a child in the way he should go , Even when he is old he will not depart from it .
20:22:007:0	The rich rules over the poor , And the borrower becomes the lender’s slave .
20:22:008:0	He who sows iniquity will reap vanity , And the rod of his fury will perish .
20:22:009:0	He who is generous will be blessed , For he gives some of his food to the poor .
20:22:010:0	Drive out the scoffer , and contention will go out , Even strife and dishonor will cease .
20:22:011:0	He who loves purity of heart And whose speech is gracious , the king is his friend .
20:22:012:0	The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge , But He overthrows the words of the treacherous man .
20:22:013:0	The sluggard says , “ There is a lion outside ; I will be killed in the streets ! ”
20:22:014:0	The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit ; He who is cursed of the Lord will fall into it .
20:22:015:0	Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child ; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him .
20:22:016:0	He who oppresses the poor to make more for himselfOr who gives to the rich , will only come to poverty .
20:22:017:0	Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise , And apply your mind to my knowledge ;
20:22:018:0	For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you , That they may be ready on your lips .
20:22:019:0	So that your trust may be in the Lord , I have taught you today , even you .
20:22:020:0	Have I not written to you excellent thingsOf counsels and knowledge ,
20:22:021:0	To make you know the certainty of the words of truthThat you may correctly answer him who sent you ?
20:22:022:0	Do not rob the poor because he is poor , Or crush the afflicted at the gate ;
20:22:023:0	For the Lord will plead their caseAnd take the life of those who rob them .
20:22:024:0	Do not associate with a man given to anger ; Or go with a hot-tempered man ,
20:22:025:0	Or you will learn his waysAnd find a snare for yourself .
20:22:026:0	Do not be among those who give pledges , Among those who become guarantors for debts .
20:22:027:0	If you have nothing with which to pay , Why should he take your bed from under you ?
20:22:028:0	Do not move the ancient boundaryWhich your fathers have set .
20:22:029:0	Do you see a man skilled in his work ? He will stand before kings ; He will not stand before obscure men .
