20:1:001:1	The Usefulness of Proverbs
20:1:001:0	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel :
20:1:002:0	To know wisdom and instruction , To discern the sayings of understanding ,
20:1:003:0	To receive instruction in wise behavior , Righteousness , justice and equity ;
20:1:004:0	To give prudence to the naive , To the youth knowledge and discretion ,
20:1:005:0	A wise man will hear and increase in learning , And a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel ,
20:1:006:0	To understand a proverb and a figure , The words of the wise and their riddles .
20:1:002:1	The Enticement of Sinners
20:1:007:0	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge ; Fools despise wisdom and instruction .
20:1:008:0	Hear , my son , your father’s instructionAnd do not forsake your mother’s teaching ;
20:1:009:0	Indeed , they are a graceful wreath to your headAnd ornaments about your neck .
20:1:010:0	My son , if sinners entice you , Do not consent .
20:1:011:0	If they say , “ Come with us , Let us lie in wait for blood , Let us ambush the innocent without cause ;
20:1:012:0	Let us swallow them alive like Sheol , Even whole , as those who go down to the pit ;
20:1:013:0	We will find all kinds of precious wealth , We will fill our houses with spoil ;
20:1:014:0	Throw in your lot with us , We shall all have one purse , ”
20:1:015:0	My son , do not walk in the way with them . Keep your feet from their path ,
20:1:016:0	For their feet run to evilAnd they hasten to shed blood .
20:1:017:0	Indeed , it is useless to spread the baited netIn the sight of any bird ;
20:1:018:0	But they lie in wait for their own blood ; They ambush their own lives .
20:1:003:1	Wisdom Warns
20:1:019:0	So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence ; It takes away the life of its possessors .
20:1:020:0	Wisdom shouts in the street , She lifts her voice in the square ;
20:1:021:0	At the head of the noisy streets she cries out ; At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings :
20:1:022:0	“ How long , O naive ones , will you love being simple-minded ? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffingAnd fools hate knowledge ?
20:1:023:0	Turn to my reproof , Behold , I will pour out my spirit on you ; I will make my words known to you .
20:1:024:0	Because I called and you refused , I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention ;
20:1:025:0	And you neglected all my counselAnd did not want my reproof ;
20:1:026:0	I will also laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your dread comes ,
20:1:027:0	When your dread comes like a stormAnd your calamity comes like a whirlwind , When distress and anguish come upon you .
20:1:028:0	Then they will call on me , but I will not answer ; They will seek me diligently but they will not find me ,
20:1:029:0	Because they hated knowledgeAnd did not choose the fear of the Lord .
20:1:030:0	They would not accept my counsel , They spurned all my reproof .
20:1:031:0	So they shall eat of the fruit of their own wayAnd be satiated with their own devices .
20:1:032:0	For the waywardness of the naive will kill them , And the complacency of fools will destroy them .
20:1:033:0	But he who listens to me shall live securelyAnd will be at ease from the dread of evil . ”
