20:23:001:1	On Life and Conduct
20:23:001:0	When you sit down to dine with a ruler , Consider carefully what is before you ,
20:23:002:0	And put a knife to your throatIf you are a man of great appetite .
20:23:003:0	Do not desire his delicacies , For it is deceptive food .
20:23:004:0	Do not weary yourself to gain wealth , Cease from your consideration of it .
20:23:005:0	When you set your eyes on it , it is gone . For wealth certainly makes itself wingsLike an eagle that flies toward the heavens .
20:23:006:0	Do not eat the bread of a selfish man , Or desire his delicacies ;
20:23:007:0	For as he thinks within himself , so he is . He says to you , “ Eat and drink ! ” But his heart is not with you .
20:23:008:0	You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten , And waste your compliments .
20:23:009:0	Do not speak in the hearing of a fool , For he will despise the wisdom of your words .
20:23:010:0	Do not move the ancient boundaryOr go into the fields of the fatherless ,
20:23:011:0	For their Redeemer is strong ; He will plead their case against you .
20:23:012:0	Apply your heart to disciplineAnd your ears to words of knowledge .
20:23:013:0	Do not hold back discipline from the child , Although you strike him with the rod , he will not die .
20:23:014:0	You shall strike him with the rodAnd rescue his soul from Sheol .
20:23:015:0	My son , if your heart is wise , My own heart also will be glad ;
20:23:016:0	And my inmost being will rejoiceWhen your lips speak what is right .
20:23:017:0	Do not let your heart envy sinners , But live in the fear of the Lord always .
20:23:018:0	Surely there is a future , And your hope will not be cut off .
20:23:019:0	Listen , my son , and be wise , And direct your heart in the way .
20:23:020:0	Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine , Or with gluttonous eaters of meat ;
20:23:021:0	For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty , And drowsiness will clothe one with rags .
20:23:022:0	Listen to your father who begot you , And do not despise your mother when she is old .
20:23:023:0	Buy truth , and do not sell it , Get wisdom and instruction and understanding .
20:23:024:0	The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice , And he who sires a wise son will be glad in him .
20:23:025:0	Let your father and your mother be glad , And let her rejoice who gave birth to you .
20:23:026:0	Give me your heart , my son , And let your eyes delight in my ways .
20:23:027:0	For a harlot is a deep pitAnd an adulterous woman is a narrow well .
20:23:028:0	Surely she lurks as a robber , And increases the faithless among men .
20:23:029:0	Who has woe ? Who has sorrow ? Who has contentions ? Who has complaining ? Who has wounds without cause ? Who has redness of eyes ?
20:23:030:0	Those who linger long over wine , Those who go to taste mixed wine .
20:23:031:0	Do not look on the wine when it is red , When it sparkles in the cup , When it goes down smoothly ;
20:23:032:0	At the last it bites like a serpentAnd stings like a viper .
20:23:033:0	Your eyes will see strange thingsAnd your mind will utter perverse things .
20:23:034:0	And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea , Or like one who lies down on the top of a mast .
20:23:035:0	“ They struck me , but I did not become ill ; They beat me , but I did not know it . When shall I awake ? I will seek another drink . ”
