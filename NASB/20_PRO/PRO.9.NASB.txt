20:9:001:1	Wisdom’s Invitation
20:9:001:0	Wisdom has built her house , She has hewn out her seven pillars ;
20:9:002:0	She has prepared her food , she has mixed her wine ; She has also set her table ;
20:9:003:0	She has sent out her maidens , she callsFrom the tops of the heights of the city :
20:9:004:0	“ Whoever is naive , let him turn in here ! ” To him who lacks understanding she says ,
20:9:005:0	“ Come , eat of my foodAnd drink of the wine I have mixed .
20:9:006:0	Forsake your folly and live , And proceed in the way of understanding . ”
20:9:007:0	He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself , And he who reproves a wicked man gets insults for himself .
20:9:008:0	Do not reprove a scoffer , or he will hate you , Reprove a wise man and he will love you .
20:9:009:0	Give instruction to a wise man and he will be still wiser , Teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning .
20:9:010:0	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom , And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding .
20:9:011:0	For by me your days will be multiplied , And years of life will be added to you .
20:9:012:0	If you are wise , you are wise for yourself , And if you scoff , you alone will bear it .
20:9:013:0	The woman of folly is boisterous , She is naive and knows nothing .
20:9:014:0	She sits at the doorway of her house , On a seat by the high places of the city ,
20:9:015:0	Calling to those who pass by , Who are making their paths straight :
20:9:016:0	“ Whoever is naive , let him turn in here , ” And to him who lacks understanding she says ,
20:9:017:0	“ Stolen water is sweet ; And bread eaten in secret is pleasant . ”
20:9:018:0	But he does not know that the dead are there , That her guests are in the depths of Sheol .
