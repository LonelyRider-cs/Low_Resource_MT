20:13:001:1	Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
20:13:001:0	A wise son accepts his father’s discipline , But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke .
20:13:002:0	From the fruit of a man’s mouth he enjoys good , But the desire of the treacherous is violence .
20:13:003:0	The one who guards his mouth preserves his life ; The one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin .
20:13:004:0	The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing , But the soul of the diligent is made fat .
20:13:005:0	A righteous man hates falsehood , But a wicked man acts disgustingly and shamefully .
20:13:006:0	Righteousness guards the one whose way is blameless , But wickedness subverts the sinner .
20:13:007:0	There is one who pretends to be rich , but has nothing ; Another pretends to be poor , but has great wealth .
20:13:008:0	The ransom of a man’s life is his wealth , But the poor hears no rebuke .
20:13:009:0	The light of the righteous rejoices , But the lamp of the wicked goes out .
20:13:010:0	Through insolence comes nothing but strife , But wisdom is with those who receive counsel .
20:13:011:0	Wealth obtained by fraud dwindles , But the one who gathers by labor increases it .
20:13:012:0	Hope deferred makes the heart sick , But desire fulfilled is a tree of life .
20:13:013:0	The one who despises the word will be in debt to it , But the one who fears the commandment will be rewarded .
20:13:014:0	The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life , To turn aside from the snares of death .
20:13:015:0	Good understanding produces favor , But the way of the treacherous is hard .
20:13:016:0	Every prudent man acts with knowledge , But a fool displays folly .
20:13:017:0	A wicked messenger falls into adversity , But a faithful envoy brings healing .
20:13:018:0	Poverty and shame will come to him who neglects discipline , But he who regards reproof will be honored .
20:13:019:0	Desire realized is sweet to the soul , But it is an abomination to fools to turn away from evil .
20:13:020:0	He who walks with wise men will be wise , But the companion of fools will suffer harm .
20:13:021:0	Adversity pursues sinners , But the righteous will be rewarded with prosperity .
20:13:022:0	A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children , And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous .
20:13:023:0	Abundant food is in the fallow ground of the poor , But it is swept away by injustice .
20:13:024:0	He who withholds his rod hates his son , But he who loves him disciplines him diligently .
20:13:025:0	The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite , But the stomach of the wicked is in need .
