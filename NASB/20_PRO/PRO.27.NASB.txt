20:27:001:1	Warnings and Instructions
20:27:001:0	Do not boast about tomorrow , For you do not know what a day may bring forth .
20:27:002:0	Let another praise you , and not your own mouth ; A stranger , and not your own lips .
20:27:003:0	A stone is heavy and the sand weighty , But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them .
20:27:004:0	Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood , But who can stand before jealousy ?
20:27:005:0	Better is open rebukeThan love that is concealed .
20:27:006:0	Faithful are the wounds of a friend , But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy .
20:27:007:0	A sated man loathes honey , But to a famished man any bitter thing is sweet .
20:27:008:0	Like a bird that wanders from her nest , So is a man who wanders from his home .
20:27:009:0	Oil and perfume make the heart glad , So a man’s counsel is sweet to his friend .
20:27:010:0	Do not forsake your own friend or your father’s friend , And do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity ; Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away .
20:27:011:0	Be wise , my son , and make my heart glad , That I may reply to him who reproaches me .
20:27:012:0	A prudent man sees evil and hides himself , The naive proceed and pay the penalty .
20:27:013:0	Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger ; And for an adulterous woman hold him in pledge .
20:27:014:0	He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning , It will be reckoned a curse to him .
20:27:015:0	A constant dripping on a day of steady rainAnd a contentious woman are alike ;
20:27:016:0	He who would restrain her restrains the wind , And grasps oil with his right hand .
20:27:017:0	Iron sharpens iron , So one man sharpens another .
20:27:018:0	He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit , And he who cares for his master will be honored .
20:27:019:0	As in water face reflects face , So the heart of man reflects man .
20:27:020:0	Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied , Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied .
20:27:021:0	The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold , And each is tested by the praise accorded him .
20:27:022:0	Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain , Yet his foolishness will not depart from him .
20:27:023:0	Know well the condition of your flocks , And pay attention to your herds ;
20:27:024:0	For riches are not forever , Nor does a crown endure to all generations .
20:27:025:0	When the grass disappears , the new growth is seen , And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in ,
20:27:026:0	The lambs will be for your clothing , And the goats will bring the price of a field ,
20:27:027:0	And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food , For the food of your household , And sustenance for your maidens .
