20:5:001:1	Pitfalls of Immorality
20:5:001:0	My son , give attention to my wisdom , Incline your ear to my understanding ;
20:5:002:0	That you may observe discretionAnd your lips may reserve knowledge .
20:5:003:0	For the lips of an adulteress drip honeyAnd smoother than oil is her speech ;
20:5:004:0	But in the end she is bitter as wormwood , Sharp as a two-edged sword .
20:5:005:0	Her feet go down to death , Her steps take hold of Sheol .
20:5:006:0	She does not ponder the path of life ; Her ways are unstable , she does not know it .
20:5:007:0	Now then , my sons , listen to meAnd do not depart from the words of my mouth .
20:5:008:0	Keep your way far from herAnd do not go near the door of her house ,
20:5:009:0	Or you will give your vigor to othersAnd your years to the cruel one ;
20:5:010:0	And strangers will be filled with your strengthAnd your hard-earned goods will go to the house of an alien ;
20:5:011:0	And you groan at your final end , When your flesh and your body are consumed ;
20:5:012:0	And you say , “ How I have hated instruction ! And my heart spurned reproof !
20:5:013:0	I have not listened to the voice of my teachers , Nor inclined my ear to my instructors !
20:5:014:0	I was almost in utter ruinIn the midst of the assembly and congregation . ”
20:5:015:0	Drink water from your own cisternAnd fresh water from your own well .
20:5:016:0	Should your springs be dispersed abroad , Streams of water in the streets ?
20:5:017:0	Let them be yours aloneAnd not for strangers with you .
20:5:018:0	Let your fountain be blessed , And rejoice in the wife of your youth .
20:5:019:0	As a loving hind and a graceful doe , Let her breasts satisfy you at all times ; Be exhilarated always with her love .
20:5:020:0	For why should you , my son , be exhilarated with an adulteressAnd embrace the bosom of a foreigner ?
20:5:021:0	For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the Lord , And He watches all his paths .
20:5:022:0	His own iniquities will capture the wicked , And he will be held with the cords of his sin .
20:5:023:0	He will die for lack of instruction , And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray .
