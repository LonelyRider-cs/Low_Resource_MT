20:11:001:1	Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
20:11:001:0	A false balance is an abomination to the Lord , But a just weight is His delight .
20:11:002:0	When pride comes , then comes dishonor , But with the humble is wisdom .
20:11:003:0	The integrity of the upright will guide them , But the crookedness of the treacherous will destroy them .
20:11:004:0	Riches do not profit in the day of wrath , But righteousness delivers from death .
20:11:005:0	The righteousness of the blameless will smooth his way , But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness .
20:11:006:0	The righteousness of the upright will deliver them , But the treacherous will be caught by their own greed .
20:11:007:0	When a wicked man dies , his expectation will perish , And the hope of strong men perishes .
20:11:008:0	The righteous is delivered from trouble , But the wicked takes his place .
20:11:009:0	With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor , But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered .
20:11:010:0	When it goes well with the righteous , the city rejoices , And when the wicked perish , there is joyful shouting .
20:11:011:0	By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted , But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down .
20:11:012:0	He who despises his neighbor lacks sense , But a man of understanding keeps silent .
20:11:013:0	He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets , But he who is trustworthy conceals a matter .
20:11:014:0	Where there is no guidance the people fall , But in abundance of counselors there is victory .
20:11:015:0	He who is guarantor for a stranger will surely suffer for it , But he who hates being a guarantor is secure .
20:11:016:0	A gracious woman attains honor , And ruthless men attain riches .
20:11:017:0	The merciful man does himself good , But the cruel man does himself harm .
20:11:018:0	The wicked earns deceptive wages , But he who sows righteousness gets a true reward .
20:11:019:0	He who is steadfast in righteousness will attain to life , And he who pursues evil will bring about his own death .
20:11:020:0	The perverse in heart are an abomination to the Lord , But the blameless in their walk are His delight .
20:11:021:0	Assuredly , the evil man will not go unpunished , But the descendants of the righteous will be delivered .
20:11:022:0	As a ring of gold in a swineâ€™s snout So is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion .
20:11:023:0	The desire of the righteous is only good , But the expectation of the wicked is wrath .
20:11:024:0	There is one who scatters , and yet increases all the more , And there is one who withholds what is justly due , and yet it results only in want .
20:11:025:0	The generous man will be prosperous , And he who waters will himself be watered .
20:11:026:0	He who withholds grain , the people will curse him , But blessing will be on the head of him who sells it .
20:11:027:0	He who diligently seeks good seeks favor , But he who seeks evil , evil will come to him .
20:11:028:0	He who trusts in his riches will fall , But the righteous will flourish like the green leaf .
20:11:029:0	He who troubles his own house will inherit wind , And the foolish will be servant to the wisehearted .
20:11:030:0	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life , And he who is wise wins souls .
20:11:031:0	If the righteous will be rewarded in the earth , How much more the wicked and the sinner !
