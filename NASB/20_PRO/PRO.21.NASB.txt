20:21:001:1	On Life and Conduct
20:21:001:0	The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord ; He turns it wherever He wishes .
20:21:002:0	Every man’s way is right in his own eyes , But the Lord weighs the hearts .
20:21:003:0	To do righteousness and justiceIs desired by the Lord more than sacrifice .
20:21:004:0	Haughty eyes and a proud heart , The lamp of the wicked , is sin .
20:21:005:0	The plans of the diligent lead surely to advantage , But everyone who is hasty comes surely to poverty .
20:21:006:0	The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongueIs a fleeting vapor , the pursuit of death .
20:21:007:0	The violence of the wicked will drag them away , Because they refuse to act with justice .
20:21:008:0	The way of a guilty man is crooked , But as for the pure , his conduct is upright .
20:21:009:0	It is better to live in a corner of a roofThan in a house shared with a contentious woman .
20:21:010:0	The soul of the wicked desires evil ; His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes .
20:21:011:0	When the scoffer is punished , the naive becomes wise ; But when the wise is instructed , he receives knowledge .
20:21:012:0	The righteous one considers the house of the wicked , Turning the wicked to ruin .
20:21:013:0	He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poorWill also cry himself and not be answered .
20:21:014:0	A gift in secret subdues anger , And a bribe in the bosom , strong wrath .
20:21:015:0	The exercise of justice is joy for the righteous , But is terror to the workers of iniquity .
20:21:016:0	A man who wanders from the way of understandingWill rest in the assembly of the dead .
20:21:017:0	He who loves pleasure will become a poor man ; He who loves wine and oil will not become rich .
20:21:018:0	The wicked is a ransom for the righteous , And the treacherous is in the place of the upright .
20:21:019:0	It is better to live in a desert landThan with a contentious and vexing woman .
20:21:020:0	There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise , But a foolish man swallows it up .
20:21:021:0	He who pursues righteousness and loyaltyFinds life , righteousness and honor .
20:21:022:0	A wise man scales the city of the mightyAnd brings down the stronghold in which they trust .
20:21:023:0	He who guards his mouth and his tongue , Guards his soul from troubles .
20:21:024:0	“ Proud , ” “ Haughty , ” “ Scoffer , ” are his names , Who acts with insolent pride .
20:21:025:0	The desire of the sluggard puts him to death , For his hands refuse to work ;
20:21:026:0	All day long he is craving , While the righteous gives and does not hold back .
20:21:027:0	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination , How much more when he brings it with evil intent !
20:21:028:0	A false witness will perish , But the man who listens to the truth will speak forever .
20:21:029:0	A wicked man displays a bold face , But as for the upright , he makes his way sure .
20:21:030:0	There is no wisdom and no understandingAnd no counsel against the Lord .
20:21:031:0	The horse is prepared for the day of battle , But victory belongs to the Lord .
