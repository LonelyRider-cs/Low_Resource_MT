19:39:001:1	PSALM 39
19:39:002:1	The Vanity of Life .
19:39:003:1	For the choir director , for Jeduthun . A Psalm of David .
19:39:001:0	I said , “ I will guard my waysThat I may not sin with my tongue ; I will guard my mouth as with a muzzleWhile the wicked are in my presence . ”
19:39:002:0	I was mute and silent , I refrained even from good , And my sorrow grew worse .
19:39:003:0	My heart was hot within me , While I was musing the fire burned ; Then I spoke with my tongue :
19:39:004:0	“ Lord , make me to know my endAnd what is the extent of my days ; Let me know how transient I am .
19:39:005:0	Behold , You have made my days as handbreadths , And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight ; Surely every man at his best is a mere breath . Selah .
19:39:006:0	Surely every man walks about as a phantom ; Surely they make an uproar for nothing ; He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them .
19:39:007:0	“ And now , Lord , for what do I wait ? My hope is in You .
19:39:008:0	Deliver me from all my transgressions ; Make me not the reproach of the foolish .
19:39:009:0	I have become mute , I do not open my mouth , Because it is You who have done it .
19:39:010:0	Remove Your plague from me ; Because of the opposition of Your hand I am perishing .
19:39:011:0	With reproofs You chasten a man for iniquity ; You consume as a moth what is precious to him ; Surely every man is a mere breath . Selah .
19:39:012:0	“ Hear my prayer , O Lord , and give ear to my cry ; Do not be silent at my tears ; For I am a stranger with You , A sojourner like all my fathers .
19:39:013:0	Turn Your gaze away from me , that I may smile againBefore I depart and am no more . ”
