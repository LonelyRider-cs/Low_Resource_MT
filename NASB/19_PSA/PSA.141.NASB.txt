19:141:001:1	PSALM 141
19:141:002:1	An Evening Prayer for Sanctification and Protection .
19:141:003:1	A Psalm of David .
19:141:001:0	O Lord , I call upon You ; hasten to me ! Give ear to my voice when I call to You !
19:141:002:0	May my prayer be counted as incense before You ; The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering .
19:141:003:0	Set a guard , O Lord , over my mouth ; Keep watch over the door of my lips .
19:141:004:0	Do not incline my heart to any evil thing , To practice deeds of wickednessWith men who do iniquity ; And do not let me eat of their delicacies .
19:141:005:0	Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me ; It is oil upon the head ; Do not let my head refuse it , For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds .
19:141:006:0	Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock , And they hear my words , for they are pleasant .
19:141:007:0	As when one plows and breaks open the earth , Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol .
19:141:008:0	For my eyes are toward You , O God , the Lord ; In You I take refuge ; do not leave me defenseless .
19:141:009:0	Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me , And from the snares of those who do iniquity .
19:141:010:0	Let the wicked fall into their own nets , While I pass by safely .
