19:14:001:1	PSALM 14
19:14:002:1	Folly and Wickedness of Men .
19:14:003:1	For the choir director .
19:14:004:1	A Psalm
19:14:005:1	of David .
19:14:001:0	The fool has said in his heart , “ There is no God . ” They are corrupt , they have committed abominable deeds ; There is no one who does good .
19:14:002:0	The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of menTo see if there are any who understand , Who seek after God .
19:14:003:0	They have all turned aside , together they have become corrupt ; There is no one who does good , not even one .
19:14:004:0	Do all the workers of wickedness not know , Who eat up my people as they eat bread , And do not call upon the Lord ?
19:14:005:0	There they are in great dread , For God is with the righteous generation .
19:14:006:0	You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted , But the Lord is his refuge .
19:14:007:0	Oh , that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! When the Lord restores His captive people , Jacob will rejoice , Israel will be glad .
