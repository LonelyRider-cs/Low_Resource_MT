19:33:001:1	PSALM 33
19:33:002:1	Praise to the Creator and Preserver .
19:33:001:0	Sing for joy in the Lord , O you righteous ones ; Praise is becoming to the upright .
19:33:002:0	Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre ; Sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings .
19:33:003:0	Sing to Him a new song ; Play skillfully with a shout of joy .
19:33:004:0	For the word of the Lord is upright , And all His work is done in faithfulness .
19:33:005:0	He loves righteousness and justice ; The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the Lord .
19:33:006:0	By the word of the Lord the heavens were made , And by the breath of His mouth all their host .
19:33:007:0	He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap ; He lays up the deeps in storehouses .
19:33:008:0	Let all the earth fear the Lord ; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him .
19:33:009:0	For He spoke , and it was done ; He commanded , and it stood fast .
19:33:010:0	The Lord nullifies the counsel of the nations ; He frustrates the plans of the peoples .
19:33:011:0	The counsel of the Lord stands forever , The plans of His heart from generation to generation .
19:33:012:0	Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord , The people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance .
19:33:013:0	The Lord looks from heaven ; He sees all the sons of men ;
19:33:014:0	From His dwelling place He looks outOn all the inhabitants of the earth ,
19:33:015:0	He who fashions the hearts of them all , He who understands all their works .
19:33:016:0	The king is not saved by a mighty army ; A warrior is not delivered by great strength .
19:33:017:0	A horse is a false hope for victory ; Nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength .
19:33:018:0	Behold , the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him , On those who hope for His lovingkindness ,
19:33:019:0	To deliver their soul from deathAnd to keep them alive in famine .
19:33:020:0	Our soul waits for the Lord ; He is our help and our shield .
19:33:021:0	For our heart rejoices in Him , Because we trust in His holy name .
19:33:022:0	Let Your lovingkindness , O Lord , be upon us , According as we have hoped in You .
