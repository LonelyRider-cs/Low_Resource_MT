19:40:001:1	PSALM 40
19:40:002:1	God Sustains His Servant .
19:40:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:40:001:0	I waited patiently for the Lord ; And He inclined to me and heard my cry .
19:40:002:0	He brought me up out of the pit of destruction , out of the miry clay , And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm .
19:40:003:0	He put a new song in my mouth , a song of praise to our God ; Many will see and fearAnd will trust in the Lord .
19:40:004:0	How blessed is the man who has made the Lord his trust , And has not turned to the proud , nor to those who lapse into falsehood .
19:40:005:0	Many , O Lord my God , are the wonders which You have done , And Your thoughts toward us ; There is none to compare with You . If I would declare and speak of them , They would be too numerous to count .
19:40:006:0	Sacrifice and meal offering You have not desired ; My ears You have opened ; Burnt offering and sin offering You have not required .
19:40:007:0	Then I said , “ Behold , I come ; In the scroll of the book it is written of me .
19:40:008:0	I delight to do Your will , O my God ; Your Law is within my heart . ”
19:40:009:0	I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great congregation ; Behold , I will not restrain my lips , O Lord , You know .
19:40:010:0	I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart ; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation ; I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great congregation .
19:40:011:0	You , O Lord , will not withhold Your compassion from me ; Your lovingkindness and Your truth will continually preserve me .
19:40:012:0	For evils beyond number have surrounded me ; My iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to see ; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head , And my heart has failed me .
19:40:013:0	Be pleased , O Lord , to deliver me ; Make haste , O Lord , to help me .
19:40:014:0	Let those be ashamed and humiliated togetherWho seek my life to destroy it ; Let those be turned back and dishonoredWho delight in my hurt .
19:40:015:0	Let those be appalled because of their shameWho say to me , “ Aha , aha ! ”
19:40:016:0	Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You ; Let those who love Your salvation say continually , “ The Lord be magnified ! ”
19:40:017:0	Since I am afflicted and needy , Let the Lord be mindful of me . You are my help and my deliverer ; Do not delay , O my God .
