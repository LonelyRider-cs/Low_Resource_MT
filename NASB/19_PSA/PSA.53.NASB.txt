19:53:001:1	PSALM 53
19:53:002:1	Folly and Wickedness of Men .
19:53:003:1	For the choir director ; according to
19:53:004:1	I . e . sickness , a sad tone
19:53:005:1	Mahalath . A Maskil of David .
19:53:001:0	The fool has said in his heart , “ There is no God , ” They are corrupt , and have committed abominable injustice ; There is no one who does good .
19:53:002:0	God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of menTo see if there is anyone who understands , Who seeks after God .
19:53:003:0	Every one of them has turned aside ; together they have become corrupt ; There is no one who does good , not even one .
19:53:004:0	Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge , Who eat up My people as though they ate breadAnd have not called upon God ?
19:53:005:0	There they were in great fear where no fear had been ; For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you ; You put them to shame , because God had rejected them .
19:53:006:0	Oh , that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! When God restores His captive people , Let Jacob rejoice , let Israel be glad .
