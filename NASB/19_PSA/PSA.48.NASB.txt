19:48:001:1	PSALM 48
19:48:002:1	The Beauty and Glory of Zion .
19:48:003:1	A Song ; a Psalm of the sons of Korah .
19:48:001:0	Great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised , In the city of our God , His holy mountain .
19:48:002:0	Beautiful in elevation , the joy of the whole earth , Is Mount Zion in the far north , The city of the great King .
19:48:003:0	God , in her palaces , Has made Himself known as a stronghold .
19:48:004:0	For , lo , the kings assembled themselves , They passed by together .
19:48:005:0	They saw it , then they were amazed ; They were terrified , they fled in alarm .
19:48:006:0	Panic seized them there , Anguish , as of a woman in childbirth .
19:48:007:0	With the east windYou break the ships of Tarshish .
19:48:008:0	As we have heard , so have we seenIn the city of the Lord of hosts , in the city of our God ; God will establish her forever . Selah .
19:48:009:0	We have thought on Your lovingkindness , O God , In the midst of Your temple .
19:48:010:0	As is Your name , O God , So is Your praise to the ends of the earth ; Your right hand is full of righteousness .
19:48:011:0	Let Mount Zion be glad , Let the daughters of Judah rejoiceBecause of Your judgments .
19:48:012:0	Walk about Zion and go around her ; Count her towers ;
19:48:013:0	Consider her ramparts ; Go through her palaces , That you may tell it to the next generation .
19:48:014:0	For such is God , Our God forever and ever ; He will guide us until death .
