19:55:001:1	PSALM 55
19:55:002:1	Prayer for the Destruction of the Treacherous .
19:55:003:1	For the choir director ; on stringed instruments . A Maskil of David .
19:55:001:0	Give ear to my prayer , O God ; And do not hide Yourself from my supplication .
19:55:002:0	Give heed to me and answer me ; I am restless in my complaint and am surely distracted ,
19:55:003:0	Because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the pressure of the wicked ; For they bring down trouble upon meAnd in anger they bear a grudge against me .
19:55:004:0	My heart is in anguish within me , And the terrors of death have fallen upon me .
19:55:005:0	Fear and trembling come upon me , And horror has overwhelmed me .
19:55:006:0	I said , “ Oh , that I had wings like a dove ! I would fly away and be at rest .
19:55:007:0	Behold , I would wander far away , I would lodge in the wilderness . Selah .
19:55:008:0	I would hasten to my place of refugeFrom the stormy wind and tempest . ”
19:55:009:0	Confuse , O Lord , divide their tongues , For I have seen violence and strife in the city .
19:55:010:0	Day and night they go around her upon her walls , And iniquity and mischief are in her midst .
19:55:011:0	Destruction is in her midst ; Oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets .
19:55:012:0	For it is not an enemy who reproaches me , Then I could bear it ; Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me , Then I could hide myself from him .
19:55:013:0	But it is you , a man my equal , My companion and my familiar friend ;
19:55:014:0	We who had sweet fellowship togetherWalked in the house of God in the throng .
19:55:015:0	Let death come deceitfully upon them ; Let them go down alive to Sheol , For evil is in their dwelling , in their midst .
19:55:016:0	As for me , I shall call upon God , And the Lord will save me .
19:55:017:0	Evening and morning and at noon , I will complain and murmur , And He will hear my voice .
19:55:018:0	He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle which is against me , For they are many who strive with me .
19:55:019:0	God will hear and answer them—Even the one who sits enthroned from of old— Selah . With whom there is no change , And who do not fear God .
19:55:020:0	He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him ; He has violated his covenant .
19:55:021:0	His speech was smoother than butter , But his heart was war ; His words were softer than oil , Yet they were drawn swords .
19:55:022:0	Cast your burden upon the Lord and He will sustain you ; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken .
19:55:023:0	But You , O God , will bring them down to the pit of destruction ; Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days . But I will trust in You .
