19:137:001:1	PSALM 137
19:137:002:1	An Experience of the Captivity .
19:137:001:0	By the rivers of Babylon , There we sat down and wept , When we remembered Zion .
19:137:002:0	Upon the willows in the midst of itWe hung our harps .
19:137:003:0	For there our captors demanded of us songs , And our tormentors mirth , saying , “ Sing us one of the songs of Zion . ”
19:137:004:0	How can we sing the Lord’s songIn a foreign land ?
19:137:005:0	If I forget you , O Jerusalem , May my right hand forget her skill .
19:137:006:0	May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouthIf I do not remember you , If I do not exalt JerusalemAbove my chief joy .
19:137:007:0	Remember , O Lord , against the sons of EdomThe day of Jerusalem , Who said , “ Raze it , raze itTo its very foundation . ”
19:137:008:0	O daughter of Babylon , you devastated one , How blessed will be the one who repays youWith the recompense with which you have repaid us .
19:137:009:0	How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little onesAgainst the rock .
