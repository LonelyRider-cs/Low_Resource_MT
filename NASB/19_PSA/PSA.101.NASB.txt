19:101:001:1	PSALM 101
19:101:002:1	The Psalmistâ€™s Profession of Uprightness .
19:101:003:1	A Psalm of David .
19:101:001:0	I will sing of lovingkindness and justice , To You , O Lord , I will sing praises .
19:101:002:0	I will give heed to the blameless way . When will You come to me ? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart .
19:101:003:0	I will set no worthless thing before my eyes ; I hate the work of those who fall away ; It shall not fasten its grip on me .
19:101:004:0	A perverse heart shall depart from me ; I will know no evil .
19:101:005:0	Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor , him I will destroy ; No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure .
19:101:006:0	My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me ; He who walks in a blameless way is the one who will minister to me .
19:101:007:0	He who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house ; He who speaks falsehood shall not maintain his position before me .
19:101:008:0	Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land , So as to cut off from the city of the Lord all those who do iniquity .
