19:16:010:1	Mikhtam of David .
19:16:001:0	Preserve me , O God , for I take refuge in You .
19:16:002:0	I said to the Lord , “ You are my Lord ; I have no good besides You . ”
19:16:003:0	As for the saints who are in the earth , They are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight .
19:16:004:0	The sorrows of those who have bartered for another god will be multiplied ; I shall not pour out their drink offerings of blood , Nor will I take their names upon my lips .
19:16:005:0	The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup ; You support my lot .
19:16:006:0	The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places ; Indeed , my heritage is beautiful to me .
19:16:007:0	I will bless the Lord who has counseled me ; Indeed , my mind instructs me in the night .
19:16:008:0	I have set the Lord continually before me ; Because He is at my right hand , I will not be shaken .
19:16:009:0	Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices ; My flesh also will dwell securely .
19:16:010:0	For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol ; Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay .
19:16:011:0	You will make known to me the path of life ; In Your presence is fullness of joy ; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever .
