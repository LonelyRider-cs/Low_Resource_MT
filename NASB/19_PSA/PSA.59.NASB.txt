19:59:001:1	PSALM 59
19:59:002:1	Prayer for Deliverance from Enemies .
19:59:003:1	For the choir director ;
19:59:004:1	set to
19:59:005:1	Al-tashheth . A Mikhtam of David , when Saul sent
19:59:006:1	men
19:59:007:1	and they watched the house in order to kill him .
19:59:001:0	Deliver me from my enemies , O my God ; Set me securely on high away from those who rise up against me .
19:59:002:0	Deliver me from those who do iniquityAnd save me from men of bloodshed .
19:59:003:0	For behold , they have set an ambush for my life ; Fierce men launch an attack against me , Not for my transgression nor for my sin , O Lord ,
19:59:004:0	For no guilt of mine , they run and set themselves against me . Arouse Yourself to help me , and see !
19:59:005:0	You , O Lord God of hosts , the God of Israel , Awake to punish all the nations ; Do not be gracious to any who are treacherous in iniquity . Selah .
19:59:006:0	They return at evening , they howl like a dog , And go around the city .
19:59:007:0	Behold , they belch forth with their mouth ; Swords are in their lips , For , they say , “ Who hears ? ”
19:59:008:0	But You , O Lord , laugh at them ; You scoff at all the nations .
19:59:009:0	Because of his strength I will watch for You , For God is my stronghold .
19:59:010:0	My God in His lovingkindness will meet me ; God will let me look triumphantly upon my foes .
19:59:011:0	Do not slay them , or my people will forget ; Scatter them by Your power , and bring them down , O Lord , our shield .
19:59:012:0	On account of the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips , Let them even be caught in their pride , And on account of curses and lies which they utter .
19:59:013:0	Destroy them in wrath , destroy them that they may be no more ; That men may know that God rules in JacobTo the ends of the earth . Selah .
19:59:014:0	They return at evening , they howl like a dog , And go around the city .
19:59:015:0	They wander about for foodAnd growl if they are not satisfied .
19:59:016:0	But as for me , I shall sing of Your strength ; Yes , I shall joyfully sing of Your lovingkindness in the morning , For You have been my strongholdAnd a refuge in the day of my distress .
19:59:017:0	O my strength , I will sing praises to You ; For God is my stronghold , the God who shows me lovingkindness .
