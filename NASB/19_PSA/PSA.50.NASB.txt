19:50:001:1	PSALM 50
19:50:002:1	God the Judge of the Righteous and the Wicked .
19:50:003:1	A Psalm of Asaph .
19:50:001:0	The Mighty One , God , the Lord , has spoken , And summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting .
19:50:002:0	Out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God has shone forth .
19:50:003:0	May our God come and not keep silence ; Fire devours before Him , And it is very tempestuous around Him .
19:50:004:0	He summons the heavens above , And the earth , to judge His people :
19:50:005:0	“ Gather My godly ones to Me , Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice . ”
19:50:006:0	And the heavens declare His righteousness , For God Himself is judge . Selah .
19:50:007:0	“ Hear , O My people , and I will speak ; O Israel , I will testify against you ; I am God , your God .
19:50:008:0	I do not reprove you for your sacrifices , And your burnt offerings are continually before Me .
19:50:009:0	I shall take no young bull out of your houseNor male goats out of your folds .
19:50:010:0	For every beast of the forest is Mine , The cattle on a thousand hills .
19:50:011:0	I know every bird of the mountains , And everything that moves in the field is Mine .
19:50:012:0	If I were hungry I would not tell you , For the world is Mine , and all it contains .
19:50:013:0	Shall I eat the flesh of bullsOr drink the blood of male goats ?
19:50:014:0	Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgivingAnd pay your vows to the Most High ;
19:50:015:0	Call upon Me in the day of trouble ; I shall rescue you , and you will honor Me . ”
19:50:016:0	But to the wicked God says , “ What right have you to tell of My statutesAnd to take My covenant in your mouth ?
19:50:017:0	For you hate discipline , And you cast My words behind you .
19:50:018:0	When you see a thief , you are pleased with him , And you associate with adulterers .
19:50:019:0	You let your mouth loose in evilAnd your tongue frames deceit .
19:50:020:0	You sit and speak against your brother ; You slander your own mother’s son .
19:50:021:0	These things you have done and I kept silence ; You thought that I was just like you ; I will reprove you and state the case in order before your eyes .
19:50:022:0	“ Now consider this , you who forget God , Or I will tear you in pieces , and there will be none to deliver .
19:50:023:0	He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me ; And to him who orders his way arightI shall show the salvation of God . ”
