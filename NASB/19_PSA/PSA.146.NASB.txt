19:146:003:1	ord
19:146:004:1	an Abundant Helper .
19:146:001:0	Praise the Lord ! Praise the Lord , O my soul !
19:146:002:0	I will praise the Lord while I live ; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being .
19:146:003:0	Do not trust in princes , In mortal man , in whom there is no salvation .
19:146:004:0	His spirit departs , he returns to the earth ; In that very day his thoughts perish .
19:146:005:0	How blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob , Whose hope is in the Lord his God ,
19:146:006:0	Who made heaven and earth , The sea and all that is in them ; Who keeps faith forever ;
19:146:007:0	Who executes justice for the oppressed ; Who gives food to the hungry . The Lord sets the prisoners free .
19:146:008:0	The Lord opens the eyes of the blind ; The Lord raises up those who are bowed down ; The Lord loves the righteous ;
19:146:009:0	The Lord protects the strangers ; He supports the fatherless and the widow , But He thwarts the way of the wicked .
19:146:010:0	The Lord will reign forever , Your God , O Zion , to all generations . Praise the Lord !
