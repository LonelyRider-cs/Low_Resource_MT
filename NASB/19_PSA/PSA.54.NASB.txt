19:54:001:1	PSALM 54
19:54:002:1	Prayer for Defense against Enemies .
19:54:003:1	For the choir director ; on stringed instruments . A Maskil of David , when the Ziphites came and said to Saul , “ Is not David hiding himself among us ? ”
19:54:001:0	Save me , O God , by Your name , And vindicate me by Your power .
19:54:002:0	Hear my prayer , O God ; Give ear to the words of my mouth .
19:54:003:0	For strangers have risen against meAnd violent men have sought my life ; They have not set God before them . Selah .
19:54:004:0	Behold , God is my helper ; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul .
19:54:005:0	He will recompense the evil to my foes ; Destroy them in Your faithfulness .
19:54:006:0	Willingly I will sacrifice to You ; I will give thanks to Your name , O Lord , for it is good .
19:54:007:0	For He has delivered me from all trouble , And my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies .
