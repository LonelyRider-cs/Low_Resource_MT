19:19:001:1	PSALM 19
19:19:002:1	The Works and the Word of God .
19:19:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:19:001:0	The heavens are telling of the glory of God ; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands .
19:19:002:0	Day to day pours forth speech , And night to night reveals knowledge .
19:19:003:0	There is no speech , nor are there words ; Their voice is not heard .
19:19:004:0	Their line has gone out through all the earth , And their utterances to the end of the world . In them He has placed a tent for the sun ,
19:19:005:0	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber ; It rejoices as a strong man to run his course .
19:19:006:0	Its rising is from one end of the heavens , And its circuit to the other end of them ; And there is nothing hidden from its heat .
19:19:007:0	The law of the Lord is perfect , restoring the soul ; The testimony of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple .
19:19:008:0	The precepts of the Lord are right , rejoicing the heart ; The commandment of the Lord is pure , enlightening the eyes .
19:19:009:0	The fear of the Lord is clean , enduring forever ; The judgments of the Lord are true ; they are righteous altogether .
19:19:010:0	They are more desirable than gold , yes , than much fine gold ; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb .
19:19:011:0	Moreover , by them Your servant is warned ; In keeping them there is great reward .
19:19:012:0	Who can discern his errors ? Acquit me of hidden faults .
19:19:013:0	Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins ; Let them not rule over me ; Then I will be blameless , And I shall be acquitted of great transgression .
19:19:014:0	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heartBe acceptable in Your sight , O Lord , my rock and my Redeemer .
