19:36:001:1	PSALM 36
19:36:002:1	Wickedness of Men and Lovingkindness of God .
19:36:003:1	For the choir director .
19:36:004:1	A Psalm
19:36:005:1	of David the servant of the L
19:36:006:1	ord
19:36:007:1	.
19:36:001:0	Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart ; There is no fear of God before his eyes .
19:36:002:0	For it flatters him in his own eyesConcerning the discovery of his iniquity and the hatred of it .
19:36:003:0	The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit ; He has ceased to be wise and to do good .
19:36:004:0	He plans wickedness upon his bed ; He sets himself on a path that is not good ; He does not despise evil .
19:36:005:0	Your lovingkindness , O Lord , extends to the heavens , Your faithfulness reaches to the skies .
19:36:006:0	Your righteousness is like the mountains of God ; Your judgments are like a great deep . O Lord , You preserve man and beast .
19:36:007:0	How precious is Your lovingkindness , O God ! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings .
19:36:008:0	They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house ; And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights .
19:36:009:0	For with You is the fountain of life ; In Your light we see light .
19:36:010:0	O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You , And Your righteousness to the upright in heart .
19:36:011:0	Let not the foot of pride come upon me , And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away .
19:36:012:0	There the doers of iniquity have fallen ; They have been thrust down and cannot rise .
