19:15:001:1	PSALM 15
19:15:002:1	Description of a Citizen of Zion .
19:15:003:1	A Psalm of David .
19:15:001:0	O Lord , who may abide in Your tent ? Who may dwell on Your holy hill ?
19:15:002:0	He who walks with integrity , and works righteousness , And speaks truth in his heart .
19:15:003:0	He does not slander with his tongue , Nor does evil to his neighbor , Nor takes up a reproach against his friend ;
19:15:004:0	In whose eyes a reprobate is despised , But who honors those who fear the Lord ; He swears to his own hurt and does not change ;
19:15:005:0	He does not put out his money at interest , Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent . He who does these things will never be shaken .
