19:2:004:1	’
19:2:005:1	s
19:2:006:1	Anointed .
19:2:001:0	Why are the nations in an uproarAnd the peoples devising a vain thing ?
19:2:002:0	The kings of the earth take their standAnd the rulers take counsel togetherAgainst the Lord and against His Anointed , saying ,
19:2:003:0	“ Let us tear their fetters apartAnd cast away their cords from us ! ”
19:2:004:0	He who sits in the heavens laughs , The Lord scoffs at them .
19:2:005:0	Then He will speak to them in His angerAnd terrify them in His fury , saying ,
19:2:006:0	“ But as for Me , I have installed My KingUpon Zion , My holy mountain . ”
19:2:007:0	“ I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord : He said to Me , ‘You are My Son , Today I have begotten You .
19:2:008:0	Ask of Me , and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance , And the very ends of the earth as Your possession .
19:2:009:0	You shall break them with a rod of iron , You shall shatter them like earthenware . ’ ”
19:2:010:0	Now therefore , O kings , show discernment ; Take warning , O judges of the earth .
19:2:011:0	Worship the Lord with reverenceAnd rejoice with trembling .
19:2:012:0	Do homage to the Son , that He not become angry , and you perish in the way , For His wrath may soon be kindled . How blessed are all who take refuge in Him !
