19:144:003:1	
19:144:004:1	A Psalm
19:144:005:1	of David .
19:144:001:0	Blessed be the Lord , my rock , Who trains my hands for war , And my fingers for battle ;
19:144:002:0	My lovingkindness and my fortress , My stronghold and my deliverer , My shield and He in whom I take refuge , Who subdues my people under me .
19:144:003:0	O Lord , what is man , that You take knowledge of him ? Or the son of man , that You think of him ?
19:144:004:0	Man is like a mere breath ; His days are like a passing shadow .
19:144:005:0	Bow Your heavens , O Lord , and come down ; Touch the mountains , that they may smoke .
19:144:006:0	Flash forth lightning and scatter them ; Send out Your arrows and confuse them .
19:144:007:0	Stretch forth Your hand from on high ; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters , Out of the hand of aliens
19:144:008:0	Whose mouths speak deceit , And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
19:144:009:0	I will sing a new song to You , O God ; Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You ,
19:144:010:0	Who gives salvation to kings , Who rescues David His servant from the evil sword .
19:144:011:0	Rescue me and deliver me out of the hand of aliens , Whose mouth speaks deceitAnd whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
19:144:012:0	Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants , And our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace ;
19:144:013:0	Let our garners be full , furnishing every kind of produce , And our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields ;
19:144:014:0	Let our cattle bearWithout mishap and without loss , Let there be no outcry in our streets !
19:144:015:0	How blessed are the people who are so situated ; How blessed are the people whose God is the Lord !
