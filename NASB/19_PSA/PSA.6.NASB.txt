19:6:001:1	PSALM 6
19:6:002:1	Prayer for Mercy in Time of Trouble .
19:6:003:1	For the choir director ; with stringed instruments , upon an eight-string lyre . A Psalm of David .
19:6:001:0	O Lord , do not rebuke me in Your anger , Nor chasten me in Your wrath .
19:6:002:0	Be gracious to me , O Lord , for I am pining away ; Heal me , O Lord , for my bones are dismayed .
19:6:003:0	And my soul is greatly dismayed ; But You , O Lordâ€”how long ?
19:6:004:0	Return , O Lord , rescue my soul ; Save me because of Your lovingkindness .
19:6:005:0	For there is no mention of You in death ; In Sheol who will give You thanks ?
19:6:006:0	I am weary with my sighing ; Every night I make my bed swim , I dissolve my couch with my tears .
19:6:007:0	My eye has wasted away with grief ; It has become old because of all my adversaries .
19:6:008:0	Depart from me , all you who do iniquity , For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping .
19:6:009:0	The Lord has heard my supplication , The Lord receives my prayer .
19:6:010:0	All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed ; They shall turn back , they will suddenly be ashamed .
