19:52:001:1	PSALM 52
19:52:002:1	Futility of Boastful Wickedness .
19:52:003:1	For the choir director . A Maskil of David , when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul and said to him , “ David has come to the house of Ahimelech . ”
19:52:001:0	Why do you boast in evil , O mighty man ? The lovingkindness of God endures all day long .
19:52:002:0	Your tongue devises destruction , Like a sharp razor , O worker of deceit .
19:52:003:0	You love evil more than good , Falsehood more than speaking what is right . Selah .
19:52:004:0	You love all words that devour , O deceitful tongue .
19:52:005:0	But God will break you down forever ; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent , And uproot you from the land of the living . Selah .
19:52:006:0	The righteous will see and fear , And will laugh at him , saying ,
19:52:007:0	“ Behold , the man who would not make God his refuge , But trusted in the abundance of his riches And was strong in his evil desire . ”
19:52:008:0	But as for me , I am like a green olive tree in the house of God ; I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever .
19:52:009:0	I will give You thanks forever , because You have done it , And I will wait on Your name , for it is good , in the presence of Your godly ones .
