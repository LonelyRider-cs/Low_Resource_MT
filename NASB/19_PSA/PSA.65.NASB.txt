19:65:001:1	PSALM 65
19:65:002:1	Godâ€™s Abundant Favor to Earth and Man .
19:65:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David . A Song .
19:65:001:0	There will be silence before You , and praise in Zion , O God , And to You the vow will be performed .
19:65:002:0	O You who hear prayer , To You all men come .
19:65:003:0	Iniquities prevail against me ; As for our transgressions , You forgive them .
19:65:004:0	How blessed is the one whom You choose and bring near to YouTo dwell in Your courts . We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house , Your holy temple .
19:65:005:0	By awesome deeds You answer us in righteousness , O God of our salvation , You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea ;
19:65:006:0	Who establishes the mountains by His strength , Being girded with might ;
19:65:007:0	Who stills the roaring of the seas , The roaring of their waves , And the tumult of the peoples .
19:65:008:0	They who dwell in the ends of the earth stand in awe of Your signs ; You make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy .
19:65:009:0	You visit the earth and cause it to overflow ; You greatly enrich it ; The stream of God is full of water ; You prepare their grain , for thus You prepare the earth .
19:65:010:0	You water its furrows abundantly , You settle its ridges , You soften it with showers , You bless its growth .
19:65:011:0	You have crowned the year with Your bounty , And Your paths drip with fatness .
19:65:012:0	The pastures of the wilderness drip , And the hills gird themselves with rejoicing .
19:65:013:0	The meadows are clothed with flocksAnd the valleys are covered with grain ; They shout for joy , yes , they sing .
