19:5:001:1	PSALM 5
19:5:002:1	Prayer for Protection from the Wicked .
19:5:003:1	For the choir director ; for flute accompaniment . A Psalm of David .
19:5:001:0	Give ear to my words , O Lord , Consider my groaning .
19:5:002:0	Heed the sound of my cry for help , my King and my God , For to You I pray .
19:5:003:0	In the morning , O Lord , You will hear my voice ; In the morning I will order my prayer to You and eagerly watch .
19:5:004:0	For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness ; No evil dwells with You .
19:5:005:0	The boastful shall not stand before Your eyes ; You hate all who do iniquity .
19:5:006:0	You destroy those who speak falsehood ; The Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit .
19:5:007:0	But as for me , by Your abundant lovingkindness I will enter Your house , At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence for You .
19:5:008:0	O Lord , lead me in Your righteousness because of my foes ; Make Your way straight before me .
19:5:009:0	There is nothing reliable in what they say ; Their inward part is destruction itself . Their throat is an open grave ; They flatter with their tongue .
19:5:010:0	Hold them guilty , O God ; By their own devices let them fall ! In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out , For they are rebellious against You .
19:5:011:0	But let all who take refuge in You be glad , Let them ever sing for joy ; And may You shelter them , That those who love Your name may exult in You .
19:5:012:0	For it is You who blesses the righteous man , O Lord , You surround him with favor as with a shield .
