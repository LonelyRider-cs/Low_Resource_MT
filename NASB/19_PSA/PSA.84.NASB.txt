19:84:001:1	PSALM 84
19:84:002:1	Longing for the Temple Worship .
19:84:003:1	For the choir director ; on the Gittith . A Psalm of the sons of Korah .
19:84:001:0	How lovely are Your dwelling places , O Lord of hosts !
19:84:002:0	My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the Lord ; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God .
19:84:003:0	The bird also has found a house , And the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , Even Your altars , O Lord of hosts , My King and my God .
19:84:004:0	How blessed are those who dwell in Your house ! They are ever praising You . Selah .
19:84:005:0	How blessed is the man whose strength is in You , In whose heart are the highways to Zion !
19:84:006:0	Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a spring ; The early rain also covers it with blessings .
19:84:007:0	They go from strength to strength , Every one of them appears before God in Zion .
19:84:008:0	O Lord God of hosts , hear my prayer ; Give ear , O God of Jacob ! Selah .
19:84:009:0	Behold our shield , O God , And look upon the face of Your anointed .
19:84:010:0	For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand outside . I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my GodThan dwell in the tents of wickedness .
19:84:011:0	For the Lord God is a sun and shield ; The Lord gives grace and glory ; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly .
19:84:012:0	O Lord of hosts , How blessed is the man who trusts in You !
