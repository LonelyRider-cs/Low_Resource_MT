19:56:001:1	PSALM 56
19:56:002:1	Supplication for Deliverance and Grateful Trust in God .
19:56:003:1	For the choir director ; according to Jonath elem rehokim . A Mikhtam of David , when the Philistines seized him in Gath .
19:56:001:0	Be gracious to me , O God , for man has trampled upon me ; Fighting all day long he oppresses me .
19:56:002:0	My foes have trampled upon me all day long , For they are many who fight proudly against me .
19:56:003:0	When I am afraid , I will put my trust in You .
19:56:004:0	In God , whose word I praise , In God I have put my trust ; I shall not be afraid . What can mere man do to me ?
19:56:005:0	All day long they distort my words ; All their thoughts are against me for evil .
19:56:006:0	They attack , they lurk , They watch my steps , As they have waited to take my life .
19:56:007:0	Because of wickedness , cast them forth , In anger put down the peoples , O God !
19:56:008:0	You have taken account of my wanderings ; Put my tears in Your bottle . Are they not in Your book ?
19:56:009:0	Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call ; This I know , that God is for me .
19:56:010:0	In God , whose word I praise , In the Lord , whose word I praise ,
19:56:011:0	In God I have put my trust , I shall not be afraid . What can man do to me ?
19:56:012:0	Your vows are binding upon me , O God ; I will render thank offerings to You .
19:56:013:0	For You have delivered my soul from death , Indeed my feet from stumbling , So that I may walk before GodIn the light of the living .
