19:107:005:1	Delivers Men from Manifold Troubles .
19:107:001:0	Oh give thanks to the Lord , for He is good , For His lovingkindness is everlasting .
19:107:002:0	Let the redeemed of the Lord say so , Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary
19:107:003:0	And gathered from the lands , From the east and from the west , From the north and from the south .
19:107:004:0	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert region ; They did not find a way to an inhabited city .
19:107:005:0	They were hungry and thirsty ; Their soul fainted within them .
19:107:006:0	Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble ; He delivered them out of their distresses .
19:107:007:0	He led them also by a straight way , To go to an inhabited city .
19:107:008:0	Let them give thanks to the Lord for His lovingkindness , And for His wonders to the sons of men !
19:107:009:0	For He has satisfied the thirsty soul , And the hungry soul He has filled with what is good .
19:107:010:0	There were those who dwelt in darkness and in the shadow of death , Prisoners in misery and chains ,
19:107:011:0	Because they had rebelled against the words of GodAnd spurned the counsel of the Most High .
19:107:012:0	Therefore He humbled their heart with labor ; They stumbled and there was none to help .
19:107:013:0	Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble ; He saved them out of their distresses .
19:107:014:0	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of deathAnd broke their bands apart .
19:107:015:0	Let them give thanks to the Lord for His lovingkindness , And for His wonders to the sons of men !
19:107:016:0	For He has shattered gates of bronzeAnd cut bars of iron asunder .
19:107:017:0	Fools , because of their rebellious way , And because of their iniquities , were afflicted .
19:107:018:0	Their soul abhorred all kinds of food , And they drew near to the gates of death .
19:107:019:0	Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble ; He saved them out of their distresses .
19:107:020:0	He sent His word and healed them , And delivered them from their destructions .
19:107:021:0	Let them give thanks to the Lord for His lovingkindness , And for His wonders to the sons of men !
19:107:022:0	Let them also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving , And tell of His works with joyful singing .
19:107:023:0	Those who go down to the sea in ships , Who do business on great waters ;
19:107:024:0	They have seen the works of the Lord , And His wonders in the deep .
19:107:025:0	For He spoke and raised up a stormy wind , Which lifted up the waves of the sea .
19:107:026:0	They rose up to the heavens , they went down to the depths ; Their soul melted away in their misery .
19:107:027:0	They reeled and staggered like a drunken man , And were at their witsâ€™ end .
19:107:028:0	Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble , And He brought them out of their distresses .
19:107:029:0	He caused the storm to be still , So that the waves of the sea were hushed .
19:107:030:0	Then they were glad because they were quiet , So He guided them to their desired haven .
19:107:031:0	Let them give thanks to the Lord for His lovingkindness , And for His wonders to the sons of men !
19:107:032:0	Let them extol Him also in the congregation of the people , And praise Him at the seat of the elders .
19:107:033:0	He changes rivers into a wildernessAnd springs of water into a thirsty ground ;
19:107:034:0	A fruitful land into a salt waste , Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it .
19:107:035:0	He changes a wilderness into a pool of waterAnd a dry land into springs of water ;
19:107:036:0	And there He makes the hungry to dwell , So that they may establish an inhabited city ,
19:107:037:0	And sow fields and plant vineyards , And gather a fruitful harvest .
19:107:038:0	Also He blesses them and they multiply greatly , And He does not let their cattle decrease .
19:107:039:0	When they are diminished and bowed downThrough oppression , misery and sorrow ,
19:107:040:0	He pours contempt upon princesAnd makes them wander in a pathless waste .
19:107:041:0	But He sets the needy securely on high away from affliction , And makes his families like a flock .
19:107:042:0	The upright see it and are glad ; But all unrighteousness shuts its mouth .
19:107:043:0	Who is wise ? Let him give heed to these things , And consider the lovingkindnesses of the Lord .
