19:94:001:1	PSALM 94
19:94:002:1	The L
19:94:003:1	ord
19:94:004:1	Implored to Avenge His People .
19:94:001:0	O Lord , God of vengeance , God of vengeance , shine forth !
19:94:002:0	Rise up , O Judge of the earth , Render recompense to the proud .
19:94:003:0	How long shall the wicked , O Lord , How long shall the wicked exult ?
19:94:004:0	They pour forth words , they speak arrogantly ; All who do wickedness vaunt themselves .
19:94:005:0	They crush Your people , O Lord , And afflict Your heritage .
19:94:006:0	They slay the widow and the strangerAnd murder the orphans .
19:94:007:0	They have said , “ The Lord does not see , Nor does the God of Jacob pay heed . ”
19:94:008:0	Pay heed , you senseless among the people ; And when will you understand , stupid ones ?
19:94:009:0	He who planted the ear , does He not hear ? He who formed the eye , does He not see ?
19:94:010:0	He who chastens the nations , will He not rebuke , Even He who teaches man knowledge ?
19:94:011:0	The Lord knows the thoughts of man , That they are a mere breath .
19:94:012:0	Blessed is the man whom You chasten , O Lord , And whom You teach out of Your law ;
19:94:013:0	That You may grant him relief from the days of adversity , Until a pit is dug for the wicked .
19:94:014:0	For the Lord will not abandon His people , Nor will He forsake His inheritance .
19:94:015:0	For judgment will again be righteous , And all the upright in heart will follow it .
19:94:016:0	Who will stand up for me against evildoers ? Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness ?
19:94:017:0	If the Lord had not been my help , My soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence .
19:94:018:0	If I should say , “ My foot has slipped , ” Your lovingkindness , O Lord , will hold me up .
19:94:019:0	When my anxious thoughts multiply within me , Your consolations delight my soul .
19:94:020:0	Can a throne of destruction be allied with You , One which devises mischief by decree ?
19:94:021:0	They band themselves together against the life of the righteousAnd condemn the innocent to death .
19:94:022:0	But the Lord has been my stronghold , And my God the rock of my refuge .
19:94:023:0	He has brought back their wickedness upon themAnd will destroy them in their evil ; The Lord our God will destroy them .
