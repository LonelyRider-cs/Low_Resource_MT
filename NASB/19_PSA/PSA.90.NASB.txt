19:90:002:1	PSALM 90
19:90:003:1	God’s Eternity and Man’s Transitoriness .
19:90:004:1	A Prayer of Moses , the man of God .
19:90:001:0	Lord , You have been our dwelling place in all generations .
19:90:002:0	Before the mountains were bornOr You gave birth to the earth and the world , Even from everlasting to everlasting , You are God .
19:90:003:0	You turn man back into dustAnd say , “ Return , O children of men . ”
19:90:004:0	For a thousand years in Your sightAre like yesterday when it passes by , Or as a watch in the night .
19:90:005:0	You have swept them away like a flood , they fall asleep ; In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew .
19:90:006:0	In the morning it flourishes and sprouts anew ; Toward evening it fades and withers away .
19:90:007:0	For we have been consumed by Your angerAnd by Your wrath we have been dismayed .
19:90:008:0	You have placed our iniquities before You , Our secret sins in the light of Your presence .
19:90:009:0	For all our days have declined in Your fury ; We have finished our years like a sigh .
19:90:010:0	As for the days of our life , they contain seventy years , Or if due to strength , eighty years , Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow ; For soon it is gone and we fly away .
19:90:011:0	Who understands the power of Your angerAnd Your fury , according to the fear that is due You ?
19:90:012:0	So teach us to number our days , That we may present to You a heart of wisdom .
19:90:013:0	Do return , O Lord ; how long will it be ? And be sorry for Your servants .
19:90:014:0	O satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness , That we may sing for joy and be glad all our days .
19:90:015:0	Make us glad according to the days You have afflicted us , And the years we have seen evil .
19:90:016:0	Let Your work appear to Your servantsAnd Your majesty to their children .
19:90:017:0	Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us ; And confirm for us the work of our hands ; Yes , confirm the work of our hands .
