19:43:001:1	PSALM 43
19:43:002:1	Prayer for Deliverance .
19:43:001:0	Vindicate me , O God , and plead my case against an ungodly nation ; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man !
19:43:002:0	For You are the God of my strength ; why have You rejected me ? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
19:43:003:0	O send out Your light and Your truth , let them lead me ; Let them bring me to Your holy hillAnd to Your dwelling places .
19:43:004:0	Then I will go to the altar of God , To God my exceeding joy ; And upon the lyre I shall praise You , O God , my God .
19:43:005:0	Why are you in despair , O my soul ? And why are you disturbed within me ? Hope in God , for I shall again praise Him , The help of my countenance and my God .
