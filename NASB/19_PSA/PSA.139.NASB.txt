19:139:001:1	PSALM 139
19:139:002:1	God’s Omnipresence and Omniscience .
19:139:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:139:001:0	O Lord , You have searched me and known me .
19:139:002:0	You know when I sit down and when I rise up ; You understand my thought from afar .
19:139:003:0	You scrutinize my path and my lying down , And are intimately acquainted with all my ways .
19:139:004:0	Even before there is a word on my tongue , Behold , O Lord , You know it all .
19:139:005:0	You have enclosed me behind and before , And laid Your hand upon me .
19:139:006:0	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me ; It is too high , I cannot attain to it .
19:139:007:0	Where can I go from Your Spirit ? Or where can I flee from Your presence ?
19:139:008:0	If I ascend to heaven , You are there ; If I make my bed in Sheol , behold , You are there .
19:139:009:0	If I take the wings of the dawn , If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea ,
19:139:010:0	Even there Your hand will lead me , And Your right hand will lay hold of me .
19:139:011:0	If I say , “ Surely the darkness will overwhelm me , And the light around me will be night , ”
19:139:012:0	Even the darkness is not dark to You , And the night is as bright as the day . Darkness and light are alike to You .
19:139:013:0	For You formed my inward parts ; You wove me in my mother’s womb .
19:139:014:0	I will give thanks to You , for I am fearfully and wonderfully made ; Wonderful are Your works , And my soul knows it very well .
19:139:015:0	My frame was not hidden from You , When I was made in secret , And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth ;
19:139:016:0	Your eyes have seen my unformed substance ; And in Your book were all writtenThe days that were ordained for me , When as yet there was not one of them .
19:139:017:0	How precious also are Your thoughts to me , O God ! How vast is the sum of them !
19:139:018:0	If I should count them , they would outnumber the sand . When I awake , I am still with You .
19:139:019:0	O that You would slay the wicked , O God ; Depart from me , therefore , men of bloodshed .
19:139:020:0	For they speak against You wickedly , And Your enemies take Your name in vain .
19:139:021:0	Do I not hate those who hate You , O Lord ? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You ?
19:139:022:0	I hate them with the utmost hatred ; They have become my enemies .
19:139:023:0	Search me , O God , and know my heart ; Try me and know my anxious thoughts ;
19:139:024:0	And see if there be any hurtful way in me , And lead me in the everlasting way .
