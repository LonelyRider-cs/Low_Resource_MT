19:73:002:1	PSALM 73
19:73:003:1	The End of the Wicked Contrasted with That of the Righteous .
19:73:004:1	A Psalm of Asaph .
19:73:001:0	Surely God is good to Israel , To those who are pure in heart !
19:73:002:0	But as for me , my feet came close to stumbling , My steps had almost slipped .
19:73:003:0	For I was envious of the arrogant As I saw the prosperity of the wicked .
19:73:004:0	For there are no pains in their death , And their body is fat .
19:73:005:0	They are not in trouble as other men , Nor are they plagued like mankind .
19:73:006:0	Therefore pride is their necklace ; The garment of violence covers them .
19:73:007:0	Their eye bulges from fatness ; The imaginations of their heart run riot .
19:73:008:0	They mock and wickedly speak of oppression ; They speak from on high .
19:73:009:0	They have set their mouth against the heavens , And their tongue parades through the earth .
19:73:010:0	Therefore his people return to this place , And waters of abundance are drunk by them .
19:73:011:0	They say , “ How does God know ? And is there knowledge with the Most High ? ”
19:73:012:0	Behold , these are the wicked ; And always at ease , they have increased in wealth .
19:73:013:0	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pureAnd washed my hands in innocence ;
19:73:014:0	For I have been stricken all day longAnd chastened every morning .
19:73:015:0	If I had said , “ I will speak thus , ” Behold , I would have betrayed the generation of Your children .
19:73:016:0	When I pondered to understand this , It was troublesome in my sight
19:73:017:0	Until I came into the sanctuary of God ; Then I perceived their end .
19:73:018:0	Surely You set them in slippery places ; You cast them down to destruction .
19:73:019:0	How they are destroyed in a moment ! They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors !
19:73:020:0	Like a dream when one awakes , O Lord , when aroused , You will despise their form .
19:73:021:0	When my heart was embitteredAnd I was pierced within ,
19:73:022:0	Then I was senseless and ignorant ; I was like a beast before You .
19:73:023:0	Nevertheless I am continually with You ; You have taken hold of my right hand .
19:73:024:0	With Your counsel You will guide me , And afterward receive me to glory .
19:73:025:0	Whom have I in heaven but You ? And besides You , I desire nothing on earth .
19:73:026:0	My flesh and my heart may fail , But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever .
19:73:027:0	For , behold , those who are far from You will perish ; You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to You .
19:73:028:0	But as for me , the nearness of God is my good ; I have made the Lord God my refuge , That I may tell of all Your works .
