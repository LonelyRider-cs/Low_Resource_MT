19:89:006:1	Covenant with David , and Israel’s Afflictions .
19:89:007:1	A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite .
19:89:001:0	I will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever ; To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth .
19:89:002:0	For I have said , “ Lovingkindness will be built up forever ; In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness . ”
19:89:003:0	“ I have made a covenant with My chosen ; I have sworn to David My servant ,
19:89:004:0	I will establish your seed foreverAnd build up your throne to all generations . ” Selah .
19:89:005:0	The heavens will praise Your wonders , O Lord ; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones .
19:89:006:0	For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord ? Who among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord ,
19:89:007:0	A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones , And awesome above all those who are around Him ?
19:89:008:0	O Lord God of hosts , who is like You , O mighty Lord ? Your faithfulness also surrounds You .
19:89:009:0	You rule the swelling of the sea ; When its waves rise , You still them .
19:89:010:0	You Yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain ; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm .
19:89:011:0	The heavens are Yours , the earth also is Yours ; The world and all it contains , You have founded them .
19:89:012:0	The north and the south , You have created them ; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name .
19:89:013:0	You have a strong arm ; Your hand is mighty , Your right hand is exalted .
19:89:014:0	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne ; Lovingkindness and truth go before You .
19:89:015:0	How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound ! O Lord , they walk in the light of Your countenance .
19:89:016:0	In Your name they rejoice all the day , And by Your righteousness they are exalted .
19:89:017:0	For You are the glory of their strength , And by Your favor our horn is exalted .
19:89:018:0	For our shield belongs to the Lord , And our king to the Holy One of Israel .
19:89:019:0	Once You spoke in vision to Your godly ones , And said , “ I have given help to one who is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen from the people .
19:89:020:0	I have found David My servant ; With My holy oil I have anointed him ,
19:89:021:0	With whom My hand will be established ; My arm also will strengthen him .
19:89:022:0	The enemy will not deceive him , Nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
19:89:023:0	But I shall crush his adversaries before him , And strike those who hate him .
19:89:024:0	My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with him , And in My name his horn will be exalted .
19:89:025:0	I shall also set his hand on the seaAnd his right hand on the rivers .
19:89:026:0	He will cry to Me , ‘You are my Father , My God , and the rock of my salvation . ’
19:89:027:0	I also shall make him My firstborn , The highest of the kings of the earth .
19:89:028:0	My lovingkindness I will keep for him forever , And My covenant shall be confirmed to him .
19:89:029:0	So I will establish his descendants foreverAnd his throne as the days of heaven .
19:89:030:0	“ If his sons forsake My lawAnd do not walk in My judgments ,
19:89:031:0	If they violate My statutesAnd do not keep My commandments ,
19:89:032:0	Then I will punish their transgression with the rodAnd their iniquity with stripes .
19:89:033:0	But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him , Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness .
19:89:034:0	My covenant I will not violate , Nor will I alter the utterance of My lips .
19:89:035:0	Once I have sworn by My holiness ; I will not lie to David .
19:89:036:0	His descendants shall endure foreverAnd his throne as the sun before Me .
19:89:037:0	It shall be established forever like the moon , And the witness in the sky is faithful . ” Selah .
19:89:038:0	But You have cast off and rejected , You have been full of wrath against Your anointed .
19:89:039:0	You have spurned the covenant of Your servant ; You have profaned his crown in the dust .
19:89:040:0	You have broken down all his walls ; You have brought his strongholds to ruin .
19:89:041:0	All who pass along the way plunder him ; He has become a reproach to his neighbors .
19:89:042:0	You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries ; You have made all his enemies rejoice .
19:89:043:0	You also turn back the edge of his swordAnd have not made him stand in battle .
19:89:044:0	You have made his splendor to ceaseAnd cast his throne to the ground .
19:89:045:0	You have shortened the days of his youth ; You have covered him with shame . Selah .
19:89:046:0	How long , O Lord ? Will You hide Yourself forever ? Will Your wrath burn like fire ?
19:89:047:0	Remember what my span of life is ; For what vanity You have created all the sons of men !
19:89:048:0	What man can live and not see death ? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ? Selah .
19:89:049:0	Where are Your former lovingkindnesses , O Lord , Which You swore to David in Your faithfulness ?
19:89:050:0	Remember , O Lord , the reproach of Your servants ; How I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the many peoples ,
19:89:051:0	With which Your enemies have reproached , O Lord , With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed .
19:89:052:0	Blessed be the Lord forever ! Amen and Amen .
