19:147:001:1	PSALM 147
19:147:002:1	Praise for Jerusalemâ€™s Restoration and Prosperity .
19:147:001:0	Praise the Lord ! For it is good to sing praises to our God ; For it is pleasant and praise is becoming .
19:147:002:0	The Lord builds up Jerusalem ; He gathers the outcasts of Israel .
19:147:003:0	He heals the brokenheartedAnd binds up their wounds .
19:147:004:0	He counts the number of the stars ; He gives names to all of them .
19:147:005:0	Great is our Lord and abundant in strength ; His understanding is infinite .
19:147:006:0	The Lord supports the afflicted ; He brings down the wicked to the ground .
19:147:007:0	Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving ; Sing praises to our God on the lyre ,
19:147:008:0	Who covers the heavens with clouds , Who provides rain for the earth , Who makes grass to grow on the mountains .
19:147:009:0	He gives to the beast its food , And to the young ravens which cry .
19:147:010:0	He does not delight in the strength of the horse ; He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man .
19:147:011:0	The Lord favors those who fear Him , Those who wait for His lovingkindness .
19:147:012:0	Praise the Lord , O Jerusalem ! Praise your God , O Zion !
19:147:013:0	For He has strengthened the bars of your gates ; He has blessed your sons within you .
19:147:014:0	He makes peace in your borders ; He satisfies you with the finest of the wheat .
19:147:015:0	He sends forth His command to the earth ; His word runs very swiftly .
19:147:016:0	He gives snow like wool ; He scatters the frost like ashes .
19:147:017:0	He casts forth His ice as fragments ; Who can stand before His cold ?
19:147:018:0	He sends forth His word and melts them ; He causes His wind to blow and the waters to flow .
19:147:019:0	He declares His words to Jacob , His statutes and His ordinances to Israel .
19:147:020:0	He has not dealt thus with any nation ; And as for His ordinances , they have not known them . Praise the Lord !
