19:143:001:1	PSALM 143
19:143:002:1	Prayer for Deliverance and Guidance .
19:143:003:1	A Psalm of David .
19:143:001:0	Hear my prayer , O Lord , Give ear to my supplications ! Answer me in Your faithfulness , in Your righteousness !
19:143:002:0	And do not enter into judgment with Your servant , For in Your sight no man living is righteous .
19:143:003:0	For the enemy has persecuted my soul ; He has crushed my life to the ground ; He has made me dwell in dark places , like those who have long been dead .
19:143:004:0	Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me ; My heart is appalled within me .
19:143:005:0	I remember the days of old ; I meditate on all Your doings ; I muse on the work of Your hands .
19:143:006:0	I stretch out my hands to You ; My soul longs for You , as a parched land . Selah .
19:143:007:0	Answer me quickly , O Lord , my spirit fails ; Do not hide Your face from me , Or I will become like those who go down to the pit .
19:143:008:0	Let me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning ; For I trust in You ; Teach me the way in which I should walk ; For to You I lift up my soul .
19:143:009:0	Deliver me , O Lord , from my enemies ; I take refuge in You .
19:143:010:0	Teach me to do Your will , For You are my God ; Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground .
19:143:011:0	For the sake of Your name , O Lord , revive me . In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble .
19:143:012:0	And in Your lovingkindness , cut off my enemiesAnd destroy all those who afflict my soul , For I am Your servant .
