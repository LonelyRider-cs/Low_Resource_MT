19:9:003:1	For the choir director ; on
19:9:004:1	I . e . “ Death to the Son ”
19:9:005:1	Muth-labben . A Psalm of David .
19:9:001:0	I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart ; I will tell of all Your wonders .
19:9:002:0	I will be glad and exult in You ; I will sing praise to Your name , O Most High .
19:9:003:0	When my enemies turn back , They stumble and perish before You .
19:9:004:0	For You have maintained my just cause ; You have sat on the throne judging righteously .
19:9:005:0	You have rebuked the nations , You have destroyed the wicked ; You have blotted out their name forever and ever .
19:9:006:0	The enemy has come to an end in perpetual ruins , And You have uprooted the cities ; The very memory of them has perished .
19:9:007:0	But the Lord abides forever ; He has established His throne for judgment ,
19:9:008:0	And He will judge the world in righteousness ; He will execute judgment for the peoples with equity .
19:9:009:0	The Lord also will be a stronghold for the oppressed , A stronghold in times of trouble ;
19:9:010:0	And those who know Your name will put their trust in You , For You , O Lord , have not forsaken those who seek You .
19:9:011:0	Sing praises to the Lord , who dwells in Zion ; Declare among the peoples His deeds .
19:9:012:0	For He who requires blood remembers them ; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted .
19:9:013:0	Be gracious to me , O Lord ; See my affliction from those who hate me , You who lift me up from the gates of death ,
19:9:014:0	That I may tell of all Your praises , That in the gates of the daughter of ZionI may rejoice in Your salvation .
19:9:015:0	The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made ; In the net which they hid , their own foot has been caught .
19:9:016:0	The Lord has made Himself known ; He has executed judgment . In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared . Higgaion Selah .
19:9:017:0	The wicked will return to Sheol , Even all the nations who forget God .
19:9:018:0	For the needy will not always be forgotten , Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever .
19:9:019:0	Arise , O Lord , do not let man prevail ; Let the nations be judged before You .
19:9:020:0	Put them in fear , O Lord ; Let the nations know that they are but men . Selah .
