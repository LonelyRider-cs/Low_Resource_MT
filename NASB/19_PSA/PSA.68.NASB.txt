19:68:001:1	PSALM 68
19:68:002:1	The God of Sinai and of the Sanctuary .
19:68:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David . A Song .
19:68:001:0	Let God arise , let His enemies be scattered , And let those who hate Him flee before Him .
19:68:002:0	As smoke is driven away , so drive them away ; As wax melts before the fire , So let the wicked perish before God .
19:68:003:0	But let the righteous be glad ; let them exult before God ; Yes , let them rejoice with gladness .
19:68:004:0	Sing to God , sing praises to His name ; Lift up a song for Him who rides through the deserts , Whose name is the Lord , and exult before Him .
19:68:005:0	A father of the fatherless and a judge for the widows , Is God in His holy habitation .
19:68:006:0	God makes a home for the lonely ; He leads out the prisoners into prosperity , Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land .
19:68:007:0	O God , when You went forth before Your people , When You marched through the wilderness , Selah .
19:68:008:0	The earth quaked ; The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God ; Sinai itself quaked at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
19:68:009:0	You shed abroad a plentiful rain , O God ; You confirmed Your inheritance when it was parched .
19:68:010:0	Your creatures settled in it ; You provided in Your goodness for the poor , O God .
19:68:011:0	The Lord gives the command ; The women who proclaim the good tidings are a great host :
19:68:012:0	“ Kings of armies flee , they flee , And she who remains at home will divide the spoil ! ”
19:68:013:0	When you lie down among the sheepfolds , You are like the wings of a dove covered with silver , And its pinions with glistening gold .
19:68:014:0	When the Almighty scattered the kings there , It was snowing in Zalmon .
19:68:015:0	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan ; A mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan .
19:68:016:0	Why do you look with envy , O mountains with many peaks , At the mountain which God has desired for His abode ? Surely the Lord will dwell there forever .
19:68:017:0	The chariots of God are myriads , thousands upon thousands ; The Lord is among them as at Sinai , in holiness .
19:68:018:0	You have ascended on high , You have led captive Your captives ; You have received gifts among men , Even among the rebellious also , that the Lord God may dwell there .
19:68:019:0	Blessed be the Lord , who daily bears our burden , The God who is our salvation . Selah .
19:68:020:0	God is to us a God of deliverances ; And to God the Lord belong escapes from death .
19:68:021:0	Surely God will shatter the head of His enemies , The hairy crown of him who goes on in his guilty deeds .
19:68:022:0	The Lord said , “ I will bring them back from Bashan . I will bring them back from the depths of the sea ;
19:68:023:0	That your foot may shatter them in blood , The tongue of your dogs may have its portion from your enemies . ”
19:68:024:0	They have seen Your procession , O God , The procession of my God , my King , into the sanctuary .
19:68:025:0	The singers went on , the musicians after them , In the midst of the maidens beating tambourines .
19:68:026:0	Bless God in the congregations , Even the Lord , you who are of the fountain of Israel .
19:68:027:0	There is Benjamin , the youngest , ruling them , The princes of Judah in their throng , The princes of Zebulun , the princes of Naphtali .
19:68:028:0	Your God has commanded your strength ; Show Yourself strong , O God , who have acted on our behalf .
19:68:029:0	Because of Your temple at JerusalemKings will bring gifts to You .
19:68:030:0	Rebuke the beasts in the reeds , The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples , Trampling under foot the pieces of silver ; He has scattered the peoples who delight in war .
19:68:031:0	Envoys will come out of Egypt ; Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God .
19:68:032:0	Sing to God , O kingdoms of the earth , Sing praises to the Lord , Selah .
19:68:033:0	To Him who rides upon the highest heavens , which are from ancient times ; Behold , He speaks forth with His voice , a mighty voice .
19:68:034:0	Ascribe strength to God ; His majesty is over IsraelAnd His strength is in the skies .
19:68:035:0	O God , You are awesome from Your sanctuary . The God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to the people . Blessed be God !
