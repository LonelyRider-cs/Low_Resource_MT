19:41:001:1	PSALM 41
19:41:002:1	The Psalmist in Sickness Complains of Enemies and False Friends .
19:41:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:41:001:0	How blessed is he who considers the helpless ; The Lord will deliver him in a day of trouble .
19:41:002:0	The Lord will protect him and keep him alive , And he shall be called blessed upon the earth ; And do not give him over to the desire of his enemies .
19:41:003:0	The Lord will sustain him upon his sickbed ; In his illness , You restore him to health .
19:41:004:0	As for me , I said , “ O Lord , be gracious to me ; Heal my soul , for I have sinned against You . ”
19:41:005:0	My enemies speak evil against me , “ When will he die , and his name perish ? ”
19:41:006:0	And when he comes to see me , he speaks falsehood ; His heart gathers wickedness to itself ; When he goes outside , he tells it .
19:41:007:0	All who hate me whisper together against me ; Against me they devise my hurt , saying ,
19:41:008:0	“ A wicked thing is poured out upon him , That when he lies down , he will not rise up again . ”
19:41:009:0	Even my close friend in whom I trusted , Who ate my bread , Has lifted up his heel against me .
19:41:010:0	But You , O Lord , be gracious to me and raise me up , That I may repay them .
19:41:011:0	By this I know that You are pleased with me , Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me .
19:41:012:0	As for me , You uphold me in my integrity , And You set me in Your presence forever .
19:41:013:0	Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , From everlasting to everlasting . Amen and Amen .
