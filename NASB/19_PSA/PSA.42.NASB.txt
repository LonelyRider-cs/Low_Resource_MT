19:42:002:1	PSALM 42
19:42:003:1	Thirsting for God in Trouble and Exile .
19:42:004:1	For the choir director . A Maskil of the sons of Korah .
19:42:001:0	As the deer pants for the water brooks , So my soul pants for You , O God .
19:42:002:0	My soul thirsts for God , for the living God ; When shall I come and appear before God ?
19:42:003:0	My tears have been my food day and night , While they say to me all day long , “ Where is your God ? ”
19:42:004:0	These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me . For I used to go along with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God , With the voice of joy and thanksgiving , a multitude keeping festival .
19:42:005:0	Why are you in despair , O my soul ? And why have you become disturbed within me ? Hope in God , for I shall again praise Him For the help of His presence .
19:42:006:0	O my God , my soul is in despair within me ; Therefore I remember You from the land of the JordanAnd the peaks of Hermon , from Mount Mizar .
19:42:007:0	Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls ; All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me .
19:42:008:0	The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime ; And His song will be with me in the night , A prayer to the God of my life .
19:42:009:0	I will say to God my rock , “ Why have You forgotten me ? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ? ”
19:42:010:0	As a shattering of my bones , my adversaries revile me , While they say to me all day long , “ Where is your God ? ”
19:42:011:0	Why are you in despair , O my soul ? And why have you become disturbed within me ? Hope in God , for I shall yet praise Him , The help of my countenance and my God .
