19:83:001:1	PSALM 83
19:83:002:1	God Implored to Confound His Enemies .
19:83:003:1	A Song , a Psalm of Asaph .
19:83:001:0	O God , do not remain quiet ; Do not be silent and , O God , do not be still .
19:83:002:0	For behold , Your enemies make an uproar , And those who hate You have exalted themselves .
19:83:003:0	They make shrewd plans against Your people , And conspire together against Your treasured ones .
19:83:004:0	They have said , “ Come , and let us wipe them out as a nation , That the name of Israel be remembered no more . ”
19:83:005:0	For they have conspired together with one mind ; Against You they make a covenant :
19:83:006:0	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites , Moab and the Hagrites ;
19:83:007:0	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek , Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre ;
19:83:008:0	Assyria also has joined with them ; They have become a help to the children of Lot . Selah .
19:83:009:0	Deal with them as with Midian , As with Sisera and Jabin at the torrent of Kishon ,
19:83:010:0	Who were destroyed at En-dor , Who became as dung for the ground .
19:83:011:0	Make their nobles like Oreb and ZeebAnd all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna ,
19:83:012:0	Who said , “ Let us possess for ourselvesThe pastures of God . ”
19:83:013:0	O my God , make them like the whirling dust , Like chaff before the wind .
19:83:014:0	Like fire that burns the forestAnd like a flame that sets the mountains on fire ,
19:83:015:0	So pursue them with Your tempestAnd terrify them with Your storm .
19:83:016:0	Fill their faces with dishonor , That they may seek Your name , O Lord .
19:83:017:0	Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever , And let them be humiliated and perish ,
19:83:018:0	That they may know that You alone , whose name is the Lord , Are the Most High over all the earth .
