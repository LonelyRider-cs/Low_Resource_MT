19:124:002:0	“ Had it not been the Lord who was on our sideWhen men rose up against us ,
19:124:003:0	Then they would have swallowed us alive , When their anger was kindled against us ;
19:124:004:0	Then the waters would have engulfed us , The stream would have swept over our soul ;
19:124:005:0	Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul . ”
