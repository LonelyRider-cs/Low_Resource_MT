19:49:001:1	PSALM 49
19:49:002:1	The Folly of Trusting in Riches .
19:49:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of the sons of Korah .
19:49:001:0	Hear this , all peoples ; Give ear , all inhabitants of the world ,
19:49:002:0	Both low and high , Rich and poor together .
19:49:003:0	My mouth will speak wisdom , And the meditation of my heart will be understanding .
19:49:004:0	I will incline my ear to a proverb ; I will express my riddle on the harp .
19:49:005:0	Why should I fear in days of adversity , When the iniquity of my foes surrounds me ,
19:49:006:0	Even those who trust in their wealthAnd boast in the abundance of their riches ?
19:49:007:0	No man can by any means redeem his brotherOr give to God a ransom for him—
19:49:008:0	For the redemption of his soul is costly , And he should cease trying forever—
19:49:009:0	That he should live on eternally , That he should not undergo decay .
19:49:010:0	For he sees that even wise men die ; The stupid and the senseless alike perishAnd leave their wealth to others .
19:49:011:0	Their inner thought is that their houses are forever And their dwelling places to all generations ; They have called their lands after their own names .
19:49:012:0	But man in his pomp will not endure ; He is like the beasts that perish .
19:49:013:0	This is the way of those who are foolish , And of those after them who approve their words . Selah .
19:49:014:0	As sheep they are appointed for Sheol ; Death shall be their shepherd ; And the upright shall rule over them in the morning , And their form shall be for Sheol to consumeSo that they have no habitation .
19:49:015:0	But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol , For He will receive me . Selah .
19:49:016:0	Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich , When the glory of his house is increased ;
19:49:017:0	For when he dies he will carry nothing away ; His glory will not descend after him .
19:49:018:0	Though while he lives he congratulates himself—And though men praise you when you do well for yourself—
19:49:019:0	He shall go to the generation of his fathers ; They will never see the light .
19:49:020:0	Man in his pomp , yet without understanding , Is like the beasts that perish .
