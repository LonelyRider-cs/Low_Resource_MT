19:8:006:1	Glory and Man’s Dignity .
19:8:007:1	For the choir director ; on the Gittith . A Psalm of David .
19:8:001:0	O Lord , our Lord , How majestic is Your name in all the earth , Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens !
19:8:002:0	From the mouth of infants and nursing babes You have established strengthBecause of Your adversaries , To make the enemy and the revengeful cease .
19:8:003:0	When I consider Your heavens , the work of Your fingers , The moon and the stars , which You have ordained ;
19:8:004:0	What is man that You take thought of him , And the son of man that You care for him ?
19:8:005:0	Yet You have made him a little lower than God , And You crown him with glory and majesty !
19:8:006:0	You make him to rule over the works of Your hands ; You have put all things under his feet ,
19:8:007:0	All sheep and oxen , And also the beasts of the field ,
19:8:008:0	The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea , Whatever passes through the paths of the seas .
19:8:009:0	O Lord , our Lord , How majestic is Your name in all the earth !
