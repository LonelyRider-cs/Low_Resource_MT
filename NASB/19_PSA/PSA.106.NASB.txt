19:106:006:1	Deliverances .
19:106:001:0	Praise the Lord ! Oh give thanks to the Lord , for He is good ; For His lovingkindness is everlasting .
19:106:002:0	Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the Lord , Or can show forth all His praise ?
19:106:003:0	How blessed are those who keep justice , Who practice righteousness at all times !
19:106:004:0	Remember me , O Lord , in Your favor toward Your people ; Visit me with Your salvation ,
19:106:005:0	That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones , That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation , That I may glory with Your inheritance .
19:106:006:0	We have sinned like our fathers , We have committed iniquity , we have behaved wickedly .
19:106:007:0	Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders ; They did not remember Your abundant kindnesses , But rebelled by the sea , at the Red Sea .
19:106:008:0	Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name , That He might make His power known .
19:106:009:0	Thus He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up , And He led them through the deeps , as through the wilderness .
19:106:010:0	So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated them , And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
19:106:011:0	The waters covered their adversaries ; Not one of them was left .
19:106:012:0	Then they believed His words ; They sang His praise .
19:106:013:0	They quickly forgot His works ; They did not wait for His counsel ,
19:106:014:0	But craved intensely in the wilderness , And tempted God in the desert .
19:106:015:0	So He gave them their request , But sent a wasting disease among them .
19:106:016:0	When they became envious of Moses in the camp , And of Aaron , the holy one of the Lord ,
19:106:017:0	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan , And engulfed the company of Abiram .
19:106:018:0	And a fire blazed up in their company ; The flame consumed the wicked .
19:106:019:0	They made a calf in HorebAnd worshiped a molten image .
19:106:020:0	Thus they exchanged their gloryFor the image of an ox that eats grass .
19:106:021:0	They forgot God their Savior , Who had done great things in Egypt ,
19:106:022:0	Wonders in the land of Ham And awesome things by the Red Sea .
19:106:023:0	Therefore He said that He would destroy them , Had not Moses His chosen one stood in the breach before Him , To turn away His wrath from destroying them .
19:106:024:0	Then they despised the pleasant land ; They did not believe in His word ,
19:106:025:0	But grumbled in their tents ; They did not listen to the voice of the Lord .
19:106:026:0	Therefore He swore to themThat He would cast them down in the wilderness ,
19:106:027:0	And that He would cast their seed among the nationsAnd scatter them in the lands .
19:106:028:0	They joined themselves also to Baal-peor , And ate sacrifices offered to the dead .
19:106:029:0	Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds , And the plague broke out among them .
19:106:030:0	Then Phinehas stood up and interposed , And so the plague was stayed .
19:106:031:0	And it was reckoned to him for righteousness , To all generations forever .
19:106:032:0	They also provoked Him to wrath at the waters of Meribah , So that it went hard with Moses on their account ;
19:106:033:0	Because they were rebellious against His Spirit , He spoke rashly with his lips .
19:106:034:0	They did not destroy the peoples , As the Lord commanded them ,
19:106:035:0	But they mingled with the nationsAnd learned their practices ,
19:106:036:0	And served their idols , Which became a snare to them .
19:106:037:0	They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons ,
19:106:038:0	And shed innocent blood , The blood of their sons and their daughters , Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan ; And the land was polluted with the blood .
19:106:039:0	Thus they became unclean in their practices , And played the harlot in their deeds .
19:106:040:0	Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against His peopleAnd He abhorred His inheritance .
19:106:041:0	Then He gave them into the hand of the nations , And those who hated them ruled over them .
19:106:042:0	Their enemies also oppressed them , And they were subdued under their power .
19:106:043:0	Many times He would deliver them ; They , however , were rebellious in their counsel , And so sank down in their iniquity .
19:106:044:0	Nevertheless He looked upon their distressWhen He heard their cry ;
19:106:045:0	And He remembered His covenant for their sake , And relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness .
19:106:046:0	He also made them objects of compassionIn the presence of all their captors .
19:106:047:0	Save us , O Lord our God , And gather us from among the nations , To give thanks to Your holy nameAnd glory in Your praise .
19:106:048:0	Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , From everlasting even to everlasting . And let all the people say , “ Amen . ” Praise the Lord !
