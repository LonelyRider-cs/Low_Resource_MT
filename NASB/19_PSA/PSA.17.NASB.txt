19:17:001:1	PSALM 17
19:17:002:1	Prayer for Protection against Oppressors .
19:17:003:1	A Prayer of David .
19:17:001:0	Hear a just cause , O Lord , give heed to my cry ; Give ear to my prayer , which is not from deceitful lips .
19:17:002:0	Let my judgment come forth from Your presence ; Let Your eyes look with equity .
19:17:003:0	You have tried my heart ; You have visited me by night ; You have tested me and You find nothing ; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress .
19:17:004:0	As for the deeds of men , by the word of Your lipsI have kept from the paths of the violent .
19:17:005:0	My steps have held fast to Your paths . My feet have not slipped .
19:17:006:0	I have called upon You , for You will answer me , O God ; Incline Your ear to me , hear my speech .
19:17:007:0	Wondrously show Your lovingkindness , O Savior of those who take refuge at Your right handFrom those who rise up against them .
19:17:008:0	Keep me as the apple of the eye ; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings
19:17:009:0	From the wicked who despoil me , My deadly enemies who surround me .
19:17:010:0	They have closed their unfeeling heart , With their mouth they speak proudly .
19:17:011:0	They have now surrounded us in our steps ; They set their eyes to cast us down to the ground .
19:17:012:0	He is like a lion that is eager to tear , And as a young lion lurking in hiding places .
19:17:013:0	Arise , O Lord , confront him , bring him low ; Deliver my soul from the wicked with Your sword ,
19:17:014:0	From men with Your hand , O Lord , From men of the world , whose portion is in this life , And whose belly You fill with Your treasure ; They are satisfied with children , And leave their abundance to their babes .
19:17:015:0	As for me , I shall behold Your face in righteousness ; I will be satisfied with Your likeness when I awake .
