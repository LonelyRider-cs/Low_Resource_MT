19:58:001:1	PSALM 58
19:58:002:1	Prayer for the Punishment of the Wicked .
19:58:003:1	For the choir director ;
19:58:004:1	set to
19:58:005:1	Al-tashheth . A Mikhtam of David .
19:58:001:0	Do you indeed speak righteousness , O gods ? Do you judge uprightly , O sons of men ?
19:58:002:0	No , in heart you work unrighteousness ; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands .
19:58:003:0	The wicked are estranged from the womb ; These who speak lies go astray from birth .
19:58:004:0	They have venom like the venom of a serpent ; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear ,
19:58:005:0	So that it does not hear the voice of charmers , Or a skillful caster of spells .
19:58:006:0	O God , shatter their teeth in their mouth ; Break out the fangs of the young lions , O Lord .
19:58:007:0	Let them flow away like water that runs off ; When he aims his arrows , let them be as headless shafts .
19:58:008:0	Let them be as a snail which melts away as it goes along , Like the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun .
19:58:009:0	Before your pots can feel the fire of thornsHe will sweep them away with a whirlwind , the green and the burning alike .
19:58:010:0	The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance ; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
19:58:011:0	And men will say , “ Surely there is a reward for the righteous ; Surely there is a God who judges on earth ! ”
