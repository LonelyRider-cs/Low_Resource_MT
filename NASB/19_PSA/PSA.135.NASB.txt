19:135:006:1	Wonderful Works . Vanity of Idols .
19:135:001:0	Praise the Lord ! Praise the name of the Lord ; Praise Him , O servants of the Lord ,
19:135:002:0	You who stand in the house of the Lord , In the courts of the house of our God !
19:135:003:0	Praise the Lord , for the Lord is good ; Sing praises to His name , for it is lovely .
19:135:004:0	For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself , Israel for His own possession .
19:135:005:0	For I know that the Lord is greatAnd that our Lord is above all gods .
19:135:006:0	Whatever the Lord pleases , He does , In heaven and in earth , in the seas and in all deeps .
19:135:007:0	He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth ; Who makes lightnings for the rain , Who brings forth the wind from His treasuries .
19:135:008:0	He smote the firstborn of Egypt , Both of man and beast .
19:135:009:0	He sent signs and wonders into your midst , O Egypt , Upon Pharaoh and all his servants .
19:135:010:0	He smote many nationsAnd slew mighty kings ,
19:135:011:0	Sihon , king of the Amorites , And Og , king of Bashan , And all the kingdoms of Canaan ;
19:135:012:0	And He gave their land as a heritage , A heritage to Israel His people .
19:135:013:0	Your name , O Lord , is everlasting , Your remembrance , O Lord , throughout all generations .
19:135:014:0	For the Lord will judge His peopleAnd will have compassion on His servants .
19:135:015:0	The idols of the nations are but silver and gold , The work of man’s hands .
19:135:016:0	They have mouths , but they do not speak ; They have eyes , but they do not see ;
19:135:017:0	They have ears , but they do not hear , Nor is there any breath at all in their mouths .
19:135:018:0	Those who make them will be like them , Yes , everyone who trusts in them .
19:135:019:0	O house of Israel , bless the Lord ; O house of Aaron , bless the Lord ;
19:135:020:0	O house of Levi , bless the Lord ; You who revere the Lord , bless the Lord .
19:135:021:0	Blessed be the Lord from Zion , Who dwells in Jerusalem . Praise the Lord !
