19:127:005:1	A Song of Ascents , of Solomon .
19:127:001:0	Unless the Lord builds the house , They labor in vain who build it ; Unless the Lord guards the city , The watchman keeps awake in vain .
19:127:002:0	It is vain for you to rise up early , To retire late , To eat the bread of painful labors ; For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep .
19:127:003:0	Behold , children are a gift of the Lord , The fruit of the womb is a reward .
19:127:004:0	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior , So are the children of oneâ€™s youth .
19:127:005:0	How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them ; They will not be ashamedWhen they speak with their enemies in the gate .
