19:30:001:1	PSALM 30
19:30:002:1	Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Death .
19:30:003:1	A Psalm ; a Song at the Dedication of the House .
19:30:004:1	A Psalm
19:30:005:1	of David .
19:30:001:0	I will extol You , O Lord , for You have lifted me up , And have not let my enemies rejoice over me .
19:30:002:0	O Lord my God , I cried to You for help , and You healed me .
19:30:003:0	O Lord , You have brought up my soul from Sheol ; You have kept me alive , that I would not go down to the pit .
19:30:004:0	Sing praise to the Lord , you His godly ones , And give thanks to His holy name .
19:30:005:0	For His anger is but for a moment , His favor is for a lifetime ; Weeping may last for the night , But a shout of joy comes in the morning .
19:30:006:0	Now as for me , I said in my prosperity , “ I will never be moved . ”
19:30:007:0	O Lord , by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong ; You hid Your face , I was dismayed .
19:30:008:0	To You , O Lord , I called , And to the Lord I made supplication :
19:30:009:0	“ What profit is there in my blood , if I go down to the pit ? Will the dust praise You ? Will it declare Your faithfulness ?
19:30:010:0	“ Hear , O Lord , and be gracious to me ; O Lord , be my helper . ”
19:30:011:0	You have turned for me my mourning into dancing ; You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness ,
19:30:012:0	That my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent . O Lord my God , I will give thanks to You forever .
