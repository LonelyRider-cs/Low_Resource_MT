19:115:004:1	.
19:115:001:0	Not to us , O Lord , not to us , But to Your name give gloryBecause of Your lovingkindness , because of Your truth .
19:115:002:0	Why should the nations say , “ Where , now , is their God ? ”
19:115:003:0	But our God is in the heavens ; He does whatever He pleases .
19:115:004:0	Their idols are silver and gold , The work of man’s hands .
19:115:005:0	They have mouths , but they cannot speak ; They have eyes , but they cannot see ;
19:115:006:0	They have ears , but they cannot hear ; They have noses , but they cannot smell ;
19:115:007:0	They have hands , but they cannot feel ; They have feet , but they cannot walk ; They cannot make a sound with their throat .
19:115:008:0	Those who make them will become like them , Everyone who trusts in them .
19:115:009:0	O Israel , trust in the Lord ; He is their help and their shield .
19:115:010:0	O house of Aaron , trust in the Lord ; He is their help and their shield .
19:115:011:0	You who fear the Lord , trust in the Lord ; He is their help and their shield .
19:115:012:0	The Lord has been mindful of us ; He will bless us ; He will bless the house of Israel ; He will bless the house of Aaron .
19:115:013:0	He will bless those who fear the Lord , The small together with the great .
19:115:014:0	May the Lord give you increase , You and your children .
19:115:015:0	May you be blessed of the Lord , Maker of heaven and earth .
19:115:016:0	The heavens are the heavens of the Lord , But the earth He has given to the sons of men .
19:115:017:0	The dead do not praise the Lord , Nor do any who go down into silence ;
19:115:018:0	But as for us , we will bless the LordFrom this time forth and forever . Praise the Lord !
