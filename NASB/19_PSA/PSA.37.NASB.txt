19:37:006:1	A Psalm
19:37:007:1	of David .
19:37:001:0	Do not fret because of evildoers , Be not envious toward wrongdoers .
19:37:002:0	For they will wither quickly like the grassAnd fade like the green herb .
19:37:003:0	Trust in the Lord and do good ; Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness .
19:37:004:0	Delight yourself in the Lord ; And He will give you the desires of your heart .
19:37:005:0	Commit your way to the Lord , Trust also in Him , and He will do it .
19:37:006:0	He will bring forth your righteousness as the lightAnd your judgment as the noonday .
19:37:007:0	Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him ; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way , Because of the man who carries out wicked schemes .
19:37:008:0	Cease from anger and forsake wrath ; Do not fret ; it leads only to evildoing .
19:37:009:0	For evildoers will be cut off , But those who wait for the Lord , they will inherit the land .
19:37:010:0	Yet a little while and the wicked man will be no more ; And you will look carefully for his place and he will not be there .
19:37:011:0	But the humble will inherit the landAnd will delight themselves in abundant prosperity .
19:37:012:0	The wicked plots against the righteousAnd gnashes at him with his teeth .
19:37:013:0	The Lord laughs at him , For He sees his day is coming .
19:37:014:0	The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bowTo cast down the afflicted and the needy , To slay those who are upright in conduct .
19:37:015:0	Their sword will enter their own heart , And their bows will be broken .
19:37:016:0	Better is the little of the righteousThan the abundance of many wicked .
19:37:017:0	For the arms of the wicked will be broken , But the Lord sustains the righteous .
19:37:018:0	The Lord knows the days of the blameless , And their inheritance will be forever .
19:37:019:0	They will not be ashamed in the time of evil , And in the days of famine they will have abundance .
19:37:020:0	But the wicked will perish ; And the enemies of the Lord will be like the glory of the pastures , They vanishâ€”like smoke they vanish away .
19:37:021:0	The wicked borrows and does not pay back , But the righteous is gracious and gives .
19:37:022:0	For those blessed by Him will inherit the land , But those cursed by Him will be cut off .
19:37:023:0	The steps of a man are established by the Lord , And He delights in his way .
19:37:024:0	When he falls , he will not be hurled headlong , Because the Lord is the One who holds his hand .
19:37:025:0	I have been young and now I am old , Yet I have not seen the righteous forsakenOr his descendants begging bread .
19:37:026:0	All day long he is gracious and lends , And his descendants are a blessing .
19:37:027:0	Depart from evil and do good , So you will abide forever .
19:37:028:0	For the Lord loves justiceAnd does not forsake His godly ones ; They are preserved forever , But the descendants of the wicked will be cut off .
19:37:029:0	The righteous will inherit the landAnd dwell in it forever .
19:37:030:0	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom , And his tongue speaks justice .
19:37:031:0	The law of his God is in his heart ; His steps do not slip .
19:37:032:0	The wicked spies upon the righteousAnd seeks to kill him .
19:37:033:0	The Lord will not leave him in his handOr let him be condemned when he is judged .
19:37:034:0	Wait for the Lord and keep His way , And He will exalt you to inherit the land ; When the wicked are cut off , you will see it .
19:37:035:0	I have seen a wicked , violent manSpreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil .
19:37:036:0	Then he passed away , and lo , he was no more ; I sought for him , but he could not be found .
19:37:037:0	Mark the blameless man , and behold the upright ; For the man of peace will have a posterity .
19:37:038:0	But transgressors will be altogether destroyed ; The posterity of the wicked will be cut off .
19:37:039:0	But the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord ; He is their strength in time of trouble .
19:37:040:0	The Lord helps them and delivers them ; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them , Because they take refuge in Him .
