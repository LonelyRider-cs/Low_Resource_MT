19:62:001:1	PSALM 62
19:62:002:1	God Alone a Refuge from Treachery and Oppression .
19:62:003:1	For the choir director ; according to Jeduthun . A Psalm of David .
19:62:001:0	My soul waits in silence for God only ; From Him is my salvation .
19:62:002:0	He only is my rock and my salvation , My stronghold ; I shall not be greatly shaken .
19:62:003:0	How long will you assail a man , That you may murder him , all of you , Like a leaning wall , like a tottering fence ?
19:62:004:0	They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position ; They delight in falsehood ; They bless with their mouth , But inwardly they curse . Selah .
19:62:005:0	My soul , wait in silence for God only , For my hope is from Him .
19:62:006:0	He only is my rock and my salvation , My stronghold ; I shall not be shaken .
19:62:007:0	On God my salvation and my glory rest ; The rock of my strength , my refuge is in God .
19:62:008:0	Trust in Him at all times , O people ; Pour out your heart before Him ; God is a refuge for us . Selah .
19:62:009:0	Men of low degree are only vanity and men of rank are a lie ; In the balances they go up ; They are together lighter than breath .
19:62:010:0	Do not trust in oppressionAnd do not vainly hope in robbery ; If riches increase , do not set your heart upon them .
19:62:011:0	Once God has spoken ; Twice I have heard this : That power belongs to God ;
19:62:012:0	And lovingkindness is Yours , O Lord , For You recompense a man according to his work .
