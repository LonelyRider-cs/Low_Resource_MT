19:24:001:1	PSALM 24
19:24:002:1	The King of Glory Entering Zion .
19:24:003:1	A Psalm of David .
19:24:001:0	The earth is the Lord’s , and all it contains , The world , and those who dwell in it .
19:24:002:0	For He has founded it upon the seasAnd established it upon the rivers .
19:24:003:0	Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord ? And who may stand in His holy place ?
19:24:004:0	He who has clean hands and a pure heart , Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehoodAnd has not sworn deceitfully .
19:24:005:0	He shall receive a blessing from the LordAnd righteousness from the God of his salvation .
19:24:006:0	This is the generation of those who seek Him , Who seek Your face—even Jacob . Selah .
19:24:007:0	Lift up your heads , O gates , And be lifted up , O ancient doors , That the King of glory may come in !
19:24:008:0	Who is the King of glory ? The Lord strong and mighty , The Lord mighty in battle .
19:24:009:0	Lift up your heads , O gates , And lift them up , O ancient doors , That the King of glory may come in !
19:24:010:0	Who is this King of glory ? The Lord of hosts , He is the King of glory . Selah .
