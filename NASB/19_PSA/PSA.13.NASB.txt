19:13:001:1	PSALM 13
19:13:002:1	Prayer for Help in Trouble .
19:13:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:13:001:0	How long , O Lord ? Will You forget me forever ? How long will You hide Your face from me ?
19:13:002:0	How long shall I take counsel in my soul , Having sorrow in my heart all the day ? How long will my enemy be exalted over me ?
19:13:003:0	Consider and answer me , O Lord my God ; Enlighten my eyes , or I will sleep the sleep of death ,
19:13:004:0	And my enemy will say , “ I have overcome him , ” And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken .
19:13:005:0	But I have trusted in Your lovingkindness ; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation .
19:13:006:0	I will sing to the Lord , Because He has dealt bountifully with me .
