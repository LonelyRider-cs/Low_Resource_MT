19:63:001:1	PSALM 63
19:63:002:1	The Thirsting Soul Satisfied in God .
19:63:003:1	A Psalm of David , when he was in the wilderness of Judah .
19:63:001:0	O God , You are my God ; I shall seek You earnestly ; My soul thirsts for You , my flesh yearns for You , In a dry and weary land where there is no water .
19:63:002:0	Thus I have seen You in the sanctuary , To see Your power and Your glory .
19:63:003:0	Because Your lovingkindness is better than life , My lips will praise You .
19:63:004:0	So I will bless You as long as I live ; I will lift up my hands in Your name .
19:63:005:0	My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness , And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips .
19:63:006:0	When I remember You on my bed , I meditate on You in the night watches ,
19:63:007:0	For You have been my help , And in the shadow of Your wings I sing for joy .
19:63:008:0	My soul clings to You ; Your right hand upholds me .
19:63:009:0	But those who seek my life to destroy it , Will go into the depths of the earth .
19:63:010:0	They will be delivered over to the power of the sword ; They will be a prey for foxes .
19:63:011:0	But the king will rejoice in God ; Everyone who swears by Him will glory , For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped .
