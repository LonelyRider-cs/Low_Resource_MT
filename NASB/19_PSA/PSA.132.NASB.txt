19:132:006:1	Blessing upon the Sanctuary .
19:132:007:1	A Song of Ascents .
19:132:001:0	Remember , O Lord , on David’s behalf , All his affliction ;
19:132:002:0	How he swore to the LordAnd vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob ,
19:132:003:0	“ Surely I will not enter my house , Nor lie on my bed ;
19:132:004:0	I will not give sleep to my eyesOr slumber to my eyelids ,
19:132:005:0	Until I find a place for the Lord , A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob . ”
19:132:006:0	Behold , we heard of it in Ephrathah , We found it in the field of Jaar .
19:132:007:0	Let us go into His dwelling place ; Let us worship at His footstool .
19:132:008:0	Arise , O Lord , to Your resting place , You and the ark of Your strength .
19:132:009:0	Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness , And let Your godly ones sing for joy .
19:132:010:0	For the sake of David Your servant , Do not turn away the face of Your anointed .
19:132:011:0	The Lord has sworn to DavidA truth from which He will not turn back : “ Of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne .
19:132:012:0	If your sons will keep My covenantAnd My testimony which I will teach them , Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forever . ”
19:132:013:0	For the Lord has chosen Zion ; He has desired it for His habitation .
19:132:014:0	“ This is My resting place forever ; Here I will dwell , for I have desired it .
19:132:015:0	I will abundantly bless her provision ; I will satisfy her needy with bread .
19:132:016:0	Her priests also I will clothe with salvation , And her godly ones will sing aloud for joy .
19:132:017:0	There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth ; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed .
19:132:018:0	His enemies I will clothe with shame , But upon himself his crown shall shine . ”
