19:11:005:1	For the choir director .
19:11:006:1	A Psalm
19:11:007:1	of David .
19:11:001:0	In the Lord I take refuge ; How can you say to my soul , “ Flee as a bird to your mountain ;
19:11:002:0	For , behold , the wicked bend the bow , They make ready their arrow upon the stringTo shoot in darkness at the upright in heart .
19:11:003:0	If the foundations are destroyed , What can the righteous do ? ”
19:11:004:0	The Lord is in His holy temple ; the Lord’s throne is in heaven ; His eyes behold , His eyelids test the sons of men .
19:11:005:0	The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked , And the one who loves violence His soul hates .
19:11:006:0	Upon the wicked He will rain snares ; Fire and brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup .
19:11:007:0	For the Lord is righteous , He loves righteousness ; The upright will behold His face .
