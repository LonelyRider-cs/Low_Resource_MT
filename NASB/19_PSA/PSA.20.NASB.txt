19:20:006:0	Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed ; He will answer him from His holy heavenWith the saving strength of His right hand .
19:20:007:0	Some boast in chariots and some in horses , But we will boast in the name of the Lord , our God .
19:20:008:0	They have bowed down and fallen , But we have risen and stood upright .
19:20:009:0	Save , O Lord ; May the King answer us in the day we call .
