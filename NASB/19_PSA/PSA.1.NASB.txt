19:1:002:1	PSALM 1
19:1:003:1	The Righteous and the Wicked Contrasted .
19:1:001:0	How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked , Nor stand in the path of sinners , Nor sit in the seat of scoffers !
19:1:002:0	But his delight is in the law of the Lord , And in His law he meditates day and night .
19:1:003:0	He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water , Which yields its fruit in its seasonAnd its leaf does not wither ; And in whatever he does , he prospers .
19:1:004:0	The wicked are not so , But they are like chaff which the wind drives away .
19:1:005:0	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment , Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous .
19:1:006:0	For the Lord knows the way of the righteous , But the way of the wicked will perish .
