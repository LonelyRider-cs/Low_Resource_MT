19:18:006:1	Psalm
19:18:007:1	of David the servant of the L
19:18:008:1	ord
19:18:009:1	, who spoke to the L
19:18:010:1	ord
19:18:011:1	the words of this song in the day that the L
19:18:012:1	ord
19:18:013:1	delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul . And he said ,
19:18:001:0	“ I love You , O Lord , my strength . ”
19:18:002:0	The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer , My God , my rock , in whom I take refuge ; My shield and the horn of my salvation , my stronghold .
19:18:003:0	I call upon the Lord , who is worthy to be praised , And I am saved from my enemies .
19:18:004:0	The cords of death encompassed me , And the torrents of ungodliness terrified me .
19:18:005:0	The cords of Sheol surrounded me ; The snares of death confronted me .
19:18:006:0	In my distress I called upon the Lord , And cried to my God for help ; He heard my voice out of His temple , And my cry for help before Him came into His ears .
19:18:007:0	Then the earth shook and quaked ; And the foundations of the mountains were tremblingAnd were shaken , because He was angry .
19:18:008:0	Smoke went up out of His nostrils , And fire from His mouth devoured ; Coals were kindled by it .
19:18:009:0	He bowed the heavens also , and came downWith thick darkness under His feet .
19:18:010:0	He rode upon a cherub and flew ; And He sped upon the wings of the wind .
19:18:011:0	He made darkness His hiding place , His canopy around Him , Darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
19:18:012:0	From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds , Hailstones and coals of fire .
19:18:013:0	The Lord also thundered in the heavens , And the Most High uttered His voice , Hailstones and coals of fire .
19:18:014:0	He sent out His arrows , and scattered them , And lightning flashes in abundance , and routed them .
19:18:015:0	Then the channels of water appeared , And the foundations of the world were laid bareAt Your rebuke , O Lord , At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils .
19:18:016:0	He sent from on high , He took me ; He drew me out of many waters .
19:18:017:0	He delivered me from my strong enemy , And from those who hated me , for they were too mighty for me .
19:18:018:0	They confronted me in the day of my calamity , But the Lord was my stay .
19:18:019:0	He brought me forth also into a broad place ; He rescued me , because He delighted in me .
19:18:020:0	The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness ; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me .
19:18:021:0	For I have kept the ways of the Lord , And have not wickedly departed from my God .
19:18:022:0	For all His ordinances were before me , And I did not put away His statutes from me .
19:18:023:0	I was also blameless with Him , And I kept myself from my iniquity .
19:18:024:0	Therefore the Lord has recompensed me according to my righteousness , According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes .
19:18:025:0	With the kind You show Yourself kind ; With the blameless You show Yourself blameless ;
19:18:026:0	With the pure You show Yourself pure , And with the crooked You show Yourself astute .
19:18:027:0	For You save an afflicted people , But haughty eyes You abase .
19:18:028:0	For You light my lamp ; The Lord my God illumines my darkness .
19:18:029:0	For by You I can run upon a troop ; And by my God I can leap over a wall .
19:18:030:0	As for God , His way is blameless ; The word of the Lord is tried ; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him .
19:18:031:0	For who is God , but the Lord ? And who is a rock , except our God ,
19:18:032:0	The God who girds me with strengthAnd makes my way blameless ?
19:18:033:0	He makes my feet like hinds’ feet , And sets me upon my high places .
19:18:034:0	He trains my hands for battle , So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze .
19:18:035:0	You have also given me the shield of Your salvation , And Your right hand upholds me ; And Your gentleness makes me great .
19:18:036:0	You enlarge my steps under me , And my feet have not slipped .
19:18:037:0	I pursued my enemies and overtook them , And I did not turn back until they were consumed .
19:18:038:0	I shattered them , so that they were not able to rise ; They fell under my feet .
19:18:039:0	For You have girded me with strength for battle ; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me .
19:18:040:0	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , And I destroyed those who hated me .
19:18:041:0	They cried for help , but there was none to save , Even to the Lord , but He did not answer them .
19:18:042:0	Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind ; I emptied them out as the mire of the streets .
19:18:043:0	You have delivered me from the contentions of the people ; You have placed me as head of the nations ; A people whom I have not known serve me .
19:18:044:0	As soon as they hear , they obey me ; Foreigners submit to me .
19:18:045:0	Foreigners fade away , And come trembling out of their fortresses .
19:18:046:0	The Lord lives , and blessed be my rock ; And exalted be the God of my salvation ,
19:18:047:0	The God who executes vengeance for me , And subdues peoples under me .
19:18:048:0	He delivers me from my enemies ; Surely You lift me above those who rise up against me ; You rescue me from the violent man .
19:18:049:0	Therefore I will give thanks to You among the nations , O Lord , And I will sing praises to Your name .
19:18:050:0	He gives great deliverance to His king , And shows lovingkindness to His anointed , To David and his descendants forever .
