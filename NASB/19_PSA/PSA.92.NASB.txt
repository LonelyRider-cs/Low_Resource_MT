19:92:006:1	Goodness .
19:92:007:1	A Psalm , a Song for the Sabbath day .
19:92:001:0	It is good to give thanks to the LordAnd to sing praises to Your name , O Most High ;
19:92:002:0	To declare Your lovingkindness in the morningAnd Your faithfulness by night ,
19:92:003:0	With the ten-stringed lute and with the harp , With resounding music upon the lyre .
19:92:004:0	For You , O Lord , have made me glad by what You have done , I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands .
19:92:005:0	How great are Your works , O Lord ! Your thoughts are very deep .
19:92:006:0	A senseless man has no knowledge , Nor does a stupid man understand this :
19:92:007:0	That when the wicked sprouted up like grassAnd all who did iniquity flourished , It was only that they might be destroyed forevermore .
19:92:008:0	But You , O Lord , are on high forever .
19:92:009:0	For , behold , Your enemies , O Lord , For , behold , Your enemies will perish ; All who do iniquity will be scattered .
19:92:010:0	But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox ; I have been anointed with fresh oil .
19:92:011:0	And my eye has looked exultantly upon my foes , My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me .
19:92:012:0	The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree , He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon .
19:92:013:0	Planted in the house of the Lord , They will flourish in the courts of our God .
19:92:014:0	They will still yield fruit in old age ; They shall be full of sap and very green ,
19:92:015:0	To declare that the Lord is upright ; He is my rock , and there is no unrighteousness in Him .
