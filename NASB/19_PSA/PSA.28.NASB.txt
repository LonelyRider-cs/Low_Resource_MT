19:28:003:1	
19:28:004:1	A Psalm
19:28:005:1	of David .
19:28:001:0	To You , O Lord , I call ; My rock , do not be deaf to me , For if You are silent to me , I will become like those who go down to the pit .
19:28:002:0	Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to You for help , When I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary .
19:28:003:0	Do not drag me away with the wickedAnd with those who work iniquity , Who speak peace with their neighbors , While evil is in their hearts .
19:28:004:0	Requite them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices ; Requite them according to the deeds of their hands ; Repay them their recompense .
19:28:005:0	Because they do not regard the works of the LordNor the deeds of His hands , He will tear them down and not build them up .
19:28:006:0	Blessed be the Lord , Because He has heard the voice of my supplication .
19:28:007:0	The Lord is my strength and my shield ; My heart trusts in Him , and I am helped ; Therefore my heart exults , And with my song I shall thank Him .
19:28:008:0	The Lord is their strength , And He is a saving defense to His anointed .
19:28:009:0	Save Your people and bless Your inheritance ; Be their shepherd also , and carry them forever .
