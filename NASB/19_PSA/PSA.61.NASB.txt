19:61:001:1	PSALM 61
19:61:002:1	Confidence in God’s Protection .
19:61:003:1	For the choir director ; on a stringed instrument .
19:61:004:1	A Psalm
19:61:005:1	of David .
19:61:001:0	Hear my cry , O God ; Give heed to my prayer .
19:61:002:0	From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint ; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I .
19:61:003:0	For You have been a refuge for me , A tower of strength against the enemy .
19:61:004:0	Let me dwell in Your tent forever ; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings . Selah .
19:61:005:0	For You have heard my vows , O God ; You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name .
19:61:006:0	You will prolong the king’s life ; His years will be as many generations .
19:61:007:0	He will abide before God forever ; Appoint lovingkindness and truth that they may preserve him .
19:61:008:0	So I will sing praise to Your name forever , That I may pay my vows day by day .
