19:7:006:1	I . e . Dithyrambic rhythm ; or wild passionate song
19:7:007:1	Shiggaion of David , which he sang to the L
19:7:008:1	ord
19:7:009:1	concerning Cush , a Benjamite .
19:7:001:0	O Lord my God , in You I have taken refuge ; Save me from all those who pursue me , and deliver me ,
19:7:002:0	Or he will tear my soul like a lion , Dragging me away , while there is none to deliver .
19:7:003:0	O Lord my God , if I have done this , If there is injustice in my hands ,
19:7:004:0	If I have rewarded evil to my friend , Or have plundered him who without cause was my adversary ,
19:7:005:0	Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it ; And let him trample my life down to the groundAnd lay my glory in the dust . Selah .
19:7:006:0	Arise , O Lord , in Your anger ; Lift up Yourself against the rage of my adversaries , And arouse Yourself for me ; You have appointed judgment .
19:7:007:0	Let the assembly of the peoples encompass You , And over them return on high .
19:7:008:0	The Lord judges the peoples ; Vindicate me , O Lord , according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me .
19:7:009:0	O let the evil of the wicked come to an end , but establish the righteous ; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds .
19:7:010:0	My shield is with God , Who saves the upright in heart .
19:7:011:0	God is a righteous judge , And a God who has indignation every day .
19:7:012:0	If a man does not repent , He will sharpen His sword ; He has bent His bow and made it ready .
19:7:013:0	He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons ; He makes His arrows fiery shafts .
19:7:014:0	Behold , he travails with wickedness , And he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood .
19:7:015:0	He has dug a pit and hollowed it out , And has fallen into the hole which he made .
19:7:016:0	His mischief will return upon his own head , And his violence will descend upon his own pate .
19:7:017:0	I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousnessAnd will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High .
