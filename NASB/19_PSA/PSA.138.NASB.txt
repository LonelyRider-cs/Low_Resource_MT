19:138:009:1	of David .
19:138:001:0	I will give You thanks with all my heart ; I will sing praises to You before the gods .
19:138:002:0	I will bow down toward Your holy templeAnd give thanks to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth ; For You have magnified Your word according to all Your name .
19:138:003:0	On the day I called , You answered me ; You made me bold with strength in my soul .
19:138:004:0	All the kings of the earth will give thanks to You , O Lord , When they have heard the words of Your mouth .
19:138:005:0	And they will sing of the ways of the Lord , For great is the glory of the Lord .
19:138:006:0	For though the Lord is exalted , Yet He regards the lowly , But the haughty He knows from afar .
19:138:007:0	Though I walk in the midst of trouble , You will revive me ; You will stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies , And Your right hand will save me .
19:138:008:0	The Lord will accomplish what concerns me ; Your lovingkindness , O Lord , is everlasting ; Do not forsake the works of Your hands .
