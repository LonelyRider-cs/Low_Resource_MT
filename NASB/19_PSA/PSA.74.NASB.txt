19:74:001:1	PSALM 74
19:74:002:1	An Appeal against the Devastation of the Land by the Enemy .
19:74:003:1	A Maskil of Asaph .
19:74:001:0	O God , why have You rejected us forever ? Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture ?
19:74:002:0	Remember Your congregation , which You have purchased of old , Which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your inheritance ; And this Mount Zion , where You have dwelt .
19:74:003:0	Turn Your footsteps toward the perpetual ruins ; The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary .
19:74:004:0	Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place ; They have set up their own standards for signs .
19:74:005:0	It seems as if one had lifted up His axe in a forest of trees .
19:74:006:0	And now all its carved workThey smash with hatchet and hammers .
19:74:007:0	They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground ; They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name .
19:74:008:0	They said in their heart , “ Let us completely subdue them . ” They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land .
19:74:009:0	We do not see our signs ; There is no longer any prophet , Nor is there any among us who knows how long .
19:74:010:0	How long , O God , will the adversary revile , And the enemy spurn Your name forever ?
19:74:011:0	Why do You withdraw Your hand , even Your right hand ? From within Your bosom , destroy them !
19:74:012:0	Yet God is my king from of old , Who works deeds of deliverance in the midst of the earth .
19:74:013:0	You divided the sea by Your strength ; You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters .
19:74:014:0	You crushed the heads of Leviathan ; You gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness .
19:74:015:0	You broke open springs and torrents ; You dried up ever-flowing streams .
19:74:016:0	Yours is the day , Yours also is the night ; You have prepared the light and the sun .
19:74:017:0	You have established all the boundaries of the earth ; You have made summer and winter .
19:74:018:0	Remember this , O Lord , that the enemy has reviled , And a foolish people has spurned Your name .
19:74:019:0	Do not deliver the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast ; Do not forget the life of Your afflicted forever .
19:74:020:0	Consider the covenant ; For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence .
19:74:021:0	Let not the oppressed return dishonored ; Let the afflicted and needy praise Your name .
19:74:022:0	Arise , O God , and plead Your own cause ; Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long .
19:74:023:0	Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries , The uproar of those who rise against You which ascends continually .
