19:35:001:1	PSALM 35
19:35:002:1	Prayer for Rescue from Enemies .
19:35:003:1	
19:35:004:1	A Psalm
19:35:005:1	of David .
19:35:001:0	Contend , O Lord , with those who contend with me ; Fight against those who fight against me .
19:35:002:0	Take hold of buckler and shieldAnd rise up for my help .
19:35:003:0	Draw also the spear and the battle-axe to meet those who pursue me ; Say to my soul , “ I am your salvation . ”
19:35:004:0	Let those be ashamed and dishonored who seek my life ; Let those be turned back and humiliated who devise evil against me .
19:35:005:0	Let them be like chaff before the wind , With the angel of the Lord driving them on .
19:35:006:0	Let their way be dark and slippery , With the angel of the Lord pursuing them .
19:35:007:0	For without cause they hid their net for me ; Without cause they dug a pit for my soul .
19:35:008:0	Let destruction come upon him unawares , And let the net which he hid catch himself ; Into that very destruction let him fall .
19:35:009:0	And my soul shall rejoice in the Lord ; It shall exult in His salvation .
19:35:010:0	All my bones will say , “ Lord , who is like You , Who delivers the afflicted from him who is too strong for him , And the afflicted and the needy from him who robs him ? ”
19:35:011:0	Malicious witnesses rise up ; They ask me of things that I do not know .
19:35:012:0	They repay me evil for good , To the bereavement of my soul .
19:35:013:0	But as for me , when they were sick , my clothing was sackcloth ; I humbled my soul with fasting , And my prayer kept returning to my bosom .
19:35:014:0	I went about as though it were my friend or brother ; I bowed down mourning , as one who sorrows for a mother .
19:35:015:0	But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered themselves together ; The smiters whom I did not know gathered together against me , They slandered me without ceasing .
19:35:016:0	Like godless jesters at a feast , They gnashed at me with their teeth .
19:35:017:0	Lord , how long will You look on ? Rescue my soul from their ravages , My only life from the lions .
19:35:018:0	I will give You thanks in the great congregation ; I will praise You among a mighty throng .
19:35:019:0	Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me ; Nor let those who hate me without cause wink maliciously .
19:35:020:0	For they do not speak peace , But they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land .
19:35:021:0	They opened their mouth wide against me ; They said , “ Aha , aha , our eyes have seen it ! ”
19:35:022:0	You have seen it , O Lord , do not keep silent ; O Lord , do not be far from me .
19:35:023:0	Stir up Yourself , and awake to my rightAnd to my cause , my God and my Lord .
19:35:024:0	Judge me , O Lord my God , according to Your righteousness , And do not let them rejoice over me .
19:35:025:0	Do not let them say in their heart , “ Aha , our desire ! ” Do not let them say , “ We have swallowed him up ! ”
19:35:026:0	Let those be ashamed and humiliated altogether who rejoice at my distress ; Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me .
19:35:027:0	Let them shout for joy and rejoice , who favor my vindication ; And let them say continually , “ The Lord be magnified , Who delights in the prosperity of His servant . ”
19:35:028:0	And my tongue shall declare Your righteousness And Your praise all day long .
