19:57:007:1	Do Not Destroy
19:57:008:1	Al-tashheth . A Mikhtam of David , when he fled from Saul in the cave .
19:57:001:0	Be gracious to me , O God , be gracious to me , For my soul takes refuge in You ; And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refugeUntil destruction passes by .
19:57:002:0	I will cry to God Most High , To God who accomplishes all things for me .
19:57:003:0	He will send from heaven and save me ; He reproaches him who tramples upon me . Selah . God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth .
19:57:004:0	My soul is among lions ; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire , Even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrowsAnd their tongue a sharp sword .
19:57:005:0	Be exalted above the heavens , O God ; Let Your glory be above all the earth .
19:57:006:0	They have prepared a net for my steps ; My soul is bowed down ; They dug a pit before me ; They themselves have fallen into the midst of it . Selah .
19:57:007:0	My heart is steadfast , O God , my heart is steadfast ; I will sing , yes , I will sing praises !
19:57:008:0	Awake , my glory ! Awake , harp and lyre ! I will awaken the dawn .
19:57:009:0	I will give thanks to You , O Lord , among the peoples ; I will sing praises to You among the nations .
19:57:010:0	For Your lovingkindness is great to the heavensAnd Your truth to the clouds .
19:57:011:0	Be exalted above the heavens , O God ; Let Your glory be above all the earth .
