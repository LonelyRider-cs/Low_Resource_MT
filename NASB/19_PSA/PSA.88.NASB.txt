19:88:001:1	PSALM 88
19:88:002:1	A Petition to Be Saved from Death .
19:88:003:1	A Song . A Psalm of the sons of Korah . For the choir director ; according to Mahalath Leannoth . A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite .
19:88:001:0	O Lord , the God of my salvation , I have cried out by day and in the night before You .
19:88:002:0	Let my prayer come before You ; Incline Your ear to my cry !
19:88:003:0	For my soul has had enough troubles , And my life has drawn near to Sheol .
19:88:004:0	I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit ; I have become like a man without strength ,
19:88:005:0	Forsaken among the dead , Like the slain who lie in the grave , Whom You remember no more , And they are cut off from Your hand .
19:88:006:0	You have put me in the lowest pit , In dark places , in the depths .
19:88:007:0	Your wrath has rested upon me , And You have afflicted me with all Your waves . Selah .
19:88:008:0	You have removed my acquaintances far from me ; You have made me an object of loathing to them ; I am shut up and cannot go out .
19:88:009:0	My eye has wasted away because of affliction ; I have called upon You every day , O Lord ; I have spread out my hands to You .
19:88:010:0	Will You perform wonders for the dead ? Will the departed spirits rise and praise You ? Selah .
19:88:011:0	Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave , Your faithfulness in Abaddon ?
19:88:012:0	Will Your wonders be made known in the darkness ? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
19:88:013:0	But I , O Lord , have cried out to You for help , And in the morning my prayer comes before You .
19:88:014:0	O Lord , why do You reject my soul ? Why do You hide Your face from me ?
19:88:015:0	I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on ; I suffer Your terrors ; I am overcome .
19:88:016:0	Your burning anger has passed over me ; Your terrors have destroyed me .
19:88:017:0	They have surrounded me like water all day long ; They have encompassed me altogether .
19:88:018:0	You have removed lover and friend far from me ; My acquaintances are in darkness .
