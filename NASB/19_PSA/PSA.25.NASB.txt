19:25:004:1	A Psalm
19:25:005:1	of David .
19:25:001:0	To You , O Lord , I lift up my soul .
19:25:002:0	O my God , in You I trust , Do not let me be ashamed ; Do not let my enemies exult over me .
19:25:003:0	Indeed , none of those who wait for You will be ashamed ; Those who deal treacherously without cause will be ashamed .
19:25:004:0	Make me know Your ways , O Lord ; Teach me Your paths .
19:25:005:0	Lead me in Your truth and teach me , For You are the God of my salvation ; For You I wait all the day .
19:25:006:0	Remember , O Lord , Your compassion and Your lovingkindnesses , For they have been from of old .
19:25:007:0	Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions ; According to Your lovingkindness remember me , For Your goodness’ sake , O Lord .
19:25:008:0	Good and upright is the Lord ; Therefore He instructs sinners in the way .
19:25:009:0	He leads the humble in justice , And He teaches the humble His way .
19:25:010:0	All the paths of the Lord are lovingkindness and truthTo those who keep His covenant and His testimonies .
19:25:011:0	For Your name’s sake , O Lord , Pardon my iniquity , for it is great .
19:25:012:0	Who is the man who fears the Lord ? He will instruct him in the way he should choose .
19:25:013:0	His soul will abide in prosperity , And his descendants will inherit the land .
19:25:014:0	The secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him , And He will make them know His covenant .
19:25:015:0	My eyes are continually toward the Lord , For He will pluck my feet out of the net .
19:25:016:0	Turn to me and be gracious to me , For I am lonely and afflicted .
19:25:017:0	The troubles of my heart are enlarged ; Bring me out of my distresses .
19:25:018:0	Look upon my affliction and my trouble , And forgive all my sins .
19:25:019:0	Look upon my enemies , for they are many , And they hate me with violent hatred .
19:25:020:0	Guard my soul and deliver me ; Do not let me be ashamed , for I take refuge in You .
19:25:021:0	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me , For I wait for You .
19:25:022:0	Redeem Israel , O God , Out of all his troubles .
