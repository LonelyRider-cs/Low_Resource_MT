19:31:001:1	PSALM 31
19:31:002:1	A Psalm of Complaint and of Praise .
19:31:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:31:001:0	In You , O Lord , I have taken refuge ; Let me never be ashamed ; In Your righteousness deliver me .
19:31:002:0	Incline Your ear to me , rescue me quickly ; Be to me a rock of strength , A stronghold to save me .
19:31:003:0	For You are my rock and my fortress ; For Your name’s sake You will lead me and guide me .
19:31:004:0	You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me , For You are my strength .
19:31:005:0	Into Your hand I commit my spirit ; You have ransomed me , O Lord , God of truth .
19:31:006:0	I hate those who regard vain idols , But I trust in the Lord .
19:31:007:0	I will rejoice and be glad in Your lovingkindness , Because You have seen my affliction ; You have known the troubles of my soul ,
19:31:008:0	And You have not given me over into the hand of the enemy ; You have set my feet in a large place .
19:31:009:0	Be gracious to me , O Lord , for I am in distress ; My eye is wasted away from grief , my soul and my body also .
19:31:010:0	For my life is spent with sorrowAnd my years with sighing ; My strength has failed because of my iniquity , And my body has wasted away .
19:31:011:0	Because of all my adversaries , I have become a reproach , Especially to my neighbors , And an object of dread to my acquaintances ; Those who see me in the street flee from me .
19:31:012:0	I am forgotten as a dead man , out of mind ; I am like a broken vessel .
19:31:013:0	For I have heard the slander of many , Terror is on every side ; While they took counsel together against me , They schemed to take away my life .
19:31:014:0	But as for me , I trust in You , O Lord , I say , “ You are my God . ”
19:31:015:0	My times are in Your hand ; Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me .
19:31:016:0	Make Your face to shine upon Your servant ; Save me in Your lovingkindness .
19:31:017:0	Let me not be put to shame , O Lord , for I call upon You ; Let the wicked be put to shame , let them be silent in Sheol .
19:31:018:0	Let the lying lips be mute , Which speak arrogantly against the righteousWith pride and contempt .
19:31:019:0	How great is Your goodness , Which You have stored up for those who fear You , Which You have wrought for those who take refuge in You , Before the sons of men !
19:31:020:0	You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the conspiracies of man ; You keep them secretly in a shelter from the strife of tongues .
19:31:021:0	Blessed be the Lord , For He has made marvelous His lovingkindness to me in a besieged city .
19:31:022:0	As for me , I said in my alarm , “ I am cut off from before Your eyes ” ; Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplicationsWhen I cried to You .
19:31:023:0	O love the Lord , all you His godly ones ! The Lord preserves the faithfulAnd fully recompenses the proud doer .
19:31:024:0	Be strong and let your heart take courage , All you who hope in the Lord .
