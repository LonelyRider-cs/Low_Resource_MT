19:76:001:1	PSALM 76
19:76:002:1	The Victorious Power of the God of Jacob .
19:76:003:1	For the choir director ; on stringed instruments . A Psalm of Asaph , a Song .
19:76:001:0	God is known in Judah ; His name is great in Israel .
19:76:002:0	His tabernacle is in Salem ; His dwelling place also is in Zion .
19:76:003:0	There He broke the flaming arrows , The shield and the sword and the weapons of war . Selah .
19:76:004:0	You are resplendent , More majestic than the mountains of prey .
19:76:005:0	The stouthearted were plundered , They sank into sleep ; And none of the warriors could use his hands .
19:76:006:0	At Your rebuke , O God of Jacob , Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep .
19:76:007:0	You , even You , are to be feared ; And who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry ?
19:76:008:0	You caused judgment to be heard from heaven ; The earth feared and was still
19:76:009:0	When God arose to judgment , To save all the humble of the earth . Selah .
19:76:010:0	For the wrath of man shall praise You ; With a remnant of wrath You will gird Yourself .
19:76:011:0	Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them ; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared .
19:76:012:0	He will cut off the spirit of princes ; He is feared by the kings of the earth .
