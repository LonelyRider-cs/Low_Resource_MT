19:118:002:0	Oh let Israel say , “ His lovingkindness is everlasting . ”
19:118:003:0	Oh let the house of Aaron say , “ His lovingkindness is everlasting . ”
19:118:004:0	Oh let those who fear the Lord say , “ His lovingkindness is everlasting . ”
19:118:005:0	From my distress I called upon the Lord ; The Lord answered me and set me in a large place .
19:118:006:0	The Lord is for me ; I will not fear ; What can man do to me ?
19:118:007:0	The Lord is for me among those who help me ; Therefore I will look with satisfaction on those who hate me .
19:118:008:0	It is better to take refuge in the LordThan to trust in man .
19:118:009:0	It is better to take refuge in the LordThan to trust in princes .
19:118:010:0	All nations surrounded me ; In the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off .
19:118:011:0	They surrounded me , yes , they surrounded me ; In the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off .
19:118:012:0	They surrounded me like bees ; They were extinguished as a fire of thorns ; In the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off .
19:118:013:0	You pushed me violently so that I was falling , But the Lord helped me .
19:118:014:0	The Lord is my strength and song , And He has become my salvation .
19:118:015:0	The sound of joyful shouting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous ; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly .
19:118:016:0	The right hand of the Lord is exalted ; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly .
19:118:017:0	I will not die , but live , And tell of the works of the Lord .
19:118:018:0	The Lord has disciplined me severely , But He has not given me over to death .
19:118:019:0	Open to me the gates of righteousness ; I shall enter through them , I shall give thanks to the Lord .
19:118:020:0	This is the gate of the Lord ; The righteous will enter through it .
19:118:021:0	I shall give thanks to You , for You have answered me , And You have become my salvation .
19:118:022:0	The stone which the builders rejectedHas become the chief corner stone .
19:118:023:0	This is the Lord’s doing ; It is marvelous in our eyes .
19:118:024:0	This is the day which the Lord has made ; Let us rejoice and be glad in it .
19:118:025:0	O Lord , do save , we beseech You ; O Lord , we beseech You , do send prosperity !
19:118:026:0	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ; We have blessed you from the house of the Lord .
19:118:027:0	The Lord is God , and He has given us light ; Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar .
19:118:028:0	You are my God , and I give thanks to You ; You are my God , I extol You .
19:118:029:0	Give thanks to the Lord , for He is good ; For His lovingkindness is everlasting .
