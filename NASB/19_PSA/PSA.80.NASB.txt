19:80:001:1	PSALM 80
19:80:002:1	God Implored to Rescue His People from Their Calamities .
19:80:003:1	For the choir director ;
19:80:004:1	set to
19:80:005:1	El Shoshannim ; Eduth . A Psalm of Asaph .
19:80:001:0	Oh , give ear , Shepherd of Israel , You who lead Joseph like a flock ; You who are enthroned above the cherubim , shine forth !
19:80:002:0	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh , stir up Your powerAnd come to save us !
19:80:003:0	O God , restore usAnd cause Your face to shine upon us , and we will be saved .
19:80:004:0	O Lord God of hosts , How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your people ?
19:80:005:0	You have fed them with the bread of tears , And You have made them to drink tears in large measure .
19:80:006:0	You make us an object of contention to our neighbors , And our enemies laugh among themselves .
19:80:007:0	O God of hosts , restore usAnd cause Your face to shine upon us , and we will be saved .
19:80:008:0	You removed a vine from Egypt ; You drove out the nations and planted it .
19:80:009:0	You cleared the ground before it , And it took deep root and filled the land .
19:80:010:0	The mountains were covered with its shadow , And the cedars of God with its boughs .
19:80:011:0	It was sending out its branches to the seaAnd its shoots to the River .
19:80:012:0	Why have You broken down its hedges , So that all who pass that way pick its fruit ?
19:80:013:0	A boar from the forest eats it awayAnd whatever moves in the field feeds on it .
19:80:014:0	O God of hosts , turn again now , we beseech You ; Look down from heaven and see , and take care of this vine ,
19:80:015:0	Even the shoot which Your right hand has planted , And on the son whom You have strengthened for Yourself .
19:80:016:0	It is burned with fire , it is cut down ; They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance .
19:80:017:0	Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand , Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself .
19:80:018:0	Then we shall not turn back from You ; Revive us , and we will call upon Your name .
19:80:019:0	O Lord God of hosts , restore us ; Cause Your face to shine upon us , and we will be saved .
