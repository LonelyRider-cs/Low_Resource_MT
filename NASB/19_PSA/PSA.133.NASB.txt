19:133:001:1	PSALM 133
19:133:002:1	The Excellency of Brotherly Unity .
19:133:003:1	A Song of Ascents , of David .
19:133:001:0	Behold , how good and how pleasant it isFor brothers to dwell together in unity !
19:133:002:0	It is like the precious oil upon the head , Coming down upon the beard , Even Aaron’s beard , Coming down upon the edge of his robes .
19:133:003:0	It is like the dew of HermonComing down upon the mountains of Zion ; For there the Lord commanded the blessing—life forever .
