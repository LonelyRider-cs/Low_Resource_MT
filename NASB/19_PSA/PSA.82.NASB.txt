19:82:001:1	PSALM 82
19:82:002:1	Unjust Judgments Rebuked .
19:82:003:1	A Psalm of Asaph .
19:82:001:0	God takes His stand in His own congregation ; He judges in the midst of the rulers .
19:82:002:0	How long will you judge unjustlyAnd show partiality to the wicked ? Selah .
19:82:003:0	Vindicate the weak and fatherless ; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute .
19:82:004:0	Rescue the weak and needy ; Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked .
19:82:005:0	They do not know nor do they understand ; They walk about in darkness ; All the foundations of the earth are shaken .
19:82:006:0	I said , “ You are gods , And all of you are sons of the Most High .
19:82:007:0	Nevertheless you will die like menAnd fall like any one of the princes . ”
19:82:008:0	Arise , O God , judge the earth ! For it is You who possesses all the nations .
