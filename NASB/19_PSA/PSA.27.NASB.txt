19:27:003:1	
19:27:004:1	A Psalm
19:27:005:1	of David .
19:27:001:0	The Lord is my light and my salvation ; Whom shall I fear ? The Lord is the defense of my life ; Whom shall I dread ?
19:27:002:0	When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh , My adversaries and my enemies , they stumbled and fell .
19:27:003:0	Though a host encamp against me , My heart will not fear ; Though war arise against me , In spite of this I shall be confident .
19:27:004:0	One thing I have asked from the Lord , that I shall seek : That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life , To behold the beauty of the LordAnd to meditate in His temple .
19:27:005:0	For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle ; In the secret place of His tent He will hide me ; He will lift me up on a rock .
19:27:006:0	And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me , And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy ; I will sing , yes , I will sing praises to the Lord .
19:27:007:0	Hear , O Lord , when I cry with my voice , And be gracious to me and answer me .
19:27:008:0	When You said , “ Seek My face , ” my heart said to You , “ Your face , O Lord , I shall seek . ”
19:27:009:0	Do not hide Your face from me , Do not turn Your servant away in anger ; You have been my help ; Do not abandon me nor forsake me , O God of my salvation !
19:27:010:0	For my father and my mother have forsaken me , But the Lord will take me up .
19:27:011:0	Teach me Your way , O Lord , And lead me in a level pathBecause of my foes .
19:27:012:0	Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries , For false witnesses have risen against me , And such as breathe out violence .
19:27:013:0	I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LordIn the land of the living .
19:27:014:0	Wait for the Lord ; Be strong and let your heart take courage ; Yes , wait for the Lord .
