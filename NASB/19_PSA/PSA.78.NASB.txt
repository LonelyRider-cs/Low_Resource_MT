19:78:001:1	PSALM 78
19:78:002:1	God’s Guidance of His People in Spite of Their Unfaithfulness .
19:78:003:1	A Maskil of Asaph .
19:78:001:0	Listen , O my people , to my instruction ; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
19:78:002:0	I will open my mouth in a parable ; I will utter dark sayings of old ,
19:78:003:0	Which we have heard and known , And our fathers have told us .
19:78:004:0	We will not conceal them from their children , But tell to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , And His strength and His wondrous works that He has done .
19:78:005:0	For He established a testimony in JacobAnd appointed a law in Israel , Which He commanded our fathersThat they should teach them to their children ,
19:78:006:0	That the generation to come might know , even the children yet to be born , That they may arise and tell them to their children ,
19:78:007:0	That they should put their confidence in GodAnd not forget the works of God , But keep His commandments ,
19:78:008:0	And not be like their fathers , A stubborn and rebellious generation , A generation that did not prepare its heartAnd whose spirit was not faithful to God .
19:78:009:0	The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows , Yet they turned back in the day of battle .
19:78:010:0	They did not keep the covenant of GodAnd refused to walk in His law ;
19:78:011:0	They forgot His deedsAnd His miracles that He had shown them .
19:78:012:0	He wrought wonders before their fathersIn the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
19:78:013:0	He divided the sea and caused them to pass through , And He made the waters stand up like a heap .
19:78:014:0	Then He led them with the cloud by dayAnd all the night with a light of fire .
19:78:015:0	He split the rocks in the wildernessAnd gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths .
19:78:016:0	He brought forth streams also from the rockAnd caused waters to run down like rivers .
19:78:017:0	Yet they still continued to sin against Him , To rebel against the Most High in the desert .
19:78:018:0	And in their heart they put God to the testBy asking food according to their desire .
19:78:019:0	Then they spoke against God ; They said , “ Can God prepare a table in the wilderness ?
19:78:020:0	Behold , He struck the rock so that waters gushed out , And streams were overflowing ; Can He give bread also ? Will He provide meat for His people ? ”
19:78:021:0	Therefore the Lord heard and was full of wrath ; And a fire was kindled against JacobAnd anger also mounted against Israel ,
19:78:022:0	Because they did not believe in GodAnd did not trust in His salvation .
19:78:023:0	Yet He commanded the clouds aboveAnd opened the doors of heaven ;
19:78:024:0	He rained down manna upon them to eatAnd gave them food from heaven .
19:78:025:0	Man did eat the bread of angels ; He sent them food in abundance .
19:78:026:0	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavensAnd by His power He directed the south wind .
19:78:027:0	When He rained meat upon them like the dust , Even winged fowl like the sand of the seas ,
19:78:028:0	Then He let them fall in the midst of their camp , Round about their dwellings .
19:78:029:0	So they ate and were well filled , And their desire He gave to them .
19:78:030:0	Before they had satisfied their desire , While their food was in their mouths ,
19:78:031:0	The anger of God rose against themAnd killed some of their stoutest ones , And subdued the choice men of Israel .
19:78:032:0	In spite of all this they still sinnedAnd did not believe in His wonderful works .
19:78:033:0	So He brought their days to an end in futilityAnd their years in sudden terror .
19:78:034:0	When He killed them , then they sought Him , And returned and searched diligently for God ;
19:78:035:0	And they remembered that God was their rock , And the Most High God their Redeemer .
19:78:036:0	But they deceived Him with their mouthAnd lied to Him with their tongue .
19:78:037:0	For their heart was not steadfast toward Him , Nor were they faithful in His covenant .
19:78:038:0	But He , being compassionate , forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them ; And often He restrained His angerAnd did not arouse all His wrath .
19:78:039:0	Thus He remembered that they were but flesh , A wind that passes and does not return .
19:78:040:0	How often they rebelled against Him in the wildernessAnd grieved Him in the desert !
19:78:041:0	Again and again they tempted God , And pained the Holy One of Israel .
19:78:042:0	They did not remember His power , The day when He redeemed them from the adversary ,
19:78:043:0	When He performed His signs in EgyptAnd His marvels in the field of Zoan ,
19:78:044:0	And turned their rivers to blood , And their streams , they could not drink .
19:78:045:0	He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them , And frogs which destroyed them .
19:78:046:0	He gave also their crops to the grasshopperAnd the product of their labor to the locust .
19:78:047:0	He destroyed their vines with hailstonesAnd their sycamore trees with frost .
19:78:048:0	He gave over their cattle also to the hailstonesAnd their herds to bolts of lightning .
19:78:049:0	He sent upon them His burning anger , Fury and indignation and trouble , A band of destroying angels .
19:78:050:0	He leveled a path for His anger ; He did not spare their soul from death , But gave over their life to the plague ,
19:78:051:0	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt , The first issue of their virility in the tents of Ham .
19:78:052:0	But He led forth His own people like sheepAnd guided them in the wilderness like a flock ;
19:78:053:0	He led them safely , so that they did not fear ; But the sea engulfed their enemies .
19:78:054:0	So He brought them to His holy land , To this hill country which His right hand had gained .
19:78:055:0	He also drove out the nations before themAnd apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement , And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents .
19:78:056:0	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High GodAnd did not keep His testimonies ,
19:78:057:0	But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers ; They turned aside like a treacherous bow .
19:78:058:0	For they provoked Him with their high placesAnd aroused His jealousy with their graven images .
19:78:059:0	When God heard , He was filled with wrathAnd greatly abhorred Israel ;
19:78:060:0	So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh , The tent which He had pitched among men ,
19:78:061:0	And gave up His strength to captivityAnd His glory into the hand of the adversary .
19:78:062:0	He also delivered His people to the sword , And was filled with wrath at His inheritance .
19:78:063:0	Fire devoured His young men , And His virgins had no wedding songs .
19:78:064:0	His priests fell by the sword , And His widows could not weep .
19:78:065:0	Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep , Like a warrior overcome by wine .
19:78:066:0	He drove His adversaries backward ; He put on them an everlasting reproach .
19:78:067:0	He also rejected the tent of Joseph , And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim ,
19:78:068:0	But chose the tribe of Judah , Mount Zion which He loved .
19:78:069:0	And He built His sanctuary like the heights , Like the earth which He has founded forever .
19:78:070:0	He also chose David His servantAnd took him from the sheepfolds ;
19:78:071:0	From the care of the ewes with suckling lambs He brought himTo shepherd Jacob His people , And Israel His inheritance .
19:78:072:0	So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart , And guided them with his skillful hands .
