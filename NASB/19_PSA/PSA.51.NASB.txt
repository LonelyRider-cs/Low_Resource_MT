19:51:001:1	PSALM 51
19:51:002:1	A Contrite Sinnerâ€™s Prayer for Pardon .
19:51:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David , when Nathan the prophet came to him , after he had gone in to Bathsheba .
19:51:001:0	Be gracious to me , O God , according to Your lovingkindness ; According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions .
19:51:002:0	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquityAnd cleanse me from my sin .
19:51:003:0	For I know my transgressions , And my sin is ever before me .
19:51:004:0	Against You , You only , I have sinnedAnd done what is evil in Your sight , So that You are justified when You speakAnd blameless when You judge .
19:51:005:0	Behold , I was brought forth in iniquity , And in sin my mother conceived me .
19:51:006:0	Behold , You desire truth in the innermost being , And in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom .
19:51:007:0	Purify me with hyssop , and I shall be clean ; Wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow .
19:51:008:0	Make me to hear joy and gladness , Let the bones which You have broken rejoice .
19:51:009:0	Hide Your face from my sinsAnd blot out all my iniquities .
19:51:010:0	Create in me a clean heart , O God , And renew a steadfast spirit within me .
19:51:011:0	Do not cast me away from Your presenceAnd do not take Your Holy Spirit from me .
19:51:012:0	Restore to me the joy of Your salvationAnd sustain me with a willing spirit .
19:51:013:0	Then I will teach transgressors Your ways , And sinners will be converted to You .
19:51:014:0	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness , O God , the God of my salvation ; Then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness .
19:51:015:0	O Lord , open my lips , That my mouth may declare Your praise .
19:51:016:0	For You do not delight in sacrifice , otherwise I would give it ; You are not pleased with burnt offering .
19:51:017:0	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit ; A broken and a contrite heart , O God , You will not despise .
19:51:018:0	By Your favor do good to Zion ; Build the walls of Jerusalem .
19:51:019:0	Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices , In burnt offering and whole burnt offering ; Then young bulls will be offered on Your altar .
