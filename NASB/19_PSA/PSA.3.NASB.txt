19:3:001:1	PSALM 3
19:3:002:1	Morning Prayer of Trust in God .
19:3:003:1	A Psalm of David , when he fled from Absalom his son .
19:3:001:0	O Lord , how my adversaries have increased ! Many are rising up against me .
19:3:002:0	Many are saying of my soul , “ There is no deliverance for him in God . ” Selah .
19:3:003:0	But You , O Lord , are a shield about me , My glory , and the One who lifts my head .
19:3:004:0	I was crying to the Lord with my voice , And He answered me from His holy mountain . Selah .
19:3:005:0	I lay down and slept ; I awoke , for the Lord sustains me .
19:3:006:0	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of peopleWho have set themselves against me round about .
19:3:007:0	Arise , O Lord ; save me , O my God ! For You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek ; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked .
19:3:008:0	Salvation belongs to the Lord ; Your blessing be upon Your people ! Selah .
