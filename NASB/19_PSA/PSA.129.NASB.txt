19:129:001:1	PSALM 129
19:129:002:1	Prayer for the Overthrow of Zion’s Enemies .
19:129:003:1	A Song of Ascents .
19:129:001:0	“ Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up , ” Let Israel now say ,
19:129:002:0	“ Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up ; Yet they have not prevailed against me .
19:129:003:0	The plowers plowed upon my back ; They lengthened their furrows . ”
19:129:004:0	The Lord is righteous ; He has cut in two the cords of the wicked .
19:129:005:0	May all who hate ZionBe put to shame and turned backward ;
19:129:006:0	Let them be like grass upon the housetops , Which withers before it grows up ;
19:129:007:0	With which the reaper does not fill his hand , Or the binder of sheaves his bosom ;
19:129:008:0	Nor do those who pass by say , “ The blessing of the Lord be upon you ; We bless you in the name of the Lord . ”
