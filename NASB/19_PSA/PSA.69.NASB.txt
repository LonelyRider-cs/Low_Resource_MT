19:69:001:1	PSALM 69
19:69:002:1	A Cry of Distress and Imprecation on Adversaries .
19:69:003:1	For the choir director ; according to
19:69:004:1	Or possibly
19:69:005:1	Lilies
19:69:006:1	Shoshannim .
19:69:007:1	A Psalm
19:69:008:1	of David .
19:69:001:0	Save me , O God , For the waters have threatened my life .
19:69:002:0	I have sunk in deep mire , and there is no foothold ; I have come into deep waters , and a flood overflows me .
19:69:003:0	I am weary with my crying ; my throat is parched ; My eyes fail while I wait for my God .
19:69:004:0	Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head ; Those who would destroy me are powerful , being wrongfully my enemies ; What I did not steal , I then have to restore .
19:69:005:0	O God , it is You who knows my folly , And my wrongs are not hidden from You .
19:69:006:0	May those who wait for You not be ashamed through me , O Lord God of hosts ; May those who seek You not be dishonored through me , O God of Israel ,
19:69:007:0	Because for Your sake I have borne reproach ; Dishonor has covered my face .
19:69:008:0	I have become estranged from my brothersAnd an alien to my motherâ€™s sons .
19:69:009:0	For zeal for Your house has consumed me , And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me .
19:69:010:0	When I wept in my soul with fasting , It became my reproach .
19:69:011:0	When I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them .
19:69:012:0	Those who sit in the gate talk about me , And I am the song of the drunkards .
19:69:013:0	But as for me , my prayer is to You , O Lord , at an acceptable time ; O God , in the greatness of Your lovingkindness , Answer me with Your saving truth .
19:69:014:0	Deliver me from the mire and do not let me sink ; May I be delivered from my foes and from the deep waters .
19:69:015:0	May the flood of water not overflow meNor the deep swallow me up , Nor the pit shut its mouth on me .
19:69:016:0	Answer me , O Lord , for Your lovingkindness is good ; According to the greatness of Your compassion , turn to me ,
19:69:017:0	And do not hide Your face from Your servant , For I am in distress ; answer me quickly .
19:69:018:0	Oh draw near to my soul and redeem it ; Ransom me because of my enemies !
19:69:019:0	You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor ; All my adversaries are before You .
19:69:020:0	Reproach has broken my heart and I am so sick . And I looked for sympathy , but there was none , And for comforters , but I found none .
19:69:021:0	They also gave me gall for my foodAnd for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink .
19:69:022:0	May their table before them become a snare ; And when they are in peace , may it become a trap .
19:69:023:0	May their eyes grow dim so that they cannot see , And make their loins shake continually .
19:69:024:0	Pour out Your indignation on them , And may Your burning anger overtake them .
19:69:025:0	May their camp be desolate ; May none dwell in their tents .
19:69:026:0	For they have persecuted him whom You Yourself have smitten , And they tell of the pain of those whom You have wounded .
19:69:027:0	Add iniquity to their iniquity , And may they not come into Your righteousness .
19:69:028:0	May they be blotted out of the book of lifeAnd may they not be recorded with the righteous .
19:69:029:0	But I am afflicted and in pain ; May Your salvation , O God , set me securely on high .
19:69:030:0	I will praise the name of God with songAnd magnify Him with thanksgiving .
19:69:031:0	And it will please the Lord better than an ox Or a young bull with horns and hoofs .
19:69:032:0	The humble have seen it and are glad ; You who seek God , let your heart revive .
19:69:033:0	For the Lord hears the needyAnd does not despise His who are prisoners .
19:69:034:0	Let heaven and earth praise Him , The seas and everything that moves in them .
19:69:035:0	For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah , That they may dwell there and possess it .
19:69:036:0	The descendants of His servants will inherit it , And those who love His name will dwell in it .
