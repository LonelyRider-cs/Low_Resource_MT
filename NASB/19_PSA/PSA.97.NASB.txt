19:97:010:0	Hate evil , you who love the Lord , Who preserves the souls of His godly ones ; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked .
19:97:011:0	Light is sown like seed for the righteousAnd gladness for the upright in heart .
19:97:012:0	Be glad in the Lord , you righteous ones , And give thanks to His holy name .
