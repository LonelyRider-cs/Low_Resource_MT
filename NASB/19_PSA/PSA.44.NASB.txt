19:44:001:1	PSALM 44
19:44:002:1	Former Deliverances and Present Troubles .
19:44:003:1	For the choir director . A Maskil of the sons of Korah .
19:44:001:0	O God , we have heard with our ears , Our fathers have told usThe work that You did in their days , In the days of old .
19:44:002:0	You with Your own hand drove out the nations ; Then You planted them ; You afflicted the peoples , Then You spread them abroad .
19:44:003:0	For by their own sword they did not possess the land , And their own arm did not save them , But Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence , For You favored them .
19:44:004:0	You are my King , O God ; Command victories for Jacob .
19:44:005:0	Through You we will push back our adversaries ; Through Your name we will trample down those who rise up against us .
19:44:006:0	For I will not trust in my bow , Nor will my sword save me .
19:44:007:0	But You have saved us from our adversaries , And You have put to shame those who hate us .
19:44:008:0	In God we have boasted all day long , And we will give thanks to Your name forever . Selah .
19:44:009:0	Yet You have rejected us and brought us to dishonor , And do not go out with our armies .
19:44:010:0	You cause us to turn back from the adversary ; And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves .
19:44:011:0	You give us as sheep to be eatenAnd have scattered us among the nations .
19:44:012:0	You sell Your people cheaply , And have not profited by their sale .
19:44:013:0	You make us a reproach to our neighbors , A scoffing and a derision to those around us .
19:44:014:0	You make us a byword among the nations , A laughingstock among the peoples .
19:44:015:0	All day long my dishonor is before meAnd my humiliation has overwhelmed me ,
19:44:016:0	Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles , Because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger .
19:44:017:0	All this has come upon us , but we have not forgotten You , And we have not dealt falsely with Your covenant .
19:44:018:0	Our heart has not turned back , And our steps have not deviated from Your way ,
19:44:019:0	Yet You have crushed us in a place of jackalsAnd covered us with the shadow of death .
19:44:020:0	If we had forgotten the name of our GodOr extended our hands to a strange god ,
19:44:021:0	Would not God find this out ? For He knows the secrets of the heart .
19:44:022:0	But for Your sake we are killed all day long ; We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered .
19:44:023:0	Arouse Yourself , why do You sleep , O Lord ? Awake , do not reject us forever .
19:44:024:0	Why do You hide Your face And forget our affliction and our oppression ?
19:44:025:0	For our soul has sunk down into the dust ; Our body cleaves to the earth .
19:44:026:0	Rise up , be our help , And redeem us for the sake of Your lovingkindness .
