19:71:001:1	PSALM 71
19:71:002:1	Prayer of an Old Man for Deliverance .
19:71:001:0	In You , O Lord , I have taken refuge ; Let me never be ashamed .
19:71:002:0	In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me ; Incline Your ear to me and save me .
19:71:003:0	Be to me a rock of habitation to which I may continually come ; You have given commandment to save me , For You are my rock and my fortress .
19:71:004:0	Rescue me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , Out of the grasp of the wrongdoer and ruthless man ,
19:71:005:0	For You are my hope ; O Lord God , You are my confidence from my youth .
19:71:006:0	By You I have been sustained from my birth ; You are He who took me from my mother’s womb ; My praise is continually of You .
19:71:007:0	I have become a marvel to many , For You are my strong refuge .
19:71:008:0	My mouth is filled with Your praiseAnd with Your glory all day long .
19:71:009:0	Do not cast me off in the time of old age ; Do not forsake me when my strength fails .
19:71:010:0	For my enemies have spoken against me ; And those who watch for my life have consulted together ,
19:71:011:0	Saying , “ God has forsaken him ; Pursue and seize him , for there is no one to deliver . ”
19:71:012:0	O God , do not be far from me ; O my God , hasten to my help !
19:71:013:0	Let those who are adversaries of my soul be ashamed and consumed ; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor , who seek to injure me .
19:71:014:0	But as for me , I will hope continually , And will praise You yet more and more .
19:71:015:0	My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness And of Your salvation all day long ; For I do not know the sum of them .
19:71:016:0	I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord God ; I will make mention of Your righteousness , Yours alone .
19:71:017:0	O God , You have taught me from my youth , And I still declare Your wondrous deeds .
19:71:018:0	And even when I am old and gray , O God , do not forsake me , Until I declare Your strength to this generation , Your power to all who are to come .
19:71:019:0	For Your righteousness , O God , reaches to the heavens , You who have done great things ; O God , who is like You ?
19:71:020:0	You who have shown me many troubles and distressesWill revive me again , And will bring me up again from the depths of the earth .
19:71:021:0	May You increase my greatnessAnd turn to comfort me .
19:71:022:0	I will also praise You with a harp , Even Your truth , O my God ; To You I will sing praises with the lyre , O Holy One of Israel .
19:71:023:0	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You ; And my soul , which You have redeemed .
19:71:024:0	My tongue also will utter Your righteousness all day long ; For they are ashamed , for they are humiliated who seek my hurt .
