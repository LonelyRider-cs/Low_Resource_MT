19:79:001:1	PSALM 79
19:79:002:1	A Lament over the Destruction of Jerusalem , and Prayer for Help .
19:79:003:1	A Psalm of Asaph .
19:79:001:0	O God , the nations have invaded Your inheritance ; They have defiled Your holy temple ; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins .
19:79:002:0	They have given the dead bodies of Your servants for food to the birds of the heavens , The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth .
19:79:003:0	They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem ; And there was no one to bury them .
19:79:004:0	We have become a reproach to our neighbors , A scoffing and derision to those around us .
19:79:005:0	How long , O Lord ? Will You be angry forever ? Will Your jealousy burn like fire ?
19:79:006:0	Pour out Your wrath upon the nations which do not know You , And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Your name .
19:79:007:0	For they have devoured JacobAnd laid waste his habitation .
19:79:008:0	Do not remember the iniquities of our forefathers against us ; Let Your compassion come quickly to meet us , For we are brought very low .
19:79:009:0	Help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of Your name ; And deliver us and forgive our sins for Your name’s sake .
19:79:010:0	Why should the nations say , “ Where is their God ? ” Let there be known among the nations in our sight , Vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been shed .
19:79:011:0	Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You ; According to the greatness of Your power preserve those who are doomed to die .
19:79:012:0	And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosomThe reproach with which they have reproached You , O Lord .
19:79:013:0	So we Your people and the sheep of Your pastureWill give thanks to You forever ; To all generations we will tell of Your praise .
