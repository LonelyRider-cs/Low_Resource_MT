19:45:001:1	PSALM 45
19:45:002:1	A Song Celebrating the King’s Marriage .
19:45:003:1	For the choir director ; according to the
19:45:004:1	Or possibly
19:45:005:1	Lilies
19:45:006:1	Shoshannim . A Maskil of the sons of Korah . A Song of Love .
19:45:001:0	My heart overflows with a good theme ; I address my verses to the King ; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer .
19:45:002:0	You are fairer than the sons of men ; Grace is poured upon Your lips ; Therefore God has blessed You forever .
19:45:003:0	Gird Your sword on Your thigh , O Mighty One , In Your splendor and Your majesty !
19:45:004:0	And in Your majesty ride on victoriously , For the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness ; Let Your right hand teach You awesome things .
19:45:005:0	Your arrows are sharp ; The peoples fall under You ; Your arrows are in the heart of the King’s enemies .
19:45:006:0	Your throne , O God , is forever and ever ; A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom .
19:45:007:0	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness ; Therefore God , Your God , has anointed YouWith the oil of joy above Your fellows .
19:45:008:0	All Your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia ; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made You glad .
19:45:009:0	Kings’ daughters are among Your noble ladies ; At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir .
19:45:010:0	Listen , O daughter , give attention and incline your ear : Forget your people and your father’s house ;
19:45:011:0	Then the King will desire your beauty . Because He is your Lord , bow down to Him .
19:45:012:0	The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift ; The rich among the people will seek your favor .
19:45:013:0	The King’s daughter is all glorious within ; Her clothing is interwoven with gold .
19:45:014:0	She will be led to the King in embroidered work ; The virgins , her companions who follow her , Will be brought to You .
19:45:015:0	They will be led forth with gladness and rejoicing ; They will enter into the King’s palace .
19:45:016:0	In place of your fathers will be your sons ; You shall make them princes in all the earth .
19:45:017:0	I will cause Your name to be remembered in all generations ; Therefore the peoples will give You thanks forever and ever .
