19:109:001:1	PSALM 109
19:109:002:1	Vengeance Invoked upon Adversaries .
19:109:003:1	For the choir director . A Psalm of David .
19:109:001:0	O God of my praise , Do not be silent !
19:109:002:0	For they have opened the wicked and deceitful mouth against me ; They have spoken against me with a lying tongue .
19:109:003:0	They have also surrounded me with words of hatred , And fought against me without cause .
19:109:004:0	In return for my love they act as my accusers ; But I am in prayer .
19:109:005:0	Thus they have repaid me evil for goodAnd hatred for my love .
19:109:006:0	Appoint a wicked man over him , And let an accuser stand at his right hand .
19:109:007:0	When he is judged , let him come forth guilty , And let his prayer become sin .
19:109:008:0	Let his days be few ; Let another take his office .
19:109:009:0	Let his children be fatherlessAnd his wife a widow .
19:109:010:0	Let his children wander about and beg ; And let them seek sustenance far from their ruined homes .
19:109:011:0	Let the creditor seize all that he has , And let strangers plunder the product of his labor .
19:109:012:0	Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him , Nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children .
19:109:013:0	Let his posterity be cut off ; In a following generation let their name be blotted out .
19:109:014:0	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord , And do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out .
19:109:015:0	Let them be before the Lord continually , That He may cut off their memory from the earth ;
19:109:016:0	Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness , But persecuted the afflicted and needy man , And the despondent in heart , to put them to death .
19:109:017:0	He also loved cursing , so it came to him ; And he did not delight in blessing , so it was far from him .
19:109:018:0	But he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment , And it entered into his body like waterAnd like oil into his bones .
19:109:019:0	Let it be to him as a garment with which he covers himself , And for a belt with which he constantly girds himself .
19:109:020:0	Let this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord , And of those who speak evil against my soul .
19:109:021:0	But You , O God , the Lord , deal kindly with me for Your nameâ€™s sake ; Because Your lovingkindness is good , deliver me ;
19:109:022:0	For I am afflicted and needy , And my heart is wounded within me .
19:109:023:0	I am passing like a shadow when it lengthens ; I am shaken off like the locust .
19:109:024:0	My knees are weak from fasting , And my flesh has grown lean , without fatness .
19:109:025:0	I also have become a reproach to them ; When they see me , they wag their head .
19:109:026:0	Help me , O Lord my God ; Save me according to Your lovingkindness .
19:109:027:0	And let them know that this is Your hand ; You , Lord , have done it .
19:109:028:0	Let them curse , but You bless ; When they arise , they shall be ashamed , But Your servant shall be glad .
19:109:029:0	Let my accusers be clothed with dishonor , And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe .
19:109:030:0	With my mouth I will give thanks abundantly to the Lord ; And in the midst of many I will praise Him .
19:109:031:0	For He stands at the right hand of the needy , To save him from those who judge his soul .
