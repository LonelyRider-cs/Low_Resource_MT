19:12:001:1	PSALM 12
19:12:002:1	God , a Helper against the Treacherous .
19:12:003:1	For the choir director ; upon an eight-stringed lyre . A Psalm of David .
19:12:001:0	Help , Lord , for the godly man ceases to be , For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men .
19:12:002:0	They speak falsehood to one another ; With flattering lips and with a double heart they speak .
19:12:003:0	May the Lord cut off all flattering lips , The tongue that speaks great things ;
19:12:004:0	Who have said , “ With our tongue we will prevail ; Our lips are our own ; who is lord over us ? ”
19:12:005:0	“ Because of the devastation of the afflicted , because of the groaning of the needy , Now I will arise , ” says the Lord ; “ I will set him in the safety for which he longs . ”
19:12:006:0	The words of the Lord are pure words ; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth , refined seven times .
19:12:007:0	You , O Lord , will keep them ; You will preserve him from this generation forever .
19:12:008:0	The wicked strut about on every sideWhen vileness is exalted among the sons of men .
