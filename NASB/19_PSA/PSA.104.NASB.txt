19:104:006:1	Care over All His Works .
19:104:001:0	Bless the Lord , O my soul ! O Lord my God , You are very great ; You are clothed with splendor and majesty ,
19:104:002:0	Covering Yourself with light as with a cloak , Stretching out heaven like a tent curtain .
19:104:003:0	He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters ; He makes the clouds His chariot ; He walks upon the wings of the wind ;
19:104:004:0	He makes the winds His messengers , Flaming fire His ministers .
19:104:005:0	He established the earth upon its foundations , So that it will not totter forever and ever .
19:104:006:0	You covered it with the deep as with a garment ; The waters were standing above the mountains .
19:104:007:0	At Your rebuke they fled , At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away .
19:104:008:0	The mountains rose ; the valleys sank downTo the place which You established for them .
19:104:009:0	You set a boundary that they may not pass over , So that they will not return to cover the earth .
19:104:010:0	He sends forth springs in the valleys ; They flow between the mountains ;
19:104:011:0	They give drink to every beast of the field ; The wild donkeys quench their thirst .
19:104:012:0	Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell ; They lift up their voices among the branches .
19:104:013:0	He waters the mountains from His upper chambers ; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works .
19:104:014:0	He causes the grass to grow for the cattle , And vegetation for the labor of man , So that he may bring forth food from the earth ,
19:104:015:0	And wine which makes man’s heart glad , So that he may make his face glisten with oil , And food which sustains man’s heart .
19:104:016:0	The trees of the Lord drink their fill , The cedars of Lebanon which He planted ,
19:104:017:0	Where the birds build their nests , And the stork , whose home is the fir trees .
19:104:018:0	The high mountains are for the wild goats ; The cliffs are a refuge for the shephanim .
19:104:019:0	He made the moon for the seasons ; The sun knows the place of its setting .
19:104:020:0	You appoint darkness and it becomes night , In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about .
19:104:021:0	The young lions roar after their preyAnd seek their food from God .
19:104:022:0	When the sun rises they withdrawAnd lie down in their dens .
19:104:023:0	Man goes forth to his workAnd to his labor until evening .
19:104:024:0	O Lord , how many are Your works ! In wisdom You have made them all ; The earth is full of Your possessions .
19:104:025:0	There is the sea , great and broad , In which are swarms without number , Animals both small and great .
19:104:026:0	There the ships move along , And Leviathan , which You have formed to sport in it .
19:104:027:0	They all wait for YouTo give them their food in due season .
19:104:028:0	You give to them , they gather it up ; You open Your hand , they are satisfied with good .
19:104:029:0	You hide Your face , they are dismayed ; You take away their spirit , they expireAnd return to their dust .
19:104:030:0	You send forth Your Spirit , they are created ; And You renew the face of the ground .
19:104:031:0	Let the glory of the Lord endure forever ; Let the Lord be glad in His works ;
19:104:032:0	He looks at the earth , and it trembles ; He touches the mountains , and they smoke .
19:104:033:0	I will sing to the Lord as long as I live ; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being .
19:104:034:0	Let my meditation be pleasing to Him ; As for me , I shall be glad in the Lord .
19:104:035:0	Let sinners be consumed from the earthAnd let the wicked be no more . Bless the Lord , O my soul . Praise the Lord !
