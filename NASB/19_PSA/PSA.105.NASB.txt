19:105:006:1	Wonderful Works in Behalf of Israel .
19:105:001:0	Oh give thanks to the Lord , call upon His name ; Make known His deeds among the peoples .
19:105:002:0	Sing to Him , sing praises to Him ; Speak of all His wonders .
19:105:003:0	Glory in His holy name ; Let the heart of those who seek the Lord be glad .
19:105:004:0	Seek the Lord and His strength ; Seek His face continually .
19:105:005:0	Remember His wonders which He has done , His marvels and the judgments uttered by His mouth ,
19:105:006:0	O seed of Abraham , His servant , O sons of Jacob , His chosen ones !
19:105:007:0	He is the Lord our God ; His judgments are in all the earth .
19:105:008:0	He has remembered His covenant forever , The word which He commanded to a thousand generations ,
19:105:009:0	The covenant which He made with Abraham , And His oath to Isaac .
19:105:010:0	Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute , To Israel as an everlasting covenant ,
19:105:011:0	Saying , “ To you I will give the land of CanaanAs the portion of your inheritance , ”
19:105:012:0	When they were only a few men in number , Very few , and strangers in it .
19:105:013:0	And they wandered about from nation to nation , From one kingdom to another people .
19:105:014:0	He permitted no man to oppress them , And He reproved kings for their sakes :
19:105:015:0	“ Do not touch My anointed ones , And do My prophets no harm . ”
19:105:016:0	And He called for a famine upon the land ; He broke the whole staff of bread .
19:105:017:0	He sent a man before them , Joseph , who was sold as a slave .
19:105:018:0	They afflicted his feet with fetters , He himself was laid in irons ;
19:105:019:0	Until the time that his word came to pass , The word of the Lord tested him .
19:105:020:0	The king sent and released him , The ruler of peoples , and set him free .
19:105:021:0	He made him lord of his houseAnd ruler over all his possessions ,
19:105:022:0	To imprison his princes at will , That he might teach his elders wisdom .
19:105:023:0	Israel also came into Egypt ; Thus Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham .
19:105:024:0	And He caused His people to be very fruitful , And made them stronger than their adversaries .
19:105:025:0	He turned their heart to hate His people , To deal craftily with His servants .
19:105:026:0	He sent Moses His servant , And Aaron , whom He had chosen .
19:105:027:0	They performed His wondrous acts among them , And miracles in the land of Ham .
19:105:028:0	He sent darkness and made it dark ; And they did not rebel against His words .
19:105:029:0	He turned their waters into bloodAnd caused their fish to die .
19:105:030:0	Their land swarmed with frogs Even in the chambers of their kings .
19:105:031:0	He spoke , and there came a swarm of flies And gnats in all their territory .
19:105:032:0	He gave them hail for rain , And flaming fire in their land .
19:105:033:0	He struck down their vines also and their fig trees , And shattered the trees of their territory .
19:105:034:0	He spoke , and locusts came , And young locusts , even without number ,
19:105:035:0	And ate up all vegetation in their land , And ate up the fruit of their ground .
19:105:036:0	He also struck down all the firstborn in their land , The first fruits of all their vigor .
19:105:037:0	Then He brought them out with silver and gold , And among His tribes there was not one who stumbled .
19:105:038:0	Egypt was glad when they departed , For the dread of them had fallen upon them .
19:105:039:0	He spread a cloud for a covering , And fire to illumine by night .
19:105:040:0	They asked , and He brought quail , And satisfied them with the bread of heaven .
19:105:041:0	He opened the rock and water flowed out ; It ran in the dry places like a river .
19:105:042:0	For He remembered His holy word With Abraham His servant ;
19:105:043:0	And He brought forth His people with joy , His chosen ones with a joyful shout .
19:105:044:0	He gave them also the lands of the nations , That they might take possession of the fruit of the peoples’ labor ,
19:105:045:0	So that they might keep His statutesAnd observe His laws , Praise the Lord !
