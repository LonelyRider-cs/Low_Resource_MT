19:46:005:0	God is in the midst of her , she will not be moved ; God will help her when morning dawns .
19:46:006:0	The nations made an uproar , the kingdoms tottered ; He raised His voice , the earth melted .
19:46:007:0	The Lord of hosts is with us ; The God of Jacob is our stronghold . Selah .
19:46:008:0	Come , behold the works of the Lord , Who has wrought desolations in the earth .
19:46:009:0	He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth ; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two ; He burns the chariots with fire .
19:46:010:0	“ Cease striving and know that I am God ; I will be exalted among the nations , I will be exalted in the earth . ”
19:46:011:0	The Lord of hosts is with us ; The God of Jacob is our stronghold . Selah .
