19:38:001:1	PSALM 38
19:38:002:1	Prayer of a Suffering Penitent .
19:38:003:1	A Psalm of David , for a memorial .
19:38:001:0	O Lord , rebuke me not in Your wrath , And chasten me not in Your burning anger .
19:38:002:0	For Your arrows have sunk deep into me , And Your hand has pressed down on me .
19:38:003:0	There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation ; There is no health in my bones because of my sin .
19:38:004:0	For my iniquities are gone over my head ; As a heavy burden they weigh too much for me .
19:38:005:0	My wounds grow foul and festerBecause of my folly .
19:38:006:0	I am bent over and greatly bowed down ; I go mourning all day long .
19:38:007:0	For my loins are filled with burning , And there is no soundness in my flesh .
19:38:008:0	I am benumbed and badly crushed ; I groan because of the agitation of my heart .
19:38:009:0	Lord , all my desire is before You ; And my sighing is not hidden from You .
19:38:010:0	My heart throbs , my strength fails me ; And the light of my eyes , even that has gone from me .
19:38:011:0	My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague ; And my kinsmen stand afar off .
19:38:012:0	Those who seek my life lay snares for me ; And those who seek to injure me have threatened destruction , And they devise treachery all day long .
19:38:013:0	But I , like a deaf man , do not hear ; And I am like a mute man who does not open his mouth .
19:38:014:0	Yes , I am like a man who does not hear , And in whose mouth are no arguments .
19:38:015:0	For I hope in You , O Lord ; You will answer , O Lord my God .
19:38:016:0	For I said , “ May they not rejoice over me , Who , when my foot slips , would magnify themselves against me . ”
19:38:017:0	For I am ready to fall , And my sorrow is continually before me .
19:38:018:0	For I confess my iniquity ; I am full of anxiety because of my sin .
19:38:019:0	But my enemies are vigorous and strong , And many are those who hate me wrongfully .
19:38:020:0	And those who repay evil for good , They oppose me , because I follow what is good .
19:38:021:0	Do not forsake me , O Lord ; O my God , do not be far from me !
19:38:022:0	Make haste to help me , O Lord , my salvation !
