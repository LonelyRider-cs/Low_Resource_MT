28:8:001:1	Israel Reaps the Whirlwind
28:8:001:0	Put the trumpet to your lips ! Like an eagle the enemy comes against the house of the Lord , Because they have transgressed My covenantAnd rebelled against My law .
28:8:002:0	They cry out to Me , “ My God , we of Israel know You ! ”
28:8:003:0	Israel has rejected the good ; The enemy will pursue him .
28:8:004:0	They have set up kings , but not by Me ; They have appointed princes , but I did not know it . With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves , That they might be cut off .
28:8:005:0	He has rejected your calf , O Samaria , saying , “ My anger burns against them ! ” How long will they be incapable of innocence ?
28:8:006:0	For from Israel is even this ! A craftsman made it , so it is not God ; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces .
28:8:007:0	For they sow the windAnd they reap the whirlwind . The standing grain has no heads ; It yields no grain . Should it yield , strangers would swallow it up .
28:8:008:0	Israel is swallowed up ; They are now among the nationsLike a vessel in which no one delights .
28:8:009:0	For they have gone up to Assyria , Like a wild donkey all alone ; Ephraim has hired lovers .
28:8:010:0	Even though they hire allies among the nations , Now I will gather them up ; And they will begin to diminishBecause of the burden of the king of princes .
28:8:011:0	Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin , They have become altars of sinning for him .
28:8:012:0	Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My law , They are regarded as a strange thing .
28:8:013:0	As for My sacrificial gifts , They sacrifice the flesh and eat it , But the Lord has taken no delight in them . Now He will remember their iniquity , And punish them for their sins ; They will return to Egypt .
28:8:014:0	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces ; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities , But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings .
