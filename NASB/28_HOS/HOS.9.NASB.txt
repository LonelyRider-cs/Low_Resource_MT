28:9:001:1	Ephraim Punished
28:9:001:0	Do not rejoice , O Israel , with exultation like the nations ! For you have played the harlot , forsaking your God . You have loved harlots’ earnings on every threshing floor .
28:9:002:0	Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them , And the new wine will fail them .
28:9:003:0	They will not remain in the Lord’s land , But Ephraim will return to Egypt , And in Assyria they will eat unclean food .
28:9:004:0	They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the Lord , Their sacrifices will not please Him . Their bread will be like mourners’ bread ; All who eat of it will be defiled , For their bread will be for themselves alone ; It will not enter the house of the Lord .
28:9:005:0	What will you do on the day of the appointed festivalAnd on the day of the feast of the Lord ?
28:9:006:0	For behold , they will go because of destruction ; Egypt will gather them up , Memphis will bury them . Weeds will take over their treasures of silver ; Thorns will be in their tents .
28:9:007:0	The days of punishment have come , The days of retribution have come ; Let Israel know this ! The prophet is a fool , The inspired man is demented , Because of the grossness of your iniquity , And because your hostility is so great .
28:9:008:0	Ephraim was a watchman with my God , a prophet ; Yet the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways , And there is only hostility in the house of his God .
28:9:009:0	They have gone deep in depravityAs in the days of Gibeah ; He will remember their iniquity , He will punish their sins .
28:9:010:0	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness ; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season . But they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame , And they became as detestable as that which they loved .
28:9:011:0	As for Ephraim , their glory will fly away like a bird—No birth , no pregnancy and no conception !
28:9:012:0	Though they bring up their children , Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left . Yes , woe to them indeed when I depart from them !
28:9:013:0	Ephraim , as I have seen , Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre ; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter .
28:9:014:0	Give them , O Lord—what will You give ? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
28:9:015:0	All their evil is at Gilgal ; Indeed , I came to hate them there ! Because of the wickedness of their deedsI will drive them out of My house ! I will love them no more ; All their princes are rebels .
28:9:016:0	Ephraim is stricken , their root is dried up , They will bear no fruit . Even though they bear children , I will slay the precious ones of their womb .
28:9:017:0	My God will cast them awayBecause they have not listened to Him ; And they will be wanderers among the nations .
