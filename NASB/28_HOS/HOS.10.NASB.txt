28:10:001:1	Retribution for Israel’s Sin
28:10:001:0	Israel is a luxuriant vine ; He produces fruit for himself . The more his fruit , The more altars he made ; The richer his land , The better he made the sacred pillars .
28:10:002:0	Their heart is faithless ; Now they must bear their guilt . The Lord will break down their altars And destroy their sacred pillars .
28:10:003:0	Surely now they will say , “ We have no king , For we do not revere the Lord . As for the king , what can he do for us ? ”
28:10:004:0	They speak mere words , With worthless oaths they make covenants ; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field .
28:10:005:0	The inhabitants of Samaria will fearFor the calf of Beth-aven . Indeed , its people will mourn for it , And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it , Over its glory , since it has departed from it .
28:10:006:0	The thing itself will be carried to AssyriaAs tribute to King Jareb ; Ephraim will be seized with shameAnd Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel .
28:10:007:0	Samaria will be cut off with her kingLike a stick on the surface of the water .
28:10:008:0	Also the high places of Aven , the sin of Israel , will be destroyed ; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars ; Then they will say to the mountains , “ Cover us ! ” And to the hills , “ Fall on us ! ”
28:10:009:0	From the days of Gibeah you have sinned , O Israel ; There they stand ! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah ?
28:10:010:0	When it is My desire , I will chastise them ; And the peoples will be gathered against themWhen they are bound for their double guilt .
28:10:011:0	Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh , But I will come over her fair neck with a yoke ; I will harness Ephraim , Judah will plow , Jacob will harrow for himself .
28:10:012:0	Sow with a view to righteousness , Reap in accordance with kindness ; Break up your fallow ground , For it is time to seek the LordUntil He comes to rain righteousness on you .
28:10:013:0	You have plowed wickedness , you have reaped injustice , You have eaten the fruit of lies . Because you have trusted in your way , in your numerous warriors ,
28:10:014:0	Therefore a tumult will arise among your people , And all your fortresses will be destroyed , As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle , When mothers were dashed in pieces with their children .
28:10:015:0	Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness . At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off .
