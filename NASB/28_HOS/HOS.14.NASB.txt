28:14:001:1	Israel’s Future Blessing
28:14:001:0	Return , O Israel , to the Lord your God , For you have stumbled because of your iniquity .
28:14:002:0	Take words with you and return to the Lord . Say to Him , “ Take away all iniquityAnd receive us graciously , That we may present the fruit of our lips .
28:14:003:0	Assyria will not save us , We will not ride on horses ; Nor will we say again , ‘Our god , ’To the work of our hands ; For in You the orphan finds mercy . ”
28:14:004:0	I will heal their apostasy , I will love them freely , For My anger has turned away from them .
28:14:005:0	I will be like the dew to Israel ; He will blossom like the lily , And he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon .
28:14:006:0	His shoots will sprout , And his beauty will be like the olive treeAnd his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon .
28:14:007:0	Those who live in his shadowWill again raise grain , And they will blossom like the vine . His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon .
28:14:008:0	O Ephraim , what more have I to do with idols ? It is I who answer and look after you . I am like a luxuriant cypress ; From Me comes your fruit .
28:14:009:0	Whoever is wise , let him understand these things ; Whoever is discerning , let him know them . For the ways of the Lord are right , And the righteous will walk in them , But transgressors will stumble in them .
