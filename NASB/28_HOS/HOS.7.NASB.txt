28:7:001:1	Ephraimâ€™s Iniquity
28:7:001:0	When I would heal Israel , The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered , And the evil deeds of Samaria , For they deal falsely ; The thief enters in , Bandits raid outside ,
28:7:002:0	And they do not consider in their heartsThat I remember all their wickedness . Now their deeds are all around them ; They are before My face .
28:7:003:0	With their wickedness they make the king glad , And the princes with their lies .
28:7:004:0	They are all adulterers , Like an oven heated by the bakerWho ceases to stir up the fireFrom the kneading of the dough until it is leavened .
28:7:005:0	On the day of our king , the princes became sick with the heat of wine ; He stretched out his hand with scoffers ,
28:7:006:0	For their hearts are like an oven As they approach their plotting ; Their anger smolders all night , In the morning it burns like a flaming fire .
28:7:007:0	All of them are hot like an oven , And they consume their rulers ; All their kings have fallen . None of them calls on Me .
28:7:008:0	Ephraim mixes himself with the nations ; Ephraim has become a cake not turned .
28:7:009:0	Strangers devour his strength , Yet he does not know it ; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him , Yet he does not know it .
28:7:010:0	Though the pride of Israel testifies against him , Yet they have not returned to the Lord their God , Nor have they sought Him , for all this .
28:7:011:0	So Ephraim has become like a silly dove , without sense ; They call to Egypt , they go to Assyria .
28:7:012:0	When they go , I will spread My net over them ; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly .
28:7:013:0	Woe to them , for they have strayed from Me ! Destruction is theirs , for they have rebelled against Me ! I would redeem them , but they speak lies against Me .
28:7:014:0	And they do not cry to Me from their heartWhen they wail on their beds ; For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves , They turn away from Me .
28:7:015:0	Although I trained and strengthened their arms , Yet they devise evil against Me .
28:7:016:0	They turn , but not upward , They are like a deceitful bow ; Their princes will fall by the swordBecause of the insolence of their tongue . This will be their derision in the land of Egypt .
