28:11:001:1	God Yearns over His People
28:11:001:0	When Israel was a youth I loved him , And out of Egypt I called My son .
28:11:002:0	The more they called them , The more they went from them ; They kept sacrificing to the BaalsAnd burning incense to idols .
28:11:003:0	Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk , I took them in My arms ; But they did not know that I healed them .
28:11:004:0	I led them with cords of a man , with bonds of love , And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws ; And I bent down and fed them .
28:11:005:0	They will not return to the land of Egypt ; But Assyriaâ€”he will be their kingBecause they refused to return to Me .
28:11:006:0	The sword will whirl against their cities , And will demolish their gate barsAnd consume them because of their counsels .
28:11:007:0	So My people are bent on turning from Me . Though they call them to the One on high , None at all exalts Him .
28:11:008:0	How can I give you up , O Ephraim ? How can I surrender you , O Israel ? How can I make you like Admah ? How can I treat you like Zeboiim ? My heart is turned over within Me , All My compassions are kindled .
28:11:009:0	I will not execute My fierce anger ; I will not destroy Ephraim again . For I am God and not man , the Holy One in your midst , And I will not come in wrath .
28:11:010:0	They will walk after the Lord , He will roar like a lion ; Indeed He will roarAnd His sons will come trembling from the west .
28:11:011:0	They will come trembling like birds from EgyptAnd like doves from the land of Assyria ; And I will settle them in their houses , declares the Lord .
28:11:012:0	Ephraim surrounds Me with liesAnd the house of Israel with deceit ; Judah is also unruly against God , Even against the Holy One who is faithful .
