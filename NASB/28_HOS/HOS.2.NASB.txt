28:2:001:1	Israel’s Unfaithfulness Condemned
28:2:001:0	Say to your brothers , “ Ammi , ” and to your sisters , “ Ruhamah . ”
28:2:002:0	“ Contend with your mother , contend , For she is not my wife , and I am not her husband ; And let her put away her harlotry from her faceAnd her adultery from between her breasts ,
28:2:003:0	Or I will strip her nakedAnd expose her as on the day when she was born . I will also make her like a wilderness , Make her like desert landAnd slay her with thirst .
28:2:004:0	Also , I will have no compassion on her children , Because they are children of harlotry .
28:2:005:0	For their mother has played the harlot ; She who conceived them has acted shamefully . For she said , ‘I will go after my lovers , Who give me my bread and my water , My wool and my flax , my oil and my drink . ’
28:2:006:0	Therefore , behold , I will hedge up her way with thorns , And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths .
28:2:007:0	She will pursue her lovers , but she will not overtake them ; And she will seek them , but will not find them . Then she will say , ‘I will go back to my first husband , For it was better for me then than now ! ’
28:2:008:0	“ For she does not know that it was I who gave her the grain , the new wine and the oil , And lavished on her silver and gold , Which they used for Baal .
28:2:009:0	Therefore , I will take back My grain at harvest timeAnd My new wine in its season . I will also take away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness .
28:2:010:0	And then I will uncover her lewdnessIn the sight of her lovers , And no one will rescue her out of My hand .
28:2:011:0	I will also put an end to all her gaiety , Her feasts , her new moons , her sabbathsAnd all her festal assemblies .
28:2:012:0	I will destroy her vines and fig trees , Of which she said , ‘These are my wagesWhich my lovers have given me . ’And I will make them a forest , And the beasts of the field will devour them .
28:2:002:1	Restoration of Israel
28:2:013:0	I will punish her for the days of the BaalsWhen she used to offer sacrifices to themAnd adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry , And follow her lovers , so that she forgot Me , ” declares the Lord .
28:2:014:0	“ Therefore , behold , I will allure her , Bring her into the wildernessAnd speak kindly to her .
28:2:015:0	Then I will give her her vineyards from there , And the valley of Achor as a door of hope . And she will sing there as in the days of her youth , As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt .
28:2:016:0	It will come about in that day , ” declares the Lord , “ That you will call Me IshiAnd will no longer call Me Baali .
28:2:017:0	For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth , So that they will be mentioned by their names no more .
28:2:018:0	In that day I will also make a covenant for themWith the beasts of the field , The birds of the skyAnd the creeping things of the ground . And I will abolish the bow , the sword and war from the land , And will make them lie down in safety .
28:2:019:0	I will betroth you to Me forever ; Yes , I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice , In lovingkindness and in compassion ,
28:2:020:0	And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness . Then you will know the Lord .
28:2:021:0	“ It will come about in that day that I will respond , ” declares the Lord . “ I will respond to the heavens , and they will respond to the earth ,
28:2:022:0	And the earth will respond to the grain , to the new wine and to the oil , And they will respond to Jezreel .
28:2:023:0	I will sow her for Myself in the land . I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion , And I will say to those who were not My people , ‘You are My people ! ’And they will say , ‘You are my God ! ’ ”
