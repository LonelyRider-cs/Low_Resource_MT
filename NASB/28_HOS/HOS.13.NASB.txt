28:13:001:1	Ephraim’s Idolatry
28:13:001:0	When Ephraim spoke , there was trembling . He exalted himself in Israel , But through Baal he did wrong and died .
28:13:002:0	And now they sin more and more , And make for themselves molten images , Idols skillfully made from their silver , All of them the work of craftsmen . They say of them , “ Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves ! ”
28:13:003:0	Therefore they will be like the morning cloudAnd like dew which soon disappears , Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floorAnd like smoke from a chimney .
28:13:004:0	Yet I have been the Lord your GodSince the land of Egypt ; And you were not to know any god except Me , For there is no savior besides Me .
28:13:005:0	I cared for you in the wilderness , In the land of drought .
28:13:006:0	As they had their pasture , they became satisfied , And being satisfied , their heart became proud ; Therefore they forgot Me .
28:13:007:0	So I will be like a lion to them ; Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside .
28:13:008:0	I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs , And I will tear open their chests ; There I will also devour them like a lioness , As a wild beast would tear them .
28:13:009:0	It is your destruction , O Israel , That you are against Me , against your help .
28:13:010:0	Where now is your kingThat he may save you in all your cities , And your judges of whom you requested , “ Give me a king and princes ” ?
28:13:011:0	I gave you a king in My angerAnd took him away in My wrath .
28:13:012:0	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up ; His sin is stored up .
28:13:013:0	The pains of childbirth come upon him ; He is not a wise son , For it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb .
28:13:014:0	Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol ? Shall I redeem them from death ? O Death , where are your thorns ? O Sheol , where is your sting ? Compassion will be hidden from My sight .
28:13:015:0	Though he flourishes among the reeds , An east wind will come , The wind of the Lord coming up from the wilderness ; And his fountain will become dryAnd his spring will be dried up ; It will plunder his treasury of every precious article .
28:13:016:0	Samaria will be held guilty , For she has rebelled against her God . They will fall by the sword , Their little ones will be dashed in pieces , And their pregnant women will be ripped open .
