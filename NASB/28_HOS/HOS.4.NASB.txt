28:4:001:1	God’s Controversy with Israel
28:4:001:0	Listen to the word of the Lord , O sons of Israel , For the Lord has a case against the inhabitants of the land , Because there is no faithfulness or kindnessOr knowledge of God in the land .
28:4:002:0	There is swearing , deception , murder , stealing and adultery . They employ violence , so that bloodshed follows bloodshed .
28:4:003:0	Therefore the land mourns , And everyone who lives in it languishesAlong with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky , And also the fish of the sea disappear .
28:4:004:0	Yet let no one find fault , and let none offer reproof ; For your people are like those who contend with the priest .
28:4:005:0	So you will stumble by day , And the prophet also will stumble with you by night ; And I will destroy your mother .
28:4:006:0	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . Because you have rejected knowledge , I also will reject you from being My priest . Since you have forgotten the law of your God , I also will forget your children .
28:4:007:0	The more they multiplied , the more they sinned against Me ; I will change their glory into shame .
28:4:008:0	They feed on the sin of My peopleAnd direct their desire toward their iniquity .
28:4:009:0	And it will be , like people , like priest ; So I will punish them for their waysAnd repay them for their deeds .
28:4:010:0	They will eat , but not have enough ; They will play the harlot , but not increase , Because they have stopped giving heed to the Lord .
28:4:011:0	Harlotry , wine and new wine take away the understanding .
28:4:012:0	My people consult their wooden idol , and their diviner’s wand informs them ; For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray , And they have played the harlot , departing from their God .
28:4:013:0	They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountainsAnd burn incense on the hills , Under oak , poplar and terebinth , Because their shade is pleasant . Therefore your daughters play the harlotAnd your brides commit adultery .
28:4:014:0	I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlotOr your brides when they commit adultery , For the men themselves go apart with harlotsAnd offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes ; So the people without understanding are ruined .
28:4:015:0	Though you , Israel , play the harlot , Do not let Judah become guilty ; Also do not go to Gilgal , Or go up to Beth-avenAnd take the oath : “ As the Lord lives ! ”
28:4:016:0	Since Israel is stubbornLike a stubborn heifer , Can the Lord now pasture themLike a lamb in a large field ?
28:4:017:0	Ephraim is joined to idols ; Let him alone .
28:4:018:0	Their liquor gone , They play the harlot continually ; Their rulers dearly love shame .
28:4:019:0	The wind wraps them in its wings , And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices .
