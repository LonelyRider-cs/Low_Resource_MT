28:3:001:1	Hosea’s Second Symbolic Marriage
28:3:001:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Go again , love a woman who is loved by her husband , yet an adulteress , even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel , though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes . ”
28:3:002:0	So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley .
28:3:003:0	Then I said to her , “ You shall stay with me for many days . You shall not play the harlot , nor shall you have a man ; so I will also be toward you . ”
28:3:004:0	For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince , without sacrifice or sacred pillar and without ephod or household idols .
28:3:005:0	Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king ; and they will come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days .
