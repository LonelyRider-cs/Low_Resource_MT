28:5:001:1	The People’s Apostasy Rebuked
28:5:001:0	Hear this , O priests ! Give heed , O house of Israel ! Listen , O house of the king ! For the judgment applies to you , For you have been a snare at MizpahAnd a net spread out on Tabor .
28:5:002:0	The revolters have gone deep in depravity , But I will chastise all of them .
28:5:003:0	I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hidden from Me ; For now , O Ephraim , you have played the harlot , Israel has defiled itself .
28:5:004:0	Their deeds will not allow themTo return to their God . For a spirit of harlotry is within them , And they do not know the Lord .
28:5:005:0	Moreover , the pride of Israel testifies against him , And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity ; Judah also has stumbled with them .
28:5:006:0	They will go with their flocks and herdsTo seek the Lord , but they will not find Him ; He has withdrawn from them .
28:5:007:0	They have dealt treacherously against the Lord , For they have borne illegitimate children . Now the new moon will devour them with their land .
28:5:008:0	Blow the horn in Gibeah , The trumpet in Ramah . Sound an alarm at Beth-aven : “ Behind you , Benjamin ! ”
28:5:009:0	Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke ; Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is sure .
28:5:010:0	The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary ; On them I will pour out My wrath like water .
28:5:011:0	Ephraim is oppressed , crushed in judgment , Because he was determined to follow man’s command .
28:5:012:0	Therefore I am like a moth to EphraimAnd like rottenness to the house of Judah .
28:5:013:0	When Ephraim saw his sickness , And Judah his wound , Then Ephraim went to AssyriaAnd sent to King Jareb . But he is unable to heal you , Or to cure you of your wound .
28:5:014:0	For I will be like a lion to EphraimAnd like a young lion to the house of Judah . I , even I , will tear to pieces and go away , I will carry away , and there will be none to deliver .
28:5:015:0	I will go away and return to My placeUntil they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face ; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me .
