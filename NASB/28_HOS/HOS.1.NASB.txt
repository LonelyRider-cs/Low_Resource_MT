28:1:001:1	Hosea’s Wife and Children
28:1:001:0	The word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri , during the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
28:1:002:0	When the Lord first spoke through Hosea , the Lord said to Hosea , “ Go , take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry ; for the land commits flagrant harlotry , forsaking the Lord . ”
28:1:003:0	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim , and she conceived and bore him a son .
28:1:004:0	And the Lord said to him , “ Name him Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel , and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel .
28:1:005:0	On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . ”
28:1:006:0	Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter . And the Lord said to him , “ Name her Lo-ruhamah , for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel , that I would ever forgive them .
28:1:007:0	But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the Lord their God , and will not deliver them by bow , sword , battle , horses or horsemen . ”
28:1:008:0	When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah , she conceived and gave birth to a son .
28:1:009:0	And the Lord said , “ Name him Lo-ammi , for you are not My people and I am not your God . ”
28:1:010:0	Yet the number of the sons of IsraelWill be like the sand of the sea , Which cannot be measured or numbered ; And in the placeWhere it is said to them , “ You are not My people , ” It will be said to them , “ You are the sons of the living God . ”
28:1:011:0	And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together , And they will appoint for themselves one leader , And they will go up from the land , For great will be the day of Jezreel .
