28:6:001:1	The Response to God’s Rebuke
28:6:001:0	“ Come , let us return to the Lord . For He has torn us , but He will heal us ; He has wounded us , but He will bandage us .
28:6:002:0	He will revive us after two days ; He will raise us up on the third day , That we may live before Him .
28:6:003:0	So let us know , let us press on to know the Lord . His going forth is as certain as the dawn ; And He will come to us like the rain , Like the spring rain watering the earth . ”
28:6:004:0	What shall I do with you , O Ephraim ? What shall I do with you , O Judah ? For your loyalty is like a morning cloudAnd like the dew which goes away early .
28:6:005:0	Therefore I have hewn them in pieces by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of My mouth ; And the judgments on you are like the light that goes forth .
28:6:006:0	For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice , And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings .
28:6:007:0	But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant ; There they have dealt treacherously against Me .
28:6:008:0	Gilead is a city of wrongdoers , Tracked with bloody footprints .
28:6:009:0	And as raiders wait for a man , So a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem ; Surely they have committed crime .
28:6:010:0	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing ; Ephraim’s harlotry is there , Israel has defiled itself .
28:6:011:0	Also , O Judah , there is a harvest appointed for you , When I restore the fortunes of My people .
