28:12:001:1	Ephraim Reminded
28:12:001:0	Ephraim feeds on wind , And pursues the east wind continually ; He multiplies lies and violence . Moreover , he makes a covenant with Assyria , And oil is carried to Egypt .
28:12:002:0	The Lord also has a dispute with Judah , And will punish Jacob according to his ways ; He will repay him according to his deeds .
28:12:003:0	In the womb he took his brother by the heel , And in his maturity he contended with God .
28:12:004:0	Yes , he wrestled with the angel and prevailed ; He wept and sought His favor . He found Him at BethelAnd there He spoke with us ,
28:12:005:0	Even the Lord , the God of hosts , The Lord is His name .
28:12:006:0	Therefore , return to your God , Observe kindness and justice , And wait for your God continually .
28:12:007:0	A merchant , in whose hands are false balances , He loves to oppress .
28:12:008:0	And Ephraim said , “ Surely I have become rich , I have found wealth for myself ; In all my labors they will find in meNo iniquity , which would be sin . ”
28:12:009:0	But I have been the Lord your God since the land of Egypt ; I will make you live in tents again , As in the days of the appointed festival .
28:12:010:0	I have also spoken to the prophets , And I gave numerous visions , And through the prophets I gave parables .
28:12:011:0	Is there iniquity in Gilead ? Surely they are worthless . In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls , Yes , their altars are like the stone heapsBeside the furrows of the field .
28:12:012:0	Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram , And Israel worked for a wife , And for a wife he kept sheep .
28:12:013:0	But by a prophet the Lord brought Israel from Egypt , And by a prophet he was kept .
28:12:014:0	Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger ; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on himAnd bring back his reproach to him .
