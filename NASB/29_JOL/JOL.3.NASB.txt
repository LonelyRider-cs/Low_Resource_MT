29:3:001:1	The Nations Will Be Judged
29:3:001:0	“ For behold , in those days and at that time , When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem ,
29:3:002:0	I will gather all the nationsAnd bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat . Then I will enter into judgment with them thereOn behalf of My people and My inheritance , Israel , Whom they have scattered among the nations ; And they have divided up My land .
29:3:003:0	They have also cast lots for My people , Traded a boy for a harlotAnd sold a girl for wine that they may drink .
29:3:004:0	Moreover , what are you to Me , O Tyre , Sidon and all the regions of Philistia ? Are you rendering Me a recompense ? But if you do recompense Me , swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head .
29:3:005:0	Since you have taken My silver and My gold , brought My precious treasures to your temples ,
29:3:006:0	and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory ,
29:3:007:0	behold , I am going to arouse them from the place where you have sold them , and return your recompense on your head .
29:3:008:0	Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah , and they will sell them to the Sabeans , to a distant nation , ” for the Lord has spoken .
29:3:009:0	Proclaim this among the nations : Prepare a war ; rouse the mighty men ! Let all the soldiers draw near , let them come up !
29:3:010:0	Beat your plowshares into swordsAnd your pruning hooks into spears ; Let the weak say , “ I am a mighty man . ”
29:3:011:0	Hasten and come , all you surrounding nations , And gather yourselves there . Bring down , O Lord , Your mighty ones .
29:3:012:0	Let the nations be arousedAnd come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat , For there I will sit to judgeAll the surrounding nations .
29:3:013:0	Put in the sickle , for the harvest is ripe . Come , tread , for the wine press is full ; The vats overflow , for their wickedness is great .
29:3:014:0	Multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision .
29:3:015:0	The sun and moon grow darkAnd the stars lose their brightness .
29:3:016:0	The Lord roars from ZionAnd utters His voice from Jerusalem , And the heavens and the earth tremble . But the Lord is a refuge for His peopleAnd a stronghold to the sons of Israel .
29:3:002:1	Judah Will Be Blessed
29:3:017:0	Then you will know that I am the Lord your God , Dwelling in Zion , My holy mountain . So Jerusalem will be holy , And strangers will pass through it no more .
29:3:018:0	And in that dayThe mountains will drip with sweet wine , And the hills will flow with milk , And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water ; And a spring will go out from the house of the LordTo water the valley of Shittim .
29:3:019:0	Egypt will become a waste , And Edom will become a desolate wilderness , Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah , In whose land they have shed innocent blood .
29:3:020:0	But Judah will be inhabited foreverAnd Jerusalem for all generations .
29:3:021:0	And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged , For the Lord dwells in Zion .
