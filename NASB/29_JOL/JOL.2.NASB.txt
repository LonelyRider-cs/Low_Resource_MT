29:2:001:1	The Terrible Visitation
29:2:001:0	Blow a trumpet in Zion , And sound an alarm on My holy mountain ! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble , For the day of the Lord is coming ; Surely it is near ,
29:2:002:0	A day of darkness and gloom , A day of clouds and thick darkness . As the dawn is spread over the mountains , So there is a great and mighty people ; There has never been anything like it , Nor will there be again after itTo the years of many generations .
29:2:003:0	A fire consumes before themAnd behind them a flame burns . The land is like the garden of Eden before themBut a desolate wilderness behind them , And nothing at all escapes them .
29:2:004:0	Their appearance is like the appearance of horses ; And like war horses , so they run .
29:2:005:0	With a noise as of chariotsThey leap on the tops of the mountains , Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble , Like a mighty people arranged for battle .
29:2:006:0	Before them the people are in anguish ; All faces turn pale .
29:2:007:0	They run like mighty men , They climb the wall like soldiers ; And they each march in line , Nor do they deviate from their paths .
29:2:008:0	They do not crowd each other , They march everyone in his path ; When they burst through the defenses , They do not break ranks .
29:2:009:0	They rush on the city , They run on the wall ; They climb into the houses , They enter through the windows like a thief .
29:2:010:0	Before them the earth quakes , The heavens tremble , The sun and the moon grow darkAnd the stars lose their brightness .
29:2:011:0	The Lord utters His voice before His army ; Surely His camp is very great , For strong is he who carries out His word . The day of the Lord is indeed great and very awesome , And who can endure it ?
29:2:012:0	“ Yet even now , ” declares the Lord , “ Return to Me with all your heart , And with fasting , weeping and mourning ;
29:2:013:0	And rend your heart and not your garments . ” Now return to the Lord your God , For He is gracious and compassionate , Slow to anger , abounding in lovingkindnessAnd relenting of evil .
29:2:014:0	Who knows whether He will not turn and relentAnd leave a blessing behind Him , Even a grain offering and a drink offeringFor the Lord your God ?
29:2:015:0	Blow a trumpet in Zion , Consecrate a fast , proclaim a solemn assembly ,
29:2:016:0	Gather the people , sanctify the congregation , Assemble the elders , Gather the children and the nursing infants . Let the bridegroom come out of his roomAnd the bride out of her bridal chamber .
29:2:002:1	Deliverance Promised
29:2:017:0	Let the priests , the Lord’s ministers , Weep between the porch and the altar , And let them say , “ Spare Your people , O Lord , And do not make Your inheritance a reproach , A byword among the nations . Why should they among the peoples say , ‘Where is their God ? ’ ”
29:2:018:0	Then the Lord will be zealous for His landAnd will have pity on His people .
29:2:019:0	The Lord will answer and say to His people , “ Behold , I am going to send you grain , new wine and oil , And you will be satisfied in full with them ; And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations .
29:2:020:0	But I will remove the northern army far from you , And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land , And its vanguard into the eastern sea , And its rear guard into the western sea . And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up , For it has done great things . ”
29:2:021:0	Do not fear , O land , rejoice and be glad , For the Lord has done great things .
29:2:022:0	Do not fear , beasts of the field , For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green , For the tree has borne its fruit , The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full .
29:2:023:0	So rejoice , O sons of Zion , And be glad in the Lord your God ; For He has given you the early rain for your vindication . And He has poured down for you the rain , The early and latter rain as before .
29:2:024:0	The threshing floors will be full of grain , And the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil .
29:2:025:0	“ Then I will make up to you for the yearsThat the swarming locust has eaten , The creeping locust , the stripping locust and the gnawing locust , My great army which I sent among you .
29:2:026:0	You will have plenty to eat and be satisfiedAnd praise the name of the Lord your God , Who has dealt wondrously with you ; Then My people will never be put to shame .
29:2:003:1	The Promise of the Spirit
29:2:027:0	Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , And that I am the Lord your God , And there is no other ; And My people will never be put to shame .
29:2:028:0	“ It will come about after thisThat I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind ; And your sons and daughters will prophesy , Your old men will dream dreams , Your young men will see visions .
29:2:004:1	The Day of the L
29:2:005:1	ord
29:2:029:0	Even on the male and female servantsI will pour out My Spirit in those days .
29:2:030:0	I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth , Blood , fire and columns of smoke .
29:2:031:0	The sun will be turned into darknessAnd the moon into bloodBefore the great and awesome day of the Lord comes .
29:2:032:0	And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LordWill be delivered ; For on Mount Zion and in JerusalemThere will be those who escape , As the Lord has said , Even among the survivors whom the Lord calls .
