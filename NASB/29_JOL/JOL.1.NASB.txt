29:1:001:1	The Devastation of Locusts
29:1:001:0	The word of the Lord that came to Joel , the son of Pethuel :
29:1:002:0	Hear this , O elders , And listen , all inhabitants of the land . Has anything like this happened in your daysOr in your fathersâ€™ days ?
29:1:003:0	Tell your sons about it , And let your sons tell their sons , And their sons the next generation .
29:1:004:0	What the gnawing locust has left , the swarming locust has eaten ; And what the swarming locust has left , the creeping locust has eaten ; And what the creeping locust has left , the stripping locust has eaten .
29:1:005:0	Awake , drunkards , and weep ; And wail , all you wine drinkers , On account of the sweet wineThat is cut off from your mouth .
29:1:006:0	For a nation has invaded my land , Mighty and without number ; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion , And it has the fangs of a lioness .
29:1:007:0	It has made my vine a wasteAnd my fig tree splinters . It has stripped them bare and cast them away ; Their branches have become white .
29:1:008:0	Wail like a virgin girded with sackclothFor the bridegroom of her youth .
29:1:009:0	The grain offering and the drink offering are cut offFrom the house of the Lord . The priests mourn , The ministers of the Lord .
29:1:010:0	The field is ruined , The land mourns ; For the grain is ruined , The new wine dries up , Fresh oil fails .
29:1:011:0	Be ashamed , O farmers , Wail , O vinedressers , For the wheat and the barley ; Because the harvest of the field is destroyed .
29:1:012:0	The vine dries upAnd the fig tree fails ; The pomegranate , the palm also , and the apple tree , All the trees of the field dry up . Indeed , rejoicing dries upFrom the sons of men .
29:1:002:1	Starvation and Drought
29:1:013:0	Gird yourselves with sackclothAnd lament , O priests ; Wail , O ministers of the altar ! Come , spend the night in sackclothO ministers of my God , For the grain offering and the drink offeringAre withheld from the house of your God .
29:1:014:0	Consecrate a fast , Proclaim a solemn assembly ; Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the landTo the house of the Lord your God , And cry out to the Lord .
29:1:015:0	Alas for the day ! For the day of the Lord is near , And it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
29:1:016:0	Has not food been cut off before our eyes , Gladness and joy from the house of our God ?
29:1:017:0	The seeds shrivel under their clods ; The storehouses are desolate , The barns are torn down , For the grain is dried up .
29:1:018:0	How the beasts groan ! The herds of cattle wander aimlesslyBecause there is no pasture for them ; Even the flocks of sheep suffer .
29:1:019:0	To You , O Lord , I cry ; For fire has devoured the pastures of the wildernessAnd the flame has burned up all the trees of the field .
29:1:020:0	Even the beasts of the field pant for You ; For the water brooks are dried upAnd fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
