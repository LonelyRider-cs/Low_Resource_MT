26:34:001:1	Prophecy against the Shepherds of Israel
26:34:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:34:002:0	“ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel . Prophesy and say to those shepherds , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Woe , shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves ! Should not the shepherds feed the flock ?
26:34:003:0	You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool , you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock .
26:34:004:0	Those who are sickly you have not strengthened , the diseased you have not healed , the broken you have not bound up , the scattered you have not brought back , nor have you sought for the lost ; but with force and with severity you have dominated them .
26:34:005:0	They were scattered for lack of a shepherd , and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered .
26:34:006:0	My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill ; My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth , and there was no one to search or seek for them . ” ’ ”
26:34:007:0	Therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
26:34:008:0	“ As I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ surely because My flock has become a prey , My flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field for lack of a shepherd , and My shepherds did not search for My flock , but rather the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock ;
26:34:009:0	therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
26:34:002:1	The Restoration of Israel
26:34:010:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I am against the shepherds , and I will demand My sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep . So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore , but I will deliver My flock from their mouth , so that they will not be food for them . ” ’ ”
26:34:011:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out .
26:34:012:0	As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep , so I will care for My sheep and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day .
26:34:013:0	I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the streams , and in all the inhabited places of the land .
26:34:014:0	I will feed them in a good pasture , and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel . There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel .
26:34:015:0	I will feed My flock and I will lead them to rest , ” declares the Lord God .
26:34:016:0	“ I will seek the lost , bring back the scattered , bind up the broken and strengthen the sick ; but the fat and the strong I will destroy . I will feed them with judgment .
26:34:017:0	“ As for you , My flock , thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold , I will judge between one sheep and another , between the rams and the male goats .
26:34:018:0	Is it too slight a thing for you that you should feed in the good pasture , that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures ? Or that you should drink of the clear waters , that you must foul the rest with your feet ?
26:34:019:0	As for My flock , they must eat what you tread down with your feet and drink what you foul with your feet ! ’ ”
26:34:020:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God to them , “ Behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
26:34:021:0	Because you push with side and with shoulder , and thrust at all the weak with your horns until you have scattered them abroad ,
26:34:022:0	therefore , I will deliver My flock , and they will no longer be a prey ; and I will judge between one sheep and another .
26:34:023:0	“ Then I will set over them one shepherd , My servant David , and he will feed them ; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd .
26:34:024:0	And I , the Lord , will be their God , and My servant David will be prince among them ; I the Lord have spoken .
26:34:025:0	“ I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful beasts from the land so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods .
26:34:026:0	I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing . And I will cause showers to come down in their season ; they will be showers of blessing .
26:34:027:0	Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit and the earth will yield its increase , and they will be secure on their land . Then they will know that I am the Lord , when I have broken the bars of their yoke and have delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them .
26:34:028:0	They will no longer be a prey to the nations , and the beasts of the earth will not devour them ; but they will live securely , and no one will make them afraid .
26:34:029:0	I will establish for them a renowned planting place , and they will not again be victims of famine in the land , and they will not endure the insults of the nations anymore .
26:34:030:0	Then they will know that I , the Lord their God , am with them , and that they , the house of Israel , are My people , ” declares the Lord God .
26:34:031:0	“ As for you , My sheep , the sheep of My pasture , you are men , and I am your God , ” declares the Lord God .
