26:13:001:1	False Prophets Condemned
26:13:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:13:002:0	“ Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy , and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration , ‘Listen to the word of the Lord !
26:13:003:0	Thus says the Lord God , “ Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing .
26:13:004:0	O Israel , your prophets have been like foxes among ruins .
26:13:005:0	You have not gone up into the breaches , nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord .
26:13:006:0	They see falsehood and lying divination who are saying , ‘The Lord declares , ’ when the Lord has not sent them ; yet they hope for the fulfillment of their word .
26:13:007:0	Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said , ‘The Lord declares , ’ but it is not I who have spoken ? ” ’ ”
26:13:008:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie , therefore behold , I am against you , ” declares the Lord God .
26:13:009:0	“ So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations . They will have no place in the council of My people , nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel , nor will they enter the land of Israel , that you may know that I am the Lord God .
26:13:010:0	It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying , ‘Peace ! ’ when there is no peace . And when anyone builds a wall , behold , they plaster it over with whitewash ;
26:13:011:0	so tell those who plaster it over with whitewash , that it will fall . A flooding rain will come , and you , O hailstones , will fall ; and a violent wind will break out .
26:13:012:0	Behold , when the wall has fallen , will you not be asked , ‘Where is the plaster with which you plastered it ? ’ ”
26:13:013:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath . There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones to consume it in wrath .
26:13:014:0	So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation is laid bare ; and when it falls , you will be consumed in its midst . And you will know that I am the Lord .
26:13:015:0	Thus I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with whitewash ; and I will say to you , ‘The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone ,
26:13:016:0	along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem , and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace , ’ declares the Lord God .
26:13:017:0	“ Now you , son of man , set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own inspiration . Prophesy against them
26:13:018:0	and say , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature to hunt down lives ! Will you hunt down the lives of My people , but preserve the lives of others for yourselves ?
26:13:019:0	For handfuls of barley and fragments of bread , you have profaned Me to My people to put to death some who should not die and to keep others alive who should not live , by your lying to My people who listen to lies . ” ’ ”
26:13:020:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I am against your magic bands by which you hunt lives there as birds and I will tear them from your arms ; and I will let them go , even those lives whom you hunt as birds .
26:13:021:0	I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands , and they will no longer be in your hands to be hunted ; and you will know that I am the Lord .
26:13:022:0	Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief , but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way and preserve his life ,
26:13:023:0	therefore , you women will no longer see false visions or practice divination , and I will deliver My people out of your hand . Thus you will know that I am the Lord . ”
