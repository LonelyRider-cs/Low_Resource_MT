26:5:001:1	Jerusalem’s Desolation Foretold
26:5:001:0	“ As for you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; take and use it as a barber’s razor on your head and beard . Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair .
26:5:002:0	One third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city , when the days of the siege are completed . Then you shall take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city , and one third you shall scatter to the wind ; and I will unsheathe a sword behind them .
26:5:003:0	Take also a few in number from them and bind them in the edges of your robes .
26:5:004:0	Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire ; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel .
26:5:005:0	“ Thus says the Lord God , ‘This is Jerusalem ; I have set her at the center of the nations , with lands around her .
26:5:006:0	But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her ; for they have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes . ’
26:5:007:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , ‘Because you have more turmoil than the nations which surround you and have not walked in My statutes , nor observed My ordinances , nor observed the ordinances of the nations which surround you , ’
26:5:008:0	therefore , thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold , I , even I , am against you , and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations .
26:5:009:0	And because of all your abominations , I will do among you what I have not done , and the like of which I will never do again .
26:5:010:0	Therefore , fathers will eat their sons among you , and sons will eat their fathers ; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to every wind .
26:5:011:0	So as I live , ’ declares the Lord God , ‘surely , because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations , therefore I will also withdraw , and My eye will have no pity and I will not spare .
26:5:012:0	One third of you will die by plague or be consumed by famine among you , one third will fall by the sword around you , and one third I will scatter to every wind , and I will unsheathe a sword behind them .
26:5:013:0	‘Thus My anger will be spent and I will satisfy My wrath on them , and I will be appeased ; then they will know that I , the Lord , have spoken in My zeal when I have spent My wrath upon them .
26:5:014:0	Moreover , I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations which surround you , in the sight of all who pass by .
26:5:015:0	So it will be a reproach , a reviling , a warning and an object of horror to the nations who surround you when I execute judgments against you in anger , wrath and raging rebukes . I , the Lord , have spoken .
26:5:016:0	When I send against them the deadly arrows of famine which were for the destruction of those whom I will send to destroy you , then I will also intensify the famine upon you and break the staff of bread .
26:5:017:0	Moreover , I will send on you famine and wild beasts , and they will bereave you of children ; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you , and I will bring the sword on you . I , the Lord , have spoken . ’ ”
