26:15:001:1	Jerusalem like a Useless Vine
26:15:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:15:002:0	“ Son of man , how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
26:15:003:0	Can wood be taken from it to make anything , or can men take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel ?
26:15:004:0	If it has been put into the fire for fuel , and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred , is it then useful for anything ?
26:15:005:0	Behold , while it is intact , it is not made into anything . How much less , when the fire has consumed it and it is charred , can it still be made into anything !
26:15:006:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , ‘As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
26:15:007:0	and I set My face against them . Though they have come out of the fire , yet the fire will consume them . Then you will know that I am the Lord , when I set My face against them .
26:15:008:0	Thus I will make the land desolate , because they have acted unfaithfully , ’ ” declares the Lord God .
