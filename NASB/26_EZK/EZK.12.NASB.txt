26:12:001:1	Ezekiel Prepares for Exile
26:12:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:12:002:0	“ Son of man , you live in the midst of the rebellious house , who have eyes to see but do not see , ears to hear but do not hear ; for they are a rebellious house .
26:12:003:0	Therefore , son of man , prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight ; even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight . Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house .
26:12:004:0	Bring your baggage out by day in their sight , as baggage for exile . Then you will go out at evening in their sight , as those going into exile .
26:12:005:0	Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it .
26:12:006:0	Load the baggage on your shoulder in their sight and carry it out in the dark . You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land , for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel . ”
26:12:007:0	I did so , as I had been commanded . By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile . Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands ; I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder in their sight .
26:12:008:0	In the morning the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:12:009:0	“ Son of man , has not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , said to you , ‘What are you doing ? ’
26:12:010:0	Say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are in it . ” ’
26:12:011:0	Say , ‘I am a sign to you . As I have done , so it will be done to them ; they will go into exile , into captivity . ’
26:12:012:0	The prince who is among them will load his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out . They will dig a hole through the wall to bring it out . He will cover his face so that he can not see the land with his eyes .
26:12:013:0	I will also spread My net over him , and he will be caught in My snare . And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans ; yet he will not see it , though he will die there .
26:12:014:0	I will scatter to every wind all who are around him , his helpers and all his troops ; and I will draw out a sword after them .
26:12:015:0	So they will know that I am the Lord when I scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries .
26:12:016:0	But I will spare a few of them from the sword , the famine and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go , and may know that I am the Lord . ”
26:12:017:0	Moreover , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:12:018:0	“ Son of man , eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety .
26:12:019:0	Then say to the people of the land , ‘Thus says the Lord God concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel , “ They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror , because their land will be stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it .
26:12:020:0	The inhabited cities will be laid waste and the land will be a desolation . So you will know that I am the Lord . ” ’ ”
26:12:021:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:12:022:0	“ Son of man , what is this proverb you people have concerning the land of Israel , saying , ‘The days are long and every vision fails’ ?
26:12:023:0	Therefore say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ I will make this proverb cease so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel . ” But tell them , “ The days draw near as well as the fulfillment of every vision .
26:12:024:0	For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel .
26:12:025:0	For I the Lord will speak , and whatever word I speak will be performed . It will no longer be delayed , for in your days , O rebellious house , I will speak the word and perform it , ” declares the Lord God . ’ ”
26:12:026:0	Furthermore , the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:12:027:0	“ Son of man , behold , the house of Israel is saying , ‘The vision that he sees is for many years from now , and he prophesies of times far off . ’
26:12:028:0	Therefore say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ None of My words will be delayed any longer . Whatever word I speak will be performed , ” ’ ” declares the Lord God .
