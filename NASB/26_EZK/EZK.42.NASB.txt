26:42:001:1	Chambers of the Temple
26:42:001:0	Then he brought me out into the outer court , the way toward the north ; and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north .
26:42:002:0	Along the length , which was a hundred cubits , was the north door ; the width was fifty cubits .
26:42:003:0	Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court , and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court , was gallery corresponding to gallery in three stories .
26:42:004:0	Before the chambers was an inner walk ten cubits wide , a way of one hundred cubits ; and their openings were on the north .
26:42:005:0	Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building .
26:42:006:0	For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts ; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground upward , more than the lower and middle ones .
26:42:007:0	As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers , toward the outer court facing the chambers , its length was fifty cubits .
26:42:008:0	For the length of the chambers which were in the outer court was fifty cubits ; and behold , the length of those facing the temple was a hundred cubits .
26:42:009:0	Below these chambers was the entrance on the east side , as one enters them from the outer court .
26:42:010:0	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , facing the separate area and facing the building , there were chambers .
26:42:011:0	The way in front of them was like the appearance of the chambers which were on the north , according to their length so was their width , and all their exits were both according to their arrangements and openings .
26:42:012:0	Corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way , the way in front of the wall toward the east , as one enters them .
26:42:013:0	Then he said to me , “ The north chambers and the south chambers , which are opposite the separate area , they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the Lord shall eat the most holy things . There they shall lay the most holy things , the grain offering , the sin offering and the guilt offering ; for the place is holy .
26:42:014:0	When the priests enter , then they shall not go out into the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there their garments in which they minister , for they are holy . They shall put on other garments ; then they shall approach that which is for the people . ”
26:42:015:0	Now when he had finished measuring the inner house , he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced toward the east and measured it all around .
26:42:016:0	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds by the measuring reed .
26:42:017:0	He measured on the north side five hundred reeds by the measuring reed .
26:42:018:0	On the south side he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
26:42:019:0	He turned to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
26:42:020:0	He measured it on the four sides ; it had a wall all around , the length five hundred and the width five hundred , to divide between the holy and the profane .
