26:47:001:1	Water from the Temple
26:47:001:0	Then he brought me back to the door of the house ; and behold , water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east , for the house faced east . And the water was flowing down from under , from the right side of the house , from south of the altar .
26:47:002:0	He brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of the gate that faces east . And behold , water was trickling from the south side .
26:47:003:0	When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand , he measured a thousand cubits , and he led me through the water , water reaching the ankles .
26:47:004:0	Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water , water reaching the knees . Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water , water reaching the loins .
26:47:005:0	Again he measured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not ford , for the water had risen , enough water to swim in , a river that could not be forded .
26:47:006:0	He said to me , “ Son of man , have you seen this ? ” Then he brought me back to the bank of the river .
26:47:007:0	Now when I had returned , behold , on the bank of the river there were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
26:47:008:0	Then he said to me , “ These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah ; then they go toward the sea , being made to flow into the sea , and the waters of the sea become fresh .
26:47:009:0	It will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes , will live . And there will be very many fish , for these waters go there and the others become fresh ; so everything will live where the river goes .
26:47:010:0	And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it ; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be a place for the spreading of nets . Their fish will be according to their kinds , like the fish of the Great Sea , very many .
26:47:011:0	But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh ; they will be left for salt .
26:47:002:1	Boundaries and Division of the Land
26:47:012:0	By the river on its bank , on one side and on the other , will grow all kinds of trees for food . Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail . They will bear every month because their water flows from the sanctuary , and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing . ”
26:47:013:0	Thus says the Lord God , “ This shall be the boundary by which you shall divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel ; Joseph shall have two portions .
26:47:014:0	You shall divide it for an inheritance , each one equally with the other ; for I swore to give it to your forefathers , and this land shall fall to you as an inheritance .
26:47:015:0	“ This shall be the boundary of the land : on the north side , from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon , to the entrance of Zedad ;
26:47:016:0	Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer-hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
26:47:017:0	The boundary shall extend from the sea to Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus , and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath . This is the north side .
26:47:018:0	“ The east side , from between Hauran , Damascus , Gilead and the land of Israel , shall be the Jordan ; from the north border to the eastern sea you shall measure . This is the east side .
26:47:019:0	“ The south side toward the south shall extend from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh , to the brook of Egypt and to the Great Sea . This is the south side toward the south .
26:47:020:0	“ The west side shall be the Great Sea , from the south border to a point opposite Lebo-hamath . This is the west side .
26:47:021:0	“ So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel .
26:47:022:0	You shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the aliens who stay in your midst , who bring forth sons in your midst . And they shall be to you as the native-born among the sons of Israel ; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel .
26:47:023:0	And in the tribe with which the alien stays , there you shall give him his inheritance , ” declares the Lord God .
