26:25:001:1	Judgment on Gentile Nations—Ammon
26:25:001:0	And the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:25:002:0	“ Son of man , set your face toward the sons of Ammon and prophesy against them ,
26:25:003:0	and say to the sons of Ammon , ‘Hear the word of the Lord God ! Thus says the Lord God , “ Because you said , ‘Aha ! ’ against My sanctuary when it was profaned , and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate , and against the house of Judah when they went into exile ,
26:25:004:0	therefore , behold , I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession , and they will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you ; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk .
26:25:005:0	I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for flocks . Thus you will know that I am the Lord . ”
26:25:006:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the scorn of your soul against the land of Israel ,
26:25:002:1	Moab
26:25:007:0	therefore , behold , I have stretched out My hand against you and I will give you for spoil to the nations . And I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands ; I will destroy you . Thus you will know that I am the Lord . ”
26:25:008:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Because Moab and Seir say , ‘Behold , the house of Judah is like all the nations , ’
26:25:009:0	therefore , behold , I am going to deprive the flank of Moab of its cities , of its cities which are on its frontiers , the glory of the land , Beth-jeshimoth , Baal-meon and Kiriathaim ,
26:25:010:0	and I will give it for a possession along with the sons of Ammon to the sons of the east , so that the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations .
26:25:003:1	Edom
26:25:011:0	Thus I will execute judgments on Moab , and they will know that I am the Lord . ”
26:25:012:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and has incurred grievous guilt , and avenged themselves upon them , ”
26:25:013:0	therefore thus says the Lord God , “ I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off man and beast from it . And I will lay it waste ; from Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword .
26:25:004:1	Philistia
26:25:014:0	I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel . Therefore , they will act in Edom according to My anger and according to My wrath ; thus they will know My vengeance , ” declares the Lord God .
26:25:015:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Because the Philistines have acted in revenge and have taken vengeance with scorn of soul to destroy with everlasting enmity , ”
26:25:016:0	therefore thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines , even cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast .
26:25:017:0	I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes ; and they will know that I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance on them . ” ’ ”
