26:7:001:1	Punishment for Wickedness Foretold
26:7:001:0	Moreover , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:7:002:0	“ And you , son of man , thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel , ‘An end ! The end is coming on the four corners of the land .
26:7:003:0	Now the end is upon you , and I will send My anger against you ; I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you .
26:7:004:0	For My eye will have no pity on you , nor will I spare you , but I will bring your ways upon you , and your abominations will be among you ; then you will know that I am the Lord ! ’
26:7:005:0	“ Thus says the Lord God , ‘A disaster , unique disaster , behold it is coming !
26:7:006:0	An end is coming ; the end has come ! It has awakened against you ; behold , it has come !
26:7:007:0	Your doom has come to you , O inhabitant of the land . The time has come , the day is near—tumult rather than joyful shouting on the mountains .
26:7:008:0	Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and spend My anger against you ; judge you according to your ways and bring on you all your abominations .
26:7:009:0	My eye will show no pity nor will I spare . I will repay you according to your ways , while your abominations are in your midst ; then you will know that I , the Lord , do the smiting .
26:7:010:0	‘Behold , the day ! Behold , it is coming ! Your doom has gone forth ; the rod has budded , arrogance has blossomed .
26:7:011:0	Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness . None of them shall remain , none of their people , none of their wealth , nor anything eminent among them .
26:7:012:0	The time has come , the day has arrived . Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is against all their multitude .
26:7:013:0	Indeed , the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live ; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted , nor will any of them maintain his life by his iniquity .
26:7:014:0	‘They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready , but no one is going to the battle , for My wrath is against all their multitude .
26:7:015:0	The sword is outside and the plague and the famine are within . He who is in the field will die by the sword ; famine and the plague will also consume those in the city .
26:7:016:0	Even when their survivors escape , they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , each over his own iniquity .
26:7:017:0	All hands will hang limp and all knees will become like water .
26:7:018:0	They will gird themselves with sackcloth and shuddering will overwhelm them ; and shame will be on all faces and baldness on all their heads .
26:7:002:1	The Temple Profaned
26:7:019:0	They will fling their silver into the streets and their gold will become an abhorrent thing ; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord . They cannot satisfy their appetite nor can they fill their stomachs , for their iniquity has become an occasion of stumbling .
26:7:020:0	They transformed the beauty of His ornaments into pride , and they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things with it ; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them .
26:7:021:0	I will give it into the hands of the foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil , and they will profane it .
26:7:022:0	I will also turn My face from them , and they will profane My secret place ; then robbers will enter and profane it .
26:7:023:0	‘Make the chain , for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence .
26:7:024:0	Therefore , I will bring the worst of the nations , and they will possess their houses . I will also make the pride of the strong ones cease , and their holy places will be profaned .
26:7:025:0	When anguish comes , they will seek peace , but there will be none .
26:7:026:0	Disaster will come upon disaster and rumor will be added to rumor ; then they will seek a vision from a prophet , but the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders .
26:7:027:0	The king will mourn , the prince will be clothed with horror , and the hands of the people of the land will tremble . According to their conduct I will deal with them , and by their judgments I will judge them . And they will know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
