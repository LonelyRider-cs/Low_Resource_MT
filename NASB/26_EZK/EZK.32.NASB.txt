26:32:001:1	Lament over Pharaoh and Egypt
26:32:001:0	In the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , on the first of the month , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:32:002:0	“ Son of man , take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him , ‘You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations , Yet you are like the monster in the seas ; And you burst forth in your riversAnd muddied the waters with your feetAnd fouled their rivers . ’ ”
26:32:003:0	Thus says the Lord God , “ Now I will spread My net over youWith a company of many peoples , And they shall lift you up in My net .
26:32:004:0	I will leave you on the land ; I will cast you on the open field . And I will cause all the birds of the heavens to dwell on you , And I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you .
26:32:005:0	I will lay your flesh on the mountainsAnd fill the valleys with your refuse .
26:32:006:0	I will also make the land drink the discharge of your bloodAs far as the mountains , And the ravines will be full of you .
26:32:007:0	And when I extinguish you , I will cover the heavens and darken their stars ; I will cover the sun with a cloudAnd the moon will not give its light .
26:32:008:0	All the shining lights in the heavensI will darken over youAnd will set darkness on your land , ” Declares the Lord God .
26:32:009:0	“ I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction among the nations , into lands which you have not known .
26:32:010:0	I will make many peoples appalled at you , and their kings will be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them ; and they will tremble every moment , every man for his own life , on the day of your fall . ”
26:32:011:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you .
26:32:012:0	By the swords of the mighty ones I will cause your hordes to fall ; all of them are tyrants of the nations , And they will devastate the pride of Egypt , And all its hordes will be destroyed .
26:32:013:0	I will also destroy all its cattle from beside many waters ; And the foot of man will not muddy them anymoreAnd the hoofs of beasts will not muddy them .
26:32:014:0	Then I will make their waters settleAnd will cause their rivers to run like oil , ” Declares the Lord God .
26:32:015:0	“ When I make the land of Egypt a desolation , And the land is destitute of that which filled it , When I smite all those who live in it , Then they shall know that I am the Lord .
26:32:016:0	This is a lamentation and they shall chant it . The daughters of the nations shall chant it . Over Egypt and over all her hordes they shall chant it , ” declares the Lord God .
26:32:017:0	In the twelfth year , on the fifteenth of the month , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:32:018:0	“ Son of man , wail for the hordes of Egypt and bring it down , her and the daughters of the powerful nations , to the nether world , with those who go down to the pit ;
26:32:019:0	‘Whom do you surpass in beauty ? Go down and make your bed with the uncircumcised . ’
26:32:020:0	They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword . She is given over to the sword ; they have drawn her and all her hordes away .
26:32:021:0	The strong among the mighty ones shall speak of him and his helpers from the midst of Sheol , ‘They have gone down , they lie still , the uncircumcised , slain by the sword . ’
26:32:022:0	“ Assyria is there and all her company ; her graves are round about her . All of them are slain , fallen by the sword ,
26:32:023:0	whose graves are set in the remotest parts of the pit and her company is round about her grave . All of them are slain , fallen by the sword , who spread terror in the land of the living .
26:32:024:0	“ Elam is there and all her hordes around her grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth , who instilled their terror in the land of the living and bore their disgrace with those who went down to the pit .
26:32:025:0	They have made a bed for her among the slain with all her hordes . Her graves are around it , they are all uncircumcised , slain by the sword ( although their terror was instilled in the land of the living ) , and they bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit ; they were put in the midst of the slain .
26:32:026:0	“ Meshech , Tubal and all their hordes are there ; their graves surround them . All of them were slain by the sword uncircumcised , though they instilled their terror in the land of the living .
26:32:027:0	Nor do they lie beside the fallen heroes of the uncircumcised , who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war and whose swords were laid under their heads ; but the punishment for their iniquity rested on their bones , though the terror of these heroes was once in the land of the living .
26:32:028:0	But in the midst of the uncircumcised you will be broken and lie with those slain by the sword .
26:32:029:0	“ There also is Edom , its kings and all its princes , who for all their might are laid with those slain by the sword ; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the pit .
26:32:030:0	“ There also are the chiefs of the north , all of them , and all the Sidonians , who in spite of the terror resulting from their might , in shame went down with the slain . So they lay down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit .
26:32:031:0	“ These Pharaoh will see , and he will be comforted for all his hordes slain by the sword , even Pharaoh and all his army , ” declares the Lord God .
26:32:032:0	“ Though I instilled a terror of him in the land of the living , yet he will be made to lie down among the uncircumcised along with those slain by the sword , even Pharaoh and all his hordes , ” declares the Lord God .
