26:40:001:1	Vision of the Man with a Measuring Rod
26:40:001:0	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile , at the beginning of the year , on the tenth of the month , in the fourteenth year after the city was taken , on that same day the hand of the Lord was upon me and He brought me there .
26:40:002:0	In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain , and on it to the south there was a structure like a city .
26:40:003:0	So He brought me there ; and behold , there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze , with a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand ; and he was standing in the gateway .
26:40:002:1	Measurements Relating to the Temple
26:40:004:0	The man said to me , “ Son of man , see with your eyes , hear with your ears , and give attention to all that I am going to show you ; for you have been brought here in order to show it to you . Declare to the house of Israel all that you see . ”
26:40:005:0	And behold , there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around , and in the man’s hand was a measuring rod of six cubits , each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth . So he measured the thickness of the wall , one rod ; and the height , one rod .
26:40:006:0	Then he went to the gate which faced east , went up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate , one rod in width ; and the other threshold was one rod in width .
26:40:007:0	The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide ; and there were five cubits between the guardrooms . And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was one rod .
26:40:008:0	Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward , one rod .
26:40:009:0	He measured the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and its side pillars , two cubits . And the porch of the gate was faced inward .
26:40:010:0	The guardrooms of the gate toward the east numbered three on each side ; the three of them had the same measurement . The side pillars also had the same measurement on each side .
26:40:011:0	And he measured the width of the gateway , ten cubits , and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits .
26:40:012:0	There was a barrier wall one cubit wide in front of the guardrooms on each side ; and the guardrooms were six cubits square on each side .
26:40:013:0	He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other , a width of twenty-five cubits from one door to the door opposite .
26:40:014:0	He made the side pillars sixty cubits high ; the gate extended round about to the side pillar of the courtyard .
26:40:015:0	From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was fifty cubits .
26:40:016:0	There were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms , and toward their side pillars within the gate all around , and likewise for the porches . And there were windows all around inside ; and on each side pillar were palm tree ornaments .
26:40:017:0	Then he brought me into the outer court , and behold , there were chambers and a pavement made for the court all around ; thirty chambers faced the pavement .
26:40:018:0	The pavement ( that is , the lower pavement ) was by the side of the gates , corresponding to the length of the gates .
26:40:019:0	Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court , a hundred cubits on the east and on the north .
26:40:020:0	As for the gate of the outer court which faced the north , he measured its length and its width .
26:40:021:0	It had three guardrooms on each side ; and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate . Its length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits .
26:40:022:0	Its windows and its porches and its palm tree ornaments had the same measurements as the gate which faced toward the east ; and it was reached by seven steps , and its porch was in front of them .
26:40:023:0	The inner court had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east ; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate .
26:40:024:0	Then he led me toward the south , and behold , there was a gate toward the south ; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same measurements .
26:40:025:0	The gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows ; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits .
26:40:026:0	There were seven steps going up to it , and its porches were in front of them ; and it had palm tree ornaments on its side pillars , one on each side .
26:40:027:0	The inner court had a gate toward the south ; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south , a hundred cubits .
26:40:028:0	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate ; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements .
26:40:029:0	Its guardrooms also , its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements . And the gate and its porches had windows all around ; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide .
26:40:030:0	There were porches all around , twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide .
26:40:031:0	Its porches were toward the outer court ; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars , and its stairway had eight steps .
26:40:032:0	He brought me into the inner court toward the east . And he measured the gate according to those same measurements .
26:40:033:0	Its guardrooms also , its side pillars and its porches were according to those same measurements . And the gate and its porches had windows all around ; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide .
26:40:034:0	Its porches were toward the outer court ; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars , on each side , and its stairway had eight steps .
26:40:035:0	Then he brought me to the north gate ; and he measured it according to those same measurements ,
26:40:036:0	with its guardrooms , its side pillars and its porches . And the gate had windows all around ; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits .
26:40:037:0	Its side pillars were toward the outer court ; and palm tree ornaments were on its side pillars on each side , and its stairway had eight steps .
26:40:038:0	A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates ; there they rinse the burnt offering .
26:40:039:0	In the porch of the gate were two tables on each side , on which to slaughter the burnt offering , the sin offering and the guilt offering .
26:40:040:0	On the outer side , as one went up to the gateway toward the north , were two tables ; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables .
26:40:041:0	Four tables were on each side next to the gate ; or , eight tables on which they slaughter sacrifices .
26:40:042:0	For the burnt offering there were four tables of hewn stone , a cubit and a half long , a cubit and a half wide and one cubit high , on which they lay the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice .
26:40:043:0	The double hooks , one handbreadth in length , were installed in the house all around ; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering .
26:40:044:0	From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court , one of which was at the side of the north gate , with its front toward the south , and one at the side of the south gate facing toward the north .
26:40:045:0	He said to me , “ This is the chamber which faces toward the south , intended for the priests who keep charge of the temple ;
26:40:046:0	but the chamber which faces toward the north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar . These are the sons of Zadok , who from the sons of Levi come near to the Lord to minister to Him . ”
26:40:047:0	He measured the court , a perfect square , a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide ; and the altar was in front of the temple .
26:40:048:0	Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured each side pillar of the porch , five cubits on each side ; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side .
26:40:049:0	The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits ; and at the stairway by which it was ascended were columns belonging to the side pillars , one on each side .
