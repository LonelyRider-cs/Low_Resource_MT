26:1:001:1	The Vision of Four Figures
26:1:001:0	Now it came about in the thirtieth year , on the fifth day of the fourth month , while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles , the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God .
26:1:002:0	( On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile ,
26:1:003:0	the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest , son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and there the hand of the Lord came upon him . )
26:1:004:0	As I looked , behold , a storm wind was coming from the north , a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it , and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire .
26:1:005:0	Within it there were figures resembling four living beings . And this was their appearance : they had human form .
26:1:006:0	Each of them had four faces and four wings .
26:1:007:0	Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf’s hoof , and they gleamed like burnished bronze .
26:1:008:0	Under their wings on their four sides were human hands . As for the faces and wings of the four of them ,
26:1:009:0	their wings touched one another ; their faces did not turn when they moved , each went straight forward .
26:1:010:0	As for the form of their faces , each had the face of a man ; all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left , and all four had the face of an eagle .
26:1:011:0	Such were their faces . Their wings were spread out above ; each had two touching another being , and two covering their bodies .
26:1:012:0	And each went straight forward ; wherever the spirit was about to go , they would go , without turning as they went .
26:1:013:0	In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire , like torches darting back and forth among the living beings . The fire was bright , and lightning was flashing from the fire .
26:1:014:0	And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning .
26:1:015:0	Now as I looked at the living beings , behold , there was one wheel on the earth beside the living beings , for each of the four of them .
26:1:016:0	The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like sparkling beryl , and all four of them had the same form , their appearance and workmanship being as if one wheel were within another .
26:1:017:0	Whenever they moved , they moved in any of their four directions without turning as they moved .
26:1:018:0	As for their rims they were lofty and awesome , and the rims of all four of them were full of eyes round about .
26:1:019:0	Whenever the living beings moved , the wheels moved with them . And whenever the living beings rose from the earth , the wheels rose also .
26:1:020:0	Wherever the spirit was about to go , they would go in that direction . And the wheels rose close beside them ; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels .
26:1:002:1	Vision of Divine Glory
26:1:021:0	Whenever those went , these went ; and whenever those stood still , these stood still . And whenever those rose from the earth , the wheels rose close beside them ; for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels .
26:1:022:0	Now over the heads of the living beings there was something like an expanse , like the awesome gleam of crystal , spread out over their heads .
26:1:023:0	Under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight , one toward the other ; each one also had two wings covering its body on the one side and on the other .
26:1:024:0	I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of abundant waters as they went , like the voice of the Almighty , a sound of tumult like the sound of an army camp ; whenever they stood still , they dropped their wings .
26:1:025:0	And there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads ; whenever they stood still , they dropped their wings .
26:1:026:0	Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne , like lapis lazuli in appearance ; and on that which resembled a throne , high up , was a figure with the appearance of a man .
26:1:027:0	Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it , and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire ; and there was a radiance around Him .
26:1:028:0	As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day , so was the appearance of the surrounding radiance . Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord . And when I saw it , I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking .
