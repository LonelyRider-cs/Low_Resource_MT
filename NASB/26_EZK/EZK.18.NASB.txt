26:18:001:1	God Deals Justly with Individuals
26:18:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:18:002:0	“ What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , ‘The fathers eat the sour grapes , But the children’s teeth are set on edge’ ?
26:18:003:0	As I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ you are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore .
26:18:004:0	Behold , all souls are Mine ; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine . The soul who sins will die .
26:18:005:0	“ But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness ,
26:18:006:0	and does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , or defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period—
26:18:007:0	if a man does not oppress anyone , but restores to the debtor his pledge , does not commit robbery , but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing ,
26:18:008:0	if he does not lend money on interest or take increase , if he keeps his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between man and man ,
26:18:009:0	if he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully—he is righteous and will surely live , ” declares the Lord God .
26:18:010:0	“ Then he may have a violent son who sheds blood and who does any of these things to a brother
26:18:011:0	( though he himself did not do any of these things ) , that is , he even eats at the mountain shrines , and defiles his neighbor’s wife ,
26:18:012:0	oppresses the poor and needy , commits robbery , does not restore a pledge , but lifts up his eyes to the idols and commits abomination ,
26:18:013:0	he lends money on interest and takes increase ; will he live ? He will not live ! He has committed all these abominations , he will surely be put to death ; his blood will be on his own head .
26:18:014:0	“ Now behold , he has a son who has observed all his father’s sins which he committed , and observing does not do likewise .
26:18:015:0	He does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , or defile his neighbor’s wife ,
26:18:016:0	or oppress anyone , or retain a pledge , or commit robbery , but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing ,
26:18:017:0	he keeps his hand from the poor , does not take interest or increase , but executes My ordinances , and walks in My statutes ; he will not die for his father’s iniquity , he will surely live .
26:18:018:0	As for his father , because he practiced extortion , robbed his brother and did what was not good among his people , behold , he will die for his iniquity .
26:18:019:0	“ Yet you say , ‘Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity ? ’ When the son has practiced justice and righteousness and has observed all My statutes and done them , he shall surely live .
26:18:020:0	The person who sins will die . The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity , nor will the father bear the punishment for the son’s iniquity ; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself , and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself .
26:18:021:0	“ But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness , he shall surely live ; he shall not die .
26:18:022:0	All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him ; because of his righteousness which he has practiced , he will live .
26:18:023:0	Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked , ” declares the Lord God , “ rather than that he should turn from his ways and live ?
26:18:024:0	“ But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness , commits iniquity and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does , will he live ? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed ; for them he will die .
26:18:025:0	Yet you say , ‘The way of the Lord is not right . ’ Hear now , O house of Israel ! Is My way not right ? Is it not your ways that are not right ?
26:18:026:0	When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness , commits iniquity and dies because of it , for his iniquity which he has committed he will die .
26:18:027:0	Again , when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness , he will save his life .
26:18:028:0	Because he considered and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed , he shall surely live ; he shall not die .
26:18:029:0	But the house of Israel says , ‘The way of the Lord is not right . ’ Are My ways not right , O house of Israel ? Is it not your ways that are not right ?
26:18:030:0	“ Therefore I will judge you , O house of Israel , each according to his conduct , ” declares the Lord God . “ Repent and turn away from all your transgressions , so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you .
26:18:031:0	Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit ! For why will you die , O house of Israel ?
26:18:032:0	For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies , ” declares the Lord God . “ Therefore , repent and live . ”
