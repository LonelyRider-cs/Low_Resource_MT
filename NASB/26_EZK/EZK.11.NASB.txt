26:11:001:1	Evil Rulers to Be Judged
26:11:001:0	Moreover , the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the Lord’s house which faced eastward . And behold , there were twenty-five men at the entrance of the gate , and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah , leaders of the people .
26:11:002:0	He said to me , “ Son of man , these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil advice in this city ,
26:11:003:0	who say , ‘The time is not near to build houses . This city is the pot and we are the flesh . ’
26:11:004:0	Therefore , prophesy against them , son of man , prophesy ! ”
26:11:005:0	Then the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and He said to me , “ Say , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ So you think , house of Israel , for I know your thoughts .
26:11:006:0	You have multiplied your slain in this city , filling its streets with them . ”
26:11:007:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of the city are the flesh and this city is the pot ; but I will bring you out of it .
26:11:008:0	You have feared a sword ; so I will bring a sword upon you , ” the Lord God declares .
26:11:009:0	“ And I will bring you out of the midst of the city and deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you .
26:11:010:0	You will fall by the sword . I will judge you to the border of Israel ; so you shall know that I am the Lord .
26:11:011:0	This city will not be a pot for you , nor will you be flesh in the midst of it , but I will judge you to the border of Israel .
26:11:012:0	Thus you will know that I am the Lord ; for you have not walked in My statutes nor have you executed My ordinances , but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you . ” ’ ”
26:11:002:1	Promise of Restoration
26:11:013:0	Now it came about as I prophesied , that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died . Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said , “ Alas , Lord God ! Will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end ? ”
26:11:014:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:11:015:0	“ Son of man , your brothers , your relatives , your fellow exiles and the whole house of Israel , all of them , are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said , ‘Go far from the Lord ; this land has been given us as a possession . ’
26:11:016:0	Therefore say , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Though I had removed them far away among the nations and though I had scattered them among the countries , yet I was a sanctuary for them a little while in the countries where they had gone . ” ’
26:11:017:0	Therefore say , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel . ” ’
26:11:018:0	When they come there , they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it .
26:11:019:0	And I will give them one heart , and put a new spirit within them . And I will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh ,
26:11:020:0	that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them . Then they will be My people , and I shall be their God .
26:11:021:0	But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations , I will bring their conduct down on their heads , ” declares the Lord God .
26:11:022:0	Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them .
26:11:023:0	The glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is east of the city .
26:11:024:0	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea . So the vision that I had seen left me .
26:11:025:0	Then I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me .
