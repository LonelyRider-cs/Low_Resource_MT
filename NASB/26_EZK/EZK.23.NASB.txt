26:23:001:1	Oholah and Oholibah’s Sin and Its Consequences
26:23:001:0	The word of the Lord came to me again , saying ,
26:23:002:0	“ Son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother ;
26:23:003:0	and they played the harlot in Egypt . They played the harlot in their youth ; there their breasts were pressed and there their virgin bosom was handled .
26:23:004:0	Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister . And they became Mine , and they bore sons and daughters . And as for their names , Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah .
26:23:005:0	“ Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine ; and she lusted after her lovers , after the Assyrians , her neighbors ,
26:23:006:0	who were clothed in purple , governors and officials , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding on horses .
26:23:007:0	She bestowed her harlotries on them , all of whom were the choicest men of Assyria ; and with all whom she lusted after , with all their idols she defiled herself .
26:23:008:0	She did not forsake her harlotries from the time in Egypt ; for in her youth men had lain with her , and they handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her .
26:23:009:0	Therefore , I gave her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , after whom she lusted .
26:23:010:0	They uncovered her nakedness ; they took her sons and her daughters , but they slew her with the sword . Thus she became a byword among women , and they executed judgments on her .
26:23:011:0	“ Now her sister Oholibah saw this , yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she , and her harlotries were more than the harlotries of her sister .
26:23:012:0	She lusted after the Assyrians , governors and officials , the ones near , magnificently dressed , horsemen riding on horses , all of them desirable young men .
26:23:013:0	I saw that she had defiled herself ; they both took the same way .
26:23:014:0	So she increased her harlotries . And she saw men portrayed on the wall , images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion ,
26:23:015:0	girded with belts on their loins , with flowing turbans on their heads , all of them looking like officers , like the Babylonians in Chaldea , the land of their birth .
26:23:016:0	When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea .
26:23:017:0	The Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and defiled her with their harlotry . And when she had been defiled by them , she became disgusted with them .
26:23:018:0	She uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness ; then I became disgusted with her , as I had become disgusted with her sister .
26:23:019:0	Yet she multiplied her harlotries , remembering the days of her youth , when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
26:23:020:0	She lusted after their paramours , whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
26:23:021:0	Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth , when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth .
26:23:022:0	“ Therefore , O Oholibah , thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold I will arouse your lovers against you , from whom you were alienated , and I will bring them against you from every side :
26:23:023:0	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them ; desirable young men , governors and officials all of them , officers and men of renown , all of them riding on horses .
26:23:024:0	They will come against you with weapons , chariots and wagons , and with a company of peoples . They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet ; and I will commit the judgment to them , and they will judge you according to their customs .
26:23:025:0	I will set My jealousy against you , that they may deal with you in wrath . They will remove your nose and your ears ; and your survivors will fall by the sword . They will take your sons and your daughters ; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire .
26:23:026:0	They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels .
26:23:027:0	Thus I will make your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt to cease from you , so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore . ’
26:23:028:0	For thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold , I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate , into the hand of those from whom you were alienated .
26:23:029:0	They will deal with you in hatred , take all your property , and leave you naked and bare . And the nakedness of your harlotries will be uncovered , both your lewdness and your harlotries .
26:23:030:0	These things will be done to you because you have played the harlot with the nations , because you have defiled yourself with their idols .
26:23:031:0	You have walked in the way of your sister ; therefore I will give her cup into your hand . ’
26:23:032:0	Thus says the Lord God , ‘You will drink your sister’s cup , Which is deep and wide . You will be laughed at and held in derision ; It contains much .
26:23:033:0	You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , The cup of horror and desolation , The cup of your sister Samaria .
26:23:034:0	You will drink it and drain it . Then you will gnaw its fragmentsAnd tear your breasts ; for I have spoken , ’ declares the Lord God .
26:23:035:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , ‘Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back , bear now the punishment of your lewdness and your harlotries . ’ ”
26:23:036:0	Moreover , the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , will you judge Oholah and Oholibah ? Then declare to them their abominations .
26:23:037:0	For they have committed adultery , and blood is on their hands . Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons , whom they bore to Me , to pass through the fire to them as food .
26:23:038:0	Again , they have done this to Me : they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My sabbaths .
26:23:039:0	For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols , they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it ; and lo , thus they did within My house .
26:23:040:0	“ Furthermore , they have even sent for men who come from afar , to whom a messenger was sent ; and lo , they came—for whom you bathed , painted your eyes and decorated yourselves with ornaments ;
26:23:041:0	and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it on which you had set My incense and My oil .
26:23:042:0	The sound of a carefree multitude was with her ; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort . And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads .
26:23:043:0	“ Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries , ‘Will they now commit adultery with her when she is thus ? ’
26:23:044:0	But they went in to her as they would go in to a harlot . Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah , the lewd women .
26:23:045:0	But they , righteous men , will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood , because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands .
26:23:046:0	“ For thus says the Lord God , ‘Bring up a company against them and give them over to terror and plunder .
26:23:047:0	The company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords ; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire .
26:23:048:0	Thus I will make lewdness cease from the land , that all women may be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done .
26:23:049:0	Your lewdness will be requited upon you , and you will bear the penalty of worshiping your idols ; thus you will know that I am the Lord God . ’ ”
