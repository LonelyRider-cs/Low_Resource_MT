26:19:001:1	Lament for the Princes of Israel
26:19:001:0	“ As for you , take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel
26:19:002:0	and say , ‘What was your mother ? A lioness among lions ! She lay down among young lions , She reared her cubs .
26:19:003:0	When she brought up one of her cubs , He became a lion , And he learned to tear his prey ; He devoured men .
26:19:004:0	Then nations heard about him ; He was captured in their pit , And they brought him with hooksTo the land of Egypt .
26:19:005:0	When she saw , as she waited , That her hope was lost , She took another of her cubsAnd made him a young lion .
26:19:006:0	And he walked about among the lions ; He became a young lion , He learned to tear his prey ; He devoured men .
26:19:007:0	He destroyed their fortified towersAnd laid waste their cities ; And the land and its fullness were appalledBecause of the sound of his roaring .
26:19:008:0	Then nations set against himOn every side from their provinces , And they spread their net over him ; He was captured in their pit .
26:19:009:0	They put him in a cage with hooksAnd brought him to the king of Babylon ; They brought him in hunting netsSo that his voice would be heard no moreOn the mountains of Israel .
26:19:010:0	Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard , Planted by the waters ; It was fruitful and full of branchesBecause of abundant waters .
26:19:011:0	And it had strong branches fit for scepters of rulers , And its height was raised above the cloudsSo that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches .
26:19:012:0	But it was plucked up in fury ; It was cast down to the ground ; And the east wind dried up its fruit . Its strong branch was torn offSo that it withered ; The fire consumed it .
26:19:013:0	And now it is planted in the wilderness , In a dry and thirsty land .
26:19:014:0	And fire has gone out from its branch ; It has consumed its shoots and fruit , So that there is not in it a strong branch , A scepter to rule . ’ ” This is a lamentation , and has become a lamentation .
