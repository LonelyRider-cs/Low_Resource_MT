26:26:001:1	Judgment on Tyre
26:26:001:0	Now in the eleventh year , on the first of the month , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:26:002:0	“ Son of man , because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem , ‘Aha , the gateway of the peoples is broken ; it has opened to me . I shall be filled , now that she is laid waste , ’
26:26:003:0	therefore thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold , I am against you , O Tyre , and I will bring up many nations against you , as the sea brings up its waves .
26:26:004:0	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers ; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock .
26:26:005:0	She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea , for I have spoken , ’ declares the Lord God , ‘and she will become spoil for the nations .
26:26:006:0	Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be slain by the sword , and they will know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
26:26:007:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , king of kings , with horses , chariots , cavalry and a great army .
26:26:008:0	He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword ; and he will make siege walls against you , cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you .
26:26:009:0	The blow of his battering rams he will direct against your walls , and with his axes he will break down your towers .
26:26:010:0	Because of the multitude of his horses , the dust raised by them will cover you ; your walls will shake at the noise of cavalry and wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city that is breached .
26:26:011:0	With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets . He will slay your people with the sword ; and your strong pillars will come down to the ground .
26:26:012:0	Also they will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise , break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses , and throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water .
26:26:013:0	So I will silence the sound of your songs , and the sound of your harps will be heard no more .
26:26:014:0	I will make you a bare rock ; you will be a place for the spreading of nets . You will be built no more , for I the Lord have spoken , ” declares the Lord God .
26:26:015:0	Thus says the Lord God to Tyre , “ Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan , when the slaughter occurs in your midst ?
26:26:016:0	Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones , remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments . They will clothe themselves with trembling ; they will sit on the ground , tremble every moment and be appalled at you .
26:26:017:0	They will take up a lamentation over you and say to you , ‘How you have perished , O inhabited one , From the seas , O renowned city , Which was mighty on the sea , She and her inhabitants , Who imposed her terrorOn all her inhabitants !
26:26:018:0	Now the coastlands will trembleOn the day of your fall ; Yes , the coastlands which are by the seaWill be terrified at your passing . ’ ”
26:26:019:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ When I make you a desolate city , like the cities which are not inhabited , when I bring up the deep over you and the great waters cover you ,
26:26:020:0	then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit , to the people of old , and I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth , like the ancient waste places , with those who go down to the pit , so that you will not be inhabited ; but I will set glory in the land of the living .
26:26:021:0	I will bring terrors on you and you will be no more ; though you will be sought , you will never be found again , ” declares the Lord God .
