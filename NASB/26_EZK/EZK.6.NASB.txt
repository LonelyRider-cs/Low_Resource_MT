26:6:001:1	Idolatrous Worship Denounced
26:6:001:0	And the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:6:002:0	“ Son of man , set your face toward the mountains of Israel , and prophesy against them
26:6:003:0	and say , ‘Mountains of Israel , listen to the word of the Lord God ! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains , the hills , the ravines and the valleys : “ Behold , I Myself am going to bring a sword on you , and I will destroy your high places .
26:6:004:0	So your altars will become desolate and your incense altars will be smashed ; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols .
26:6:005:0	I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their idols ; and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
26:6:006:0	In all your dwellings , cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate , that your altars may become waste and desolate , your idols may be broken and brought to an end , your incense altars may be cut down , and your works may be blotted out .
26:6:007:0	The slain will fall among you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
26:6:008:0	“ However , I will leave a remnant , for you will have those who escaped the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries .
26:6:009:0	Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they will be carried captive , how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me , and by their eyes which played the harlot after their idols ; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed , for all their abominations .
26:6:010:0	Then they will know that I am the Lord ; I have not said in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them . ” ’
26:6:011:0	“ Thus says the Lord God , ‘Clap your hand , stamp your foot and say , “ Alas , because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel , which will fall by sword , famine and plague !
26:6:012:0	He who is far off will die by the plague , and he who is near will fall by the sword , and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine . Thus will I spend My wrath on them .
26:6:013:0	Then you will know that I am the Lord , when their slain are among their idols around their altars , on every high hill , on all the tops of the mountains , under every green tree and under every leafy oak—the places where they offered soothing aroma to all their idols .
26:6:014:0	So throughout all their habitations I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah ; thus they will know that I am the Lord . ” ’ ”
