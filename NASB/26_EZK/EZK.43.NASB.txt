26:43:001:1	Vision of the Glory of God Filling the Temple
26:43:001:0	Then he led me to the gate , the gate facing toward the east ;
26:43:002:0	and behold , the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east . And His voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth shone with His glory .
26:43:003:0	And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw , like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city . And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
26:43:004:0	And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate facing toward the east .
26:43:005:0	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house .
26:43:006:0	Then I heard one speaking to me from the house , while a man was standing beside me .
26:43:007:0	He said to me , “ Son of man , this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet , where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever . And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name , neither they nor their kings , by their harlotry and by the corpses of their kings when they die ,
26:43:008:0	by setting their threshold by My threshold and their door post beside My door post , with only the wall between Me and them . And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed . So I have consumed them in My anger .
26:43:009:0	Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from Me ; and I will dwell among them forever .
26:43:010:0	“ As for you , son of man , describe the temple to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities ; and let them measure the plan .
26:43:011:0	If they are ashamed of all that they have done , make known to them the design of the house , its structure , its exits , its entrances , all its designs , all its statutes , and all its laws . And write it in their sight , so that they may observe its whole design and all its statutes and do them .
26:43:002:1	The Altar of Sacrifice
26:43:012:0	This is the law of the house : its entire area on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy . Behold , this is the law of the house .
26:43:013:0	“ And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits ( the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth ) : the base shall be a cubit and the width a cubit , and its border on its edge round about one span ; and this shall be the height of the base of the altar .
26:43:014:0	From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits and the width one cubit ; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits and the width one cubit .
26:43:015:0	The altar hearth shall be four cubits ; and from the altar hearth shall extend upwards four horns .
26:43:016:0	Now the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide , square in its four sides .
26:43:003:1	The Offerings
26:43:017:0	The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides , the border around it shall be half a cubit and its base shall be a cubit round about ; and its steps shall face the east . ”
26:43:018:0	And He said to me , “ Son of man , thus says the Lord God , ‘These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built , to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it .
26:43:019:0	You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok , who draw near to Me to minister to Me , ’ declares the Lord God , ‘a young bull for a sin offering .
26:43:020:0	You shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns and on the four corners of the ledge and on the border round about ; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it .
26:43:021:0	You shall also take the bull for the sin offering , and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house , outside the sanctuary .
26:43:022:0	‘On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering , and they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull .
26:43:023:0	When you have finished cleansing it , you shall present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock .
26:43:024:0	You shall present them before the Lord , and the priests shall throw salt on them , and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord .
26:43:025:0	For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering ; also a young bull and a ram from the flock , without blemish , shall be prepared .
26:43:026:0	For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it ; so shall they consecrate it .
26:43:027:0	When they have completed the days , it shall be that on the eighth day and onward , the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , ’ declares the Lord God . ”
