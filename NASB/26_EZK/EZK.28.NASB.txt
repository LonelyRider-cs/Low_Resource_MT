26:28:001:1	Tyre’s King Overthrown
26:28:001:0	The word of the Lord came again to me , saying ,
26:28:002:0	“ Son of man , say to the leader of Tyre , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Because your heart is lifted upAnd you have said , ‘I am a god , I sit in the seat of godsIn the heart of the seas’ ; Yet you are a man and not God , Although you make your heart like the heart of God—
26:28:003:0	Behold , you are wiser than Daniel ; There is no secret that is a match for you .
26:28:004:0	By your wisdom and understandingYou have acquired riches for yourselfAnd have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries .
26:28:005:0	By your great wisdom , by your tradeYou have increased your richesAnd your heart is lifted up because of your riches—
26:28:006:0	Therefore thus says the Lord God , ‘Because you have made your heartLike the heart of God ,
26:28:007:0	Therefore , behold , I will bring strangers upon you , The most ruthless of the nations . And they will draw their swordsAgainst the beauty of your wisdomAnd defile your splendor .
26:28:008:0	They will bring you down to the pit , And you will die the death of those who are slainIn the heart of the seas .
26:28:009:0	Will you still say , “ I am a god , ” In the presence of your slayer , Though you are a man and not God , In the hands of those who wound you ?
26:28:010:0	You will die the death of the uncircumcisedBy the hand of strangers , For I have spoken ! ’ declares the Lord God ! ” ’ ”
26:28:011:0	Again the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:28:012:0	“ Son of man , take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ You had the seal of perfection , Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty .
26:28:013:0	You were in Eden , the garden of God ; Every precious stone was your covering : The ruby , the topaz and the diamond ; The beryl , the onyx and the jasper ; The lapis lazuli , the turquoise and the emerald ; And the gold , the workmanship of your settings and sockets , Was in you . On the day that you were createdThey were prepared .
26:28:014:0	You were the anointed cherub who covers , And I placed you there . You were on the holy mountain of God ; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire .
26:28:015:0	You were blameless in your waysFrom the day you were createdUntil unrighteousness was found in you .
26:28:016:0	By the abundance of your tradeYou were internally filled with violence , And you sinned ; Therefore I have cast you as profaneFrom the mountain of God . And I have destroyed you , O covering cherub , From the midst of the stones of fire .
26:28:017:0	Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor . I cast you to the ground ; I put you before kings , That they may see you .
26:28:018:0	By the multitude of your iniquities , In the unrighteousness of your tradeYou profaned your sanctuaries . Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you ; It has consumed you , And I have turned you to ashes on the earthIn the eyes of all who see you .
26:28:002:1	Judgment of Sidon
26:28:019:0	All who know you among the peoplesAre appalled at you ; You have become terrifiedAnd you will cease to be forever . ” ’ ”
26:28:020:0	And the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:28:021:0	“ Son of man , set your face toward Sidon , prophesy against her
26:28:022:0	and say , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I am against you , O Sidon , And I will be glorified in your midst . Then they will know that I am the Lord when I execute judgments in her , And I will manifest My holiness in her .
26:28:023:0	For I will send pestilence to herAnd blood to her streets , And the wounded will fall in her midstBy the sword upon her on every side ; Then they will know that I am the Lord .
26:28:003:1	Israel Regathered
26:28:024:0	And there will be no more for the house of Israel a prickling brier or a painful thorn from any round about them who scorned them ; then they will know that I am the Lord God . ”
26:28:025:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and will manifest My holiness in them in the sight of the nations , then they will live in their land which I gave to My servant Jacob .
26:28:026:0	They will live in it securely ; and they will build houses , plant vineyards and live securely when I execute judgments upon all who scorn them round about them . Then they will know that I am the Lord their God . ” ’ ”
