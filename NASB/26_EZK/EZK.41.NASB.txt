26:41:001:1	The Inner Temple
26:41:001:0	Then he brought me to the nave and measured the side pillars ; six cubits wide on each side was the width of the side pillar .
26:41:002:0	The width of the entrance was ten cubits and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side . And he measured the length of the nave , forty cubits , and the width , twenty cubits .
26:41:003:0	Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway , two cubits , and the doorway , six cubits high ; and the width of the doorway , seven cubits .
26:41:004:0	He measured its length , twenty cubits , and the width , twenty cubits , before the nave ; and he said to me , “ This is the most holy place . ”
26:41:005:0	Then he measured the wall of the temple , six cubits ; and the width of the side chambers , four cubits , all around about the house on every side .
26:41:006:0	The side chambers were in three stories , one above another , and thirty in each story ; and the side chambers extended to the wall which stood on their inward side all around , that they might be fastened , and not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself .
26:41:007:0	The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story . Because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on all sides of the temple , therefore the width of the temple increased as it went higher ; and thus one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the second story .
26:41:008:0	I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around ; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits in height .
26:41:009:0	The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits . But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple
26:41:010:0	and the outer chambers was twenty cubits in width all around the temple on every side .
26:41:011:0	The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space consisted of one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south ; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around .
26:41:012:0	The building that was in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around , and its length was ninety cubits .
26:41:013:0	Then he measured the temple , a hundred cubits long ; the separate area with the building and its walls were also a hundred cubits long .
26:41:014:0	Also the width of the front of the temple and that of the separate areas along the east side totaled a hundred cubits .
26:41:015:0	He measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it , with a gallery on each side , a hundred cubits ; he also measured the inner nave and the porches of the court .
26:41:016:0	The thresholds , the latticed windows and the galleries round about their three stories , opposite the threshold , were paneled with wood all around , and from the ground to the windows ( but the windows were covered ) ,
26:41:017:0	over the entrance , and to the inner house , and on the outside , and on all the wall all around inside and outside , by measurement .
26:41:018:0	It was carved with cherubim and palm trees ; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub , and every cherub had two faces ,
26:41:019:0	a man’s face toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion’s face toward the palm tree on the other side ; they were carved on all the house all around .
26:41:020:0	From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved , as well as on the wall of the nave .
26:41:021:0	The doorposts of the nave were square ; as for the front of the sanctuary , the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other .
26:41:022:0	The altar was of wood , three cubits high and its length two cubits ; its corners , its base and its sides were of wood . And he said to me , “ This is the table that is before the Lord . ”
26:41:023:0	The nave and the sanctuary each had a double door .
26:41:024:0	Each of the doors had two leaves , two swinging leaves ; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other .
26:41:025:0	Also there were carved on them , on the doors of the nave , cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the front of the porch outside .
26:41:026:0	There were latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other , on the sides of the porch ; thus were the side chambers of the house and the thresholds .
