26:24:001:1	Parable of the Boiling Pot
26:24:001:0	And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year , in the tenth month , on the tenth of the month , saying ,
26:24:002:0	“ Son of man , write the name of the day , this very day . The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day .
26:24:003:0	Speak a parable to the rebellious house and say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Put on the pot , put it on and also pour water in it ;
26:24:004:0	Put in it the pieces , Every good piece , the thigh and the shoulder ; Fill it with choice bones .
26:24:005:0	Take the choicest of the flock , And also pile wood under the pot . Make it boil vigorously . Also seethe its bones in it . ”
26:24:006:0	‘Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ Woe to the bloody city , To the pot in which there is rustAnd whose rust has not gone out of it ! Take out of it piece after piece , Without making a choice .
26:24:007:0	For her blood is in her midst ; She placed it on the bare rock ; She did not pour it on the groundTo cover it with dust .
26:24:008:0	That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have put her blood on the bare rock , That it may not be covered . ”
26:24:009:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ Woe to the bloody city ! I also will make the pile great .
26:24:010:0	Heap on the wood , kindle the fire , Boil the flesh wellAnd mix in the spices , And let the bones be burned .
26:24:011:0	Then set it empty on its coalsSo that it may be hotAnd its bronze may glowAnd its filthiness may be melted in it , Its rust consumed .
26:24:012:0	She has wearied Me with toil , Yet her great rust has not gone from her ; Let her rust be in the fire !
26:24:013:0	In your filthiness is lewdness . Because I would have cleansed you , Yet you are not clean , You will not be cleansed from your filthiness againUntil I have spent My wrath on you .
26:24:002:1	Death of Ezekiel’s Wife Is a Sign
26:24:014:0	I , the Lord , have spoken ; it is coming and I will act . I will not relent , and I will not pity and I will not be sorry ; according to your ways and according to your deeds I will judge you , ” declares the Lord God . ’ ”
26:24:015:0	And the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:24:016:0	“ Son of man , behold , I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow ; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep , and your tears shall not come .
26:24:017:0	Groan silently ; make no mourning for the dead . Bind on your turban and put your shoes on your feet , and do not cover your mustache and do not eat the bread of men . ”
26:24:018:0	So I spoke to the people in the morning , and in the evening my wife died . And in the morning I did as I was commanded .
26:24:019:0	The people said to me , “ Will you not tell us what these things that you are doing mean for us ? ”
26:24:020:0	Then I said to them , “ The word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:24:021:0	‘Speak to the house of Israel , “ Thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold , I am about to profane My sanctuary , the pride of your power , the desire of your eyes and the delight of your soul ; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword .
26:24:022:0	You will do as I have done ; you will not cover your mustache and you will not eat the bread of men .
26:24:023:0	Your turbans will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet . You will not mourn and you will not weep , but you will rot away in your iniquities and you will groan to one another .
26:24:024:0	Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you ; according to all that he has done you will do ; when it comes , then you will know that I am the Lord God . ’ ”
26:24:025:0	‘As for you , son of man , will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold , the joy of their pride , the desire of their eyes and their heart’s delight , their sons and their daughters ,
26:24:026:0	that on that day he who escapes will come to you with information for your ears ?
26:24:027:0	On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped , and you will speak and be mute no longer . Thus you will be a sign to them , and they will know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
