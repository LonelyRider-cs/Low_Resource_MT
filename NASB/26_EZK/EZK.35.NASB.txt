26:35:001:1	Prophecy against Mount Seir
26:35:001:0	Moreover , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:35:002:0	“ Son of man , set your face against Mount Seir , and prophesy against it
26:35:003:0	and say to it , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I am against you , Mount Seir , And I will stretch out My hand against youAnd make you a desolation and a waste .
26:35:004:0	I will lay waste your citiesAnd you will become a desolation . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:35:005:0	Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity , at the time of the punishment of the end ,
26:35:006:0	therefore as I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ I will give you over to bloodshed , and bloodshed will pursue you ; since you have not hated bloodshed , therefore bloodshed will pursue you .
26:35:007:0	I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation and I will cut off from it the one who passes through and returns .
26:35:008:0	I will fill its mountains with its slain ; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain by the sword will fall .
26:35:009:0	I will make you an everlasting desolation and your cities will not be inhabited . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:35:010:0	“ Because you have said , ‘These two nations and these two lands will be mine , and we will possess them , ’ although the Lord was there ,
26:35:011:0	therefore as I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy which you showed because of your hatred against them ; so I will make Myself known among them when I judge you .
26:35:012:0	Then you will know that I , the Lord , have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying , ‘They are laid desolate ; they are given to us for food . ’
26:35:013:0	And you have spoken arrogantly against Me and have multiplied your words against Me ; I have heard it . ”
26:35:014:0	Thus says the Lord God , “ As all the earth rejoices , I will make you a desolation .
26:35:015:0	As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate , so I will do to you . You will be a desolation , O Mount Seir , and all Edom , all of it . Then they will know that I am the Lord . ” ’
