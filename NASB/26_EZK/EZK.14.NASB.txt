26:14:001:1	Idolatrous Elders Condemned
26:14:001:0	Then some elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me .
26:14:002:0	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:14:003:0	“ Son of man , these men have set up their idols in their hearts and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of their iniquity . Should I be consulted by them at all ?
26:14:004:0	Therefore speak to them and tell them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Any man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart , puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity , and then comes to the prophet , I the Lord will be brought to give him an answer in the matter in view of the multitude of his idols ,
26:14:005:0	in order to lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who are estranged from Me through all their idols . ” ’
26:14:006:0	“ Therefore say to the house of Israel , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Repent and turn away from your idols and turn your faces away from all your abominations .
26:14:007:0	For anyone of the house of Israel or of the immigrants who stay in Israel who separates himself from Me , sets up his idols in his heart , puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity , and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me for himself , I the Lord will be brought to answer him in My own person .
26:14:008:0	I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from among My people . So you will know that I am the Lord .
26:14:009:0	“ But if the prophet is prevailed upon to speak a word , it is I , the Lord , who have prevailed upon that prophet , and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel .
26:14:010:0	They will bear the punishment of their iniquity ; as the iniquity of the inquirer is , so the iniquity of the prophet will be ,
26:14:002:1	The City Will Not Be Spared
26:14:011:0	in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions . Thus they will be My people , and I shall be their God , ” ’ declares the Lord God . ”
26:14:012:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:14:013:0	“ Son of man , if a country sins against Me by committing unfaithfulness , and I stretch out My hand against it , destroy its supply of bread , send famine against it and cut off from it both man and beast ,
26:14:014:0	even though these three men , Noah , Daniel and Job were in its midst , by their own righteousness they could only deliver themselves , ” declares the Lord God .
26:14:015:0	“ If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land and they depopulated it , and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it because of the beasts ,
26:14:016:0	though these three men were in its midst , as I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters . They alone would be delivered , but the country would be desolate .
26:14:017:0	Or if I should bring a sword on that country and say , ‘Let the sword pass through the country and cut off man and beast from it , ’
26:14:018:0	even though these three men were in its midst , as I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ they could not deliver either their sons or their daughters , but they alone would be delivered .
26:14:019:0	Or if I should send a plague against that country and pour out My wrath in blood on it to cut off man and beast from it ,
26:14:020:0	even though Noah , Daniel and Job were in its midst , as I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ they could not deliver either their son or their daughter . They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness . ”
26:14:021:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ How much more when I send My four severe judgments against Jerusalem : sword , famine , wild beasts and plague to cut off man and beast from it !
26:14:022:0	Yet , behold , survivors will be left in it who will be brought out , both sons and daughters . Behold , they are going to come forth to you and you will see their conduct and actions ; then you will be comforted for the calamity which I have brought against Jerusalem for everything which I have brought upon it .
26:14:023:0	Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions , for you will know that I have not done in vain whatever I did to it , ” declares the Lord God .
