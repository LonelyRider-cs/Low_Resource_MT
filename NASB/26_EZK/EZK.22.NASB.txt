26:22:001:1	The Sins of Israel
26:22:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:22:002:0	“ And you , son of man , will you judge , will you judge the bloody city ? Then cause her to know all her abominations .
26:22:003:0	You shall say , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ A city shedding blood in her midst , so that her time will come , and that makes idols , contrary to her interest , for defilement !
26:22:004:0	You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed , and defiled by your idols which you have made . Thus you have brought your day near and have come to your years ; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the lands .
26:22:005:0	Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you , you of ill repute , full of turmoil .
26:22:006:0	“ Behold , the rulers of Israel , each according to his power , have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood .
26:22:007:0	They have treated father and mother lightly within you . The alien they have oppressed in your midst ; the fatherless and the widow they have wronged in you .
26:22:008:0	You have despised My holy things and profaned My sabbaths .
26:22:009:0	Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood , and in you they have eaten at the mountain shrines . In your midst they have committed acts of lewdness .
26:22:010:0	In you they have uncovered their fathers’ nakedness ; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her menstrual impurity .
26:22:011:0	One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law . And another in you has humbled his sister , his father’s daughter .
26:22:012:0	In you they have taken bribes to shed blood ; you have taken interest and profits , and you have injured your neighbors for gain by oppression , and you have forgotten Me , ” declares the Lord God .
26:22:013:0	“ Behold , then , I smite My hand at your dishonest gain which you have acquired and at the bloodshed which is among you .
26:22:014:0	Can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong in the days that I will deal with you ? I , the Lord , have spoken and will act .
26:22:015:0	I will scatter you among the nations and I will disperse you through the lands , and I will consume your uncleanness from you .
26:22:016:0	You will profane yourself in the sight of the nations , and you will know that I am the Lord . ” ’ ”
26:22:017:0	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:22:018:0	“ Son of man , the house of Israel has become dross to Me ; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace ; they are the dross of silver .
26:22:019:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , ‘Because all of you have become dross , therefore , behold , I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
26:22:020:0	As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it , so I will gather you in My anger and in My wrath and I will lay you there and melt you .
26:22:021:0	I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath , and you will be melted in the midst of it .
26:22:022:0	As silver is melted in the furnace , so you will be melted in the midst of it ; and you will know that I , the Lord , have poured out My wrath on you . ’ ”
26:22:023:0	And the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:22:024:0	“ Son of man , say to her , ‘You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation . ’
26:22:025:0	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion tearing the prey . They have devoured lives ; they have taken treasure and precious things ; they have made many widows in the midst of her .
26:22:026:0	Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things ; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane , and they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean ; and they hide their eyes from My sabbaths , and I am profaned among them .
26:22:027:0	Her princes within her are like wolves tearing the prey , by shedding blood and destroying lives in order to get dishonest gain .
26:22:028:0	Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them , seeing false visions and divining lies for them , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord God , ’ when the Lord has not spoken .
26:22:029:0	The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery , and they have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner without justice .
26:22:030:0	I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land , so that I would not destroy it ; but I found no one .
26:22:031:0	Thus I have poured out My indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath ; their way I have brought upon their heads , ” declares the Lord God .
