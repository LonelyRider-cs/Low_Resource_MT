26:4:001:1	Siege of Jerusalem Predicted
26:4:001:0	“ Now you son of man , get yourself a brick , place it before you and inscribe a city on it , Jerusalem .
26:4:002:0	Then lay siege against it , build a siege wall , raise up a ramp , pitch camps and place battering rams against it all around .
26:4:003:0	Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city , and set your face toward it so that it is under siege , and besiege it . This is a sign to the house of Israel .
26:4:004:0	“ As for you , lie down on your left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it ; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it .
26:4:005:0	For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity , three hundred and ninety days ; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
26:4:006:0	When you have completed these , you shall lie down a second time , but on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah ; I have assigned it to you for forty days , a day for each year .
26:4:007:0	Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared and prophesy against it .
26:4:002:1	Defiled Bread
26:4:008:0	Now behold , I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege .
26:4:009:0	“ But as for you , take wheat , barley , beans , lentils , millet and spelt , put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself ; you shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side , three hundred and ninety days .
26:4:010:0	Your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight ; you shall eat it from time to time .
26:4:011:0	The water you drink shall be the sixth part of a hin by measure ; you shall drink it from time to time .
26:4:012:0	You shall eat it as a barley cake , having baked it in their sight over human dung . ”
26:4:013:0	Then the Lord said , “ Thus will the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will banish them . ”
26:4:014:0	But I said , “ Ah , Lord God ! Behold , I have never been defiled ; for from my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts , nor has any unclean meat ever entered my mouth . ”
26:4:015:0	Then He said to me , “ See , I will give you cow’s dung in place of human dung over which you will prepare your bread . ”
26:4:016:0	Moreover , He said to me , “ Son of man , behold , I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem , and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety , and drink water by measure and in horror ,
26:4:017:0	because bread and water will be scarce ; and they will be appalled with one another and waste away in their iniquity .
