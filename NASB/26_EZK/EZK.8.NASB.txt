26:8:001:1	Vision of Abominations in Jerusalem
26:8:001:0	It came about in the sixth year , on the fifth day of the sixth month , as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell on me there .
26:8:002:0	Then I looked , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of a man ; from His loins and downward there was the appearance of fire , and from His loins and upward the appearance of brightness , like the appearance of glowing metal .
26:8:003:0	He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head ; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem , to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court , where the seat of the idol of jealousy , which provokes to jealousy , was located .
26:8:004:0	And behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , like the appearance which I saw in the plain .
26:8:005:0	Then He said to me , “ Son of man , raise your eyes now toward the north . ” So I raised my eyes toward the north , and behold , to the north of the altar gate was this idol of jealousy at the entrance .
26:8:006:0	And He said to me , “ Son of man , do you see what they are doing , the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here , so that I would be far from My sanctuary ? But yet you will see still greater abominations . ”
26:8:007:0	Then He brought me to the entrance of the court , and when I looked , behold , a hole in the wall .
26:8:008:0	He said to me , “ Son of man , now dig through the wall . ” So I dug through the wall , and behold , an entrance .
26:8:009:0	And He said to me , “ Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here . ”
26:8:010:0	So I entered and looked , and behold , every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable things , with all the idols of the house of Israel , were carved on the wall all around .
26:8:011:0	Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel , with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them , each man with his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense rising .
26:8:012:0	Then He said to me , “ Son of man , do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark , each man in the room of his carved images ? For they say , ‘The Lord does not see us ; the Lord has forsaken the land . ’ ”
26:8:013:0	And He said to me , “ Yet you will see still greater abominations which they are committing . ”
26:8:014:0	Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the Lord’s house which was toward the north ; and behold , women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz .
26:8:015:0	He said to me , “ Do you see this , son of man ? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these . ”
26:8:016:0	Then He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house . And behold , at the entrance to the temple of the Lord , between the porch and the altar , were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east ; and they were prostrating themselves eastward toward the sun .
26:8:017:0	He said to me , “ Do you see this , son of man ? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they have committed here , that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me repeatedly ? For behold , they are putting the twig to their nose .
26:8:018:0	Therefore , I indeed will deal in wrath . My eye will have no pity nor will I spare ; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice , yet I will not listen to them . ”
