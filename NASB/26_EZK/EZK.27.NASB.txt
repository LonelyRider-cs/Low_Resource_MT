26:27:001:1	Lament over Tyre
26:27:001:0	Moreover , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:27:002:0	“ And you , son of man , take up a lamentation over Tyre ;
26:27:003:0	and say to Tyre , who dwells at the entrance to the sea , merchant of the peoples to many coastlands , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ O Tyre , you have said , ‘I am perfect in beauty . ’
26:27:004:0	Your borders are in the heart of the seas ; Your builders have perfected your beauty .
26:27:005:0	They have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir ; They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you .
26:27:006:0	Of oaks from Bashan they have made your oars ; With ivory they have inlaid your deck of boxwood from the coastlands of Cyprus .
26:27:007:0	Your sail was of fine embroidered linen from EgyptSo that it became your distinguishing mark ; Your awning was blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah .
26:27:008:0	The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers ; Your wise men , O Tyre , were aboard ; they were your pilots .
26:27:009:0	The elders of Gebal and her wise men were with you repairing your seams ; All the ships of the sea and their sailors were with you in order to deal in your merchandise .
26:27:010:0	“ Persia and Lud and Put were in your army , your men of war . They hung shield and helmet in you ; they set forth your splendor .
26:27:011:0	The sons of Arvad and your army were on your walls , all around , and the Gammadim were in your towers . They hung their shields on your walls all around ; they perfected your beauty .
26:27:012:0	“ Tarshish was your customer because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth ; with silver , iron , tin and lead they paid for your wares .
26:27:013:0	Javan , Tubal and Meshech , they were your traders ; with the lives of men and vessels of bronze they paid for your merchandise .
26:27:014:0	Those from Beth-togarmah gave horses and war horses and mules for your wares .
26:27:015:0	The sons of Dedan were your traders . Many coastlands were your market ; ivory tusks and ebony they brought as your payment .
26:27:016:0	Aram was your customer because of the abundance of your goods ; they paid for your wares with emeralds , purple , embroidered work , fine linen , coral and rubies .
26:27:017:0	Judah and the land of Israel , they were your traders ; with the wheat of Minnith , cakes , honey , oil and balm they paid for your merchandise .
26:27:018:0	Damascus was your customer because of the abundance of your goods , because of the abundance of all kinds of wealth , because of the wine of Helbon and white wool .
26:27:019:0	Vedan and Javan paid for your wares from Uzal ; wrought iron , cassia and sweet cane were among your merchandise .
26:27:020:0	Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding .
26:27:021:0	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar , they were your customers for lambs , rams and goats ; for these they were your customers .
26:27:022:0	The traders of Sheba and Raamah , they traded with you ; they paid for your wares with the best of all kinds of spices , and with all kinds of precious stones and gold .
26:27:023:0	Haran , Canneh , Eden , the traders of Sheba , Asshur and Chilmad traded with you .
26:27:024:0	They traded with you in choice garments , in clothes of blue and embroidered work , and in carpets of many colors and tightly wound cords , which were among your merchandise .
26:27:025:0	The ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your merchandise . And you were filled and were very gloriousIn the heart of the seas .
26:27:026:0	“ Your rowers have brought youInto great waters ; The east wind has broken youIn the heart of the seas .
26:27:027:0	Your wealth , your wares , your merchandise , Your sailors and your pilots , Your repairers of seams , your dealers in merchandiseAnd all your men of war who are in you , With all your company that is in your midst , Will fall into the heart of the seasOn the day of your overthrow .
26:27:028:0	At the sound of the cry of your pilotsThe pasture lands will shake .
26:27:029:0	All who handle the oar , The sailors and all the pilots of the seaWill come down from their ships ; They will stand on the land ,
26:27:030:0	And they will make their voice heard over youAnd will cry bitterly . They will cast dust on their heads , They will wallow in ashes .
26:27:031:0	Also they will make themselves bald for youAnd gird themselves with sackcloth ; And they will weep for you in bitterness of soulWith bitter mourning .
26:27:032:0	Moreover , in their wailing they will take up a lamentation for youAnd lament over you : ‘Who is like Tyre , Like her who is silent in the midst of the sea ?
26:27:033:0	When your wares went out from the seas , You satisfied many peoples ; With the abundance of your wealth and your merchandiseYou enriched the kings of earth .
26:27:034:0	Now that you are broken by the seasIn the depths of the waters , Your merchandise and all your companyHave fallen in the midst of you .
26:27:035:0	All the inhabitants of the coastlandsAre appalled at you , And their kings are horribly afraid ; They are troubled in countenance .
26:27:036:0	The merchants among the peoples hiss at you ; You have become terrifiedAnd you will cease to be forever . ’ ” ’ ”
