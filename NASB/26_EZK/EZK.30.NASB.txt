26:30:001:1	Lament over Egypt
26:30:001:0	The word of the Lord came again to me saying ,
26:30:002:0	“ Son of man , prophesy and say , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Wail , ‘Alas for the day ! ’
26:30:003:0	For the day is near , Even the day of the Lord is near ; It will be a day of clouds , A time of doom for the nations .
26:30:004:0	A sword will come upon Egypt , And anguish will be in Ethiopia ; When the slain fall in Egypt , They take away her wealth , And her foundations are torn down .
26:30:005:0	Ethiopia , Put , Lud , all Arabia , Libya and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword . ”
26:30:006:0	‘Thus says the Lord , “ Indeed , those who support Egypt will fallAnd the pride of her power will come down ; From Migdol to SyeneThey will fall within her by the sword , ” Declares the Lord God .
26:30:007:0	“ They will be desolateIn the midst of the desolated lands ; And her cities will beIn the midst of the devastated cities .
26:30:008:0	And they will know that I am the Lord , When I set a fire in EgyptAnd all her helpers are broken .
26:30:009:0	On that day messengers will go forth from Me in ships to frighten secure Ethiopia ; and anguish will be on them as on the day of Egypt ; for behold , it comes ! ”
26:30:010:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ I will also make the hordes of Egypt ceaseBy the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon .
26:30:011:0	He and his people with him , The most ruthless of the nations , Will be brought in to destroy the land ; And they will draw their swords against EgyptAnd fill the land with the slain .
26:30:012:0	Moreover , I will make the Nile canals dryAnd sell the land into the hands of evil men . And I will make the land desolateAnd all that is in it , By the hand of strangers ; I the Lord have spoken . ”
26:30:013:0	‘Thus says the Lord God , “ I will also destroy the idolsAnd make the images cease from Memphis . And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt ; And I will put fear in the land of Egypt .
26:30:014:0	I will make Pathros desolate , Set a fire in ZoanAnd execute judgments on Thebes .
26:30:015:0	I will pour out My wrath on Sin , The stronghold of Egypt ; I will also cut off the hordes of Thebes .
26:30:016:0	I will set a fire in Egypt ; Sin will writhe in anguish , Thebes will be breachedAnd Memphis will have distresses daily .
26:30:017:0	The young men of On and of Pi-besethWill fall by the sword , And the women will go into captivity .
26:30:018:0	In Tehaphnehes the day will be darkWhen I break there the yoke bars of Egypt . Then the pride of her power will cease in her ; A cloud will cover her , And her daughters will go into captivity .
26:30:002:1	Victory for Babylon
26:30:019:0	Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt , And they will know that I am the Lord . ” ’ ”
26:30:020:0	In the eleventh year , in the first month , on the seventh of the month , the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:30:021:0	“ Son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and , behold , it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage , that it may be strong to hold the sword .
26:30:022:0	Therefore thus says the Lord God , ‘Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms , both the strong and the broken ; and I will make the sword fall from his hand .
26:30:023:0	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands .
26:30:024:0	For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand ; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh , so that he will groan before him with the groanings of a wounded man .
26:30:025:0	Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , but the arms of Pharaoh will fall . Then they will know that I am the Lord , when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt .
26:30:026:0	When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands , then they will know that I am the Lord . ’ ”
