26:20:001:1	God’s Dealings with Israel Rehearsed
26:20:001:0	Now in the seventh year , in the fifth month , on the tenth of the month , certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord , and sat before me .
26:20:002:0	And the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
26:20:003:0	“ Son of man , speak to the elders of Israel and say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Do you come to inquire of Me ? As I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ I will not be inquired of by you . ” ’
26:20:004:0	Will you judge them , will you judge them , son of man ? Make them know the abominations of their fathers ;
26:20:005:0	and say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ On the day when I chose Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt , when I swore to them , saying , I am the Lord your God ,
26:20:006:0	on that day I swore to them , to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
26:20:007:0	I said to them , ‘Cast away , each of you , the detestable things of his eyes , and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am the Lord your God . ’
26:20:008:0	But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me ; they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes , nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt . Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them , to accomplish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt .
26:20:009:0	But I acted for the sake of My name , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived , in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt .
26:20:010:0	So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness .
26:20:011:0	I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances , by which , if a man observes them , he will live .
26:20:012:0	Also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them .
26:20:013:0	But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness . They did not walk in My statutes and they rejected My ordinances , by which , if a man observes them , he will live ; and My sabbaths they greatly profaned . Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness , to annihilate them .
26:20:014:0	But I acted for the sake of My name , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , before whose sight I had brought them out .
26:20:015:0	Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ,
26:20:016:0	because they rejected My ordinances , and as for My statutes , they did not walk in them ; they even profaned My sabbaths , for their heart continually went after their idols .
26:20:017:0	Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them , and I did not cause their annihilation in the wilderness .
26:20:018:0	“ I said to their children in the wilderness , ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols .
26:20:019:0	I am the Lord your God ; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and observe them .
26:20:020:0	Sanctify My sabbaths ; and they shall be a sign between Me and you , that you may know that I am the Lord your God . ’
26:20:021:0	But the children rebelled against Me ; they did not walk in My statutes , nor were they careful to observe My ordinances , by which , if a man observes them , he will live ; they profaned My sabbaths . So I resolved to pour out My wrath on them , to accomplish My anger against them in the wilderness .
26:20:022:0	But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out .
26:20:023:0	Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands ,
26:20:024:0	because they had not observed My ordinances , but had rejected My statutes and had profaned My sabbaths , and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers .
26:20:025:0	I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live ;
26:20:026:0	and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts , in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire so that I might make them desolate , in order that they might know that I am the Lord . ” ’
26:20:027:0	“ Therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel and say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me by acting treacherously against Me .
26:20:028:0	When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them , then they saw every high hill and every leafy tree , and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering . There also they made their soothing aroma and there they poured out their drink offerings .
26:20:029:0	Then I said to them , ‘What is the high place to which you go ? ’ So its name is called Bamah to this day . ” ’
26:20:030:0	Therefore , say to the house of Israel , ‘Thus says the Lord God , “ Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and play the harlot after their detestable things ?
26:20:031:0	When you offer your gifts , when you cause your sons to pass through the fire , you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day . And shall I be inquired of by you , O house of Israel ? As I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ I will not be inquired of by you .
26:20:002:1	God Will Restore Israel to Her Land
26:20:032:0	What comes into your mind will not come about , when you say : ‘We will be like the nations , like the tribes of the lands , serving wood and stone . ’
26:20:033:0	“ As I live , ” declares the Lord God , “ surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out , I shall be king over you .
26:20:034:0	I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered , with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out ;
26:20:035:0	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face .
26:20:036:0	As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so I will enter into judgment with you , ” declares the Lord God .
26:20:037:0	“ I will make you pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant ;
26:20:038:0	and I will purge from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me ; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn , but they will not enter the land of Israel . Thus you will know that I am the Lord .
26:20:039:0	“ As for you , O house of Israel , ” thus says the Lord God , “ Go , serve everyone his idols ; but later you will surely listen to Me , and My holy name you will profane no longer with your gifts and with your idols .
26:20:040:0	For on My holy mountain , on the high mountain of Israel , ” declares the Lord God , “ there the whole house of Israel , all of them , will serve Me in the land ; there I will accept them and there I will seek your contributions and the choicest of your gifts , with all your holy things .
26:20:041:0	As a soothing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered ; and I will prove Myself holy among you in the sight of the nations .
26:20:042:0	And you will know that I am the Lord , when I bring you into the land of Israel , into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers .
26:20:043:0	There you will remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves ; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done .
26:20:044:0	Then you will know that I am the Lord when I have dealt with you for My name’s sake , not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds , O house of Israel , ” declares the Lord God . ’ ”
26:20:045:0	Now the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
26:20:046:0	“ Son of man , set your face toward Teman , and speak out against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev ,
26:20:047:0	and say to the forest of the Negev , ‘Hear the word of the Lord : thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I am about to kindle a fire in you , and it will consume every green tree in you , as well as every dry tree ; the blazing flame will not be quenched and the whole surface from south to north will be burned by it .
26:20:048:0	All flesh will see that I , the Lord , have kindled it ; it shall not be quenched . ” ’ ”
26:20:049:0	Then I said , “ Ah Lord God ! They are saying of me , ‘Is he not just speaking parables ? ’ ”
