37:2:001:1	The Builders Encouraged
37:2:001:0	On the twenty-first of the seventh month , the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet saying ,
37:2:002:0	“ Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of the people saying ,
37:2:003:0	‘Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory ? And how do you see it now ? Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison ?
37:2:004:0	But now take courage , Zerubbabel , ’ declares the Lord , ‘take courage also , Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and all you people of the land take courage , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and work ; for I am with you , ’ declares the Lord of hosts .
37:2:005:0	‘As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt , My Spirit is abiding in your midst ; do not fear ! ’
37:2:006:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Once more in a little while , I am going to shake the heavens and the earth , the sea also and the dry land .
37:2:007:0	I will shake all the nations ; and they will come with the wealth of all nations , and I will fill this house with glory , ’ says the Lord of hosts .
37:2:008:0	‘The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine , ’ declares the Lord of hosts .
37:2:009:0	‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former , ’ says the Lord of hosts , ‘and in this place I will give peace , ’ declares the Lord of hosts . ”
37:2:010:0	On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , the word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet , saying ,
37:2:011:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Ask now the priests for a ruling :
37:2:012:0	If a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment , and touches bread with this fold , or cooked food , wine , oil , or any other food , will it become holy ? ’ ” And the priests answered , “ No . ”
37:2:013:0	Then Haggai said , “ If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these , will the latter become unclean ? ” And the priests answered , “ It will become unclean . ”
37:2:014:0	Then Haggai said , “ ‘So is this people . And so is this nation before Me , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and so is every work of their hands ; and what they offer there is unclean .
37:2:015:0	But now , do consider from this day onward : before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the Lord ,
37:2:016:0	from that time when one came to a grain heap of twenty measures , there would be only ten ; and when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures , there would be only twenty .
37:2:017:0	I smote you and every work of your hands with blasting wind , mildew and hail ; yet you did not come back to Me , ’ declares the Lord .
37:2:018:0	‘Do consider from this day onward , from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month ; from the day when the temple of the Lord was founded , consider :
37:2:019:0	Is the seed still in the barn ? Even including the vine , the fig tree , the pomegranate and the olive tree , it has not borne fruit . Yet from this day on I will bless you . ’ ”
37:2:020:0	Then the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month , saying ,
37:2:021:0	“ Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah , saying , ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth .
37:2:022:0	I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations ; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders , and the horses and their riders will go down , everyone by the sword of another . ’
37:2:023:0	‘On that day , ’ declares the Lord of hosts , ‘I will take you , Zerubbabel , son of Shealtiel , My servant , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will make you like a signet ring , for I have chosen you , ’ ” declares the Lord of hosts .
