47:13:001:1	Examine Yourselves
47:13:001:0	This is the third time I am coming to you . Every fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
47:13:002:0	I have previously said when present the second time , and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well , that if I come again I will not spare anyone ,
47:13:003:0	since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me , and who is not weak toward you , but mighty in you .
47:13:004:0	For indeed He was crucified because of weakness , yet He lives because of the power of God . For we also are weak in Him , yet we will live with Him because of the power of God directed toward you .
47:13:005:0	Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith ; examine yourselves ! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves , that Jesus Christ is in youâ€”unless indeed you fail the test ?
47:13:006:0	But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test .
47:13:007:0	Now we pray to God that you do no wrong ; not that we ourselves may appear approved , but that you may do what is right , even though we may appear unapproved .
47:13:008:0	For we can do nothing against the truth , but only for the truth .
47:13:009:0	For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong ; this we also pray for , that you be made complete .
47:13:010:0	For this reason I am writing these things while absent , so that when present I need not use severity , in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down .
47:13:011:0	Finally , brethren , rejoice , be made complete , be comforted , be like-minded , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace will be with you .
47:13:012:0	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47:13:013:0	All the saints greet you .
47:13:014:0	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit , be with you all .
