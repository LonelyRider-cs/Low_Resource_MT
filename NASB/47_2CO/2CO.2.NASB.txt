47:2:001:1	Reaffirm Your Love
47:2:001:0	But I determined this for my own sake , that I would not come to you in sorrow again .
47:2:002:0	For if I cause you sorrow , who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful ?
47:2:003:0	This is the very thing I wrote you , so that when I came , I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice ; having confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all .
47:2:004:0	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears ; not so that you would be made sorrowful , but that you might know the love which I have especially for you .
47:2:005:0	But if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow not to me , but in some degree—in order not to say too much—to all of you .
47:2:006:0	Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority ,
47:2:007:0	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him , otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
47:2:008:0	Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him .
47:2:009:0	For to this end also I wrote , so that I might put you to the test , whether you are obedient in all things .
47:2:010:0	But one whom you forgive anything , I forgive also ; for indeed what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ ,
47:2:011:0	so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan , for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
47:2:012:0	Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord ,
47:2:013:0	I had no rest for my spirit , not finding Titus my brother ; but taking my leave of them , I went on to Macedonia .
47:2:014:0	But thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place .
47:2:015:0	For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing ;
47:2:016:0	to the one an aroma from death to death , to the other an aroma from life to life . And who is adequate for these things ?
47:2:017:0	For we are not like many , peddling the word of God , but as from sincerity , but as from God , we speak in Christ in the sight of God .
