47:4:001:1	Paul’s Apostolic Ministry
47:4:001:0	Therefore , since we have this ministry , as we received mercy , we do not lose heart ,
47:4:002:0	but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame , not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God , but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God .
47:4:003:0	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing ,
47:4:004:0	in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
47:4:005:0	For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake .
47:4:006:0	For God , who said , “ Light shall shine out of darkness , ” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ .
47:4:007:0	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves ;
47:4:008:0	we are afflicted in every way , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not despairing ;
47:4:009:0	persecuted , but not forsaken ; struck down , but not destroyed ;
47:4:010:0	always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body .
47:4:011:0	For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus’ sake , so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
47:4:012:0	So death works in us , but life in you .
47:4:013:0	But having the same spirit of faith , according to what is written , “ I believed , therefore I spoke , ” we also believe , therefore we also speak ,
47:4:014:0	knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you .
47:4:015:0	For all things are for your sakes , so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God .
47:4:016:0	Therefore we do not lose heart , but though our outer man is decaying , yet our inner man is being renewed day by day .
47:4:017:0	For momentary , light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison ,
47:4:018:0	while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen ; for the things which are seen are temporal , but the things which are not seen are eternal .
