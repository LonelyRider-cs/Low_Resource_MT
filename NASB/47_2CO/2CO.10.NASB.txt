47:10:001:1	Paul Describes Himself
47:10:001:0	Now I , Paul , myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when face to face with you , but bold toward you when absent !
47:10:002:0	I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some , who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh .
47:10:003:0	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war according to the flesh ,
47:10:004:0	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses .
47:10:005:0	We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God , and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ ,
47:10:006:0	and we are ready to punish all disobedience , whenever your obedience is complete .
47:10:007:0	You are looking at things as they are outwardly . If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ’s , let him consider this again within himself , that just as he is Christ’s , so also are we .
47:10:008:0	For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you , I will not be put to shame ,
47:10:009:0	for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters .
47:10:010:0	For they say , “ His letters are weighty and strong , but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible . ”
47:10:011:0	Let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when absent , such persons we are also in deed when present .
47:10:012:0	For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves ; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they are without understanding .
47:10:013:0	But we will not boast beyond our measure , but within the measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure , to reach even as far as you .
47:10:014:0	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we did not reach to you , for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ ;
47:10:015:0	not boasting beyond our measure , that is , in other men’s labors , but with the hope that as your faith grows , we will be , within our sphere , enlarged even more by you ,
47:10:016:0	so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you , and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another .
47:10:017:0	But he who boasts is to boast in the Lord .
47:10:018:0	For it is not he who commends himself that is approved , but he whom the Lord commends .
