47:9:001:1	God Gives Most
47:9:001:0	For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints ;
47:9:002:0	for I know your readiness , of which I boast about you to the Macedonians , namely , that Achaia has been prepared since last year , and your zeal has stirred up most of them .
47:9:003:0	But I have sent the brethren , in order that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case , so that , as I was saying , you may be prepared ;
47:9:004:0	otherwise if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we—not to speak of you—will be put to shame by this confidence .
47:9:005:0	So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift , so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not affected by covetousness .
47:9:006:0	Now this I say , he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
47:9:007:0	Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver .
47:9:008:0	And God is able to make all grace abound to you , so that always having all sufficiency in everything , you may have an abundance for every good deed ;
47:9:009:0	as it is written , “ He scattered abroad , he gave to the poor , His righteousness endures forever . ”
47:9:010:0	Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness ;
47:9:011:0	you will be enriched in everything for all liberality , which through us is producing thanksgiving to God .
47:9:012:0	For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints , but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God .
47:9:013:0	Because of the proof given by this ministry , they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all ,
47:9:014:0	while they also , by prayer on your behalf , yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you .
47:9:015:0	Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift !
