47:5:001:1	The Temporal and Eternal
47:5:001:0	For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
47:5:002:0	For indeed in this house we groan , longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven ,
47:5:003:0	inasmuch as we , having put it on , will not be found naked .
47:5:004:0	For indeed while we are in this tent , we groan , being burdened , because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed , so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life .
47:5:005:0	Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God , who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge .
47:5:006:0	Therefore , being always of good courage , and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—
47:5:007:0	for we walk by faith , not by sight—
47:5:008:0	we are of good courage , I say , and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord .
47:5:009:0	Therefore we also have as our ambition , whether at home or absent , to be pleasing to Him .
47:5:010:0	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
47:5:011:0	Therefore , knowing the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are made manifest to God ; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences .
47:5:012:0	We are not again commending ourselves to you but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us , so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart .
47:5:013:0	For if we are beside ourselves , it is for God ; if we are of sound mind , it is for you .
47:5:014:0	For the love of Christ controls us , having concluded this , that one died for all , therefore all died ;
47:5:015:0	and He died for all , so that they who live might no longer live for themselves , but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf .
47:5:016:0	Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh ; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now we know Him in this way no longer .
47:5:017:0	Therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creature ; the old things passed away ; behold , new things have come .
47:5:018:0	Now all these things are from God , who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation ,
47:5:019:0	namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself , not counting their trespasses against them , and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation .
47:5:020:0	Therefore , we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God were making an appeal through us ; we beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
47:5:021:0	He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf , so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him .
