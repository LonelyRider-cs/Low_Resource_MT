47:3:001:1	Ministers of a New Covenant
47:3:001:0	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Or do we need , as some , letters of commendation to you or from you ?
47:3:002:0	You are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men ;
47:3:003:0	being manifested that you are a letter of Christ , cared for by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
47:3:004:0	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God .
47:3:005:0	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves , but our adequacy is from God ,
47:3:006:0	who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant , not of the letter but of the Spirit ; for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47:3:007:0	But if the ministry of death , in letters engraved on stones , came with glory , so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face , fading as it was ,
47:3:008:0	how will the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory ?
47:3:009:0	For if the ministry of condemnation has glory , much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory .
47:3:010:0	For indeed what had glory , in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it .
47:3:011:0	For if that which fades away was with glory , much more that which remains is in glory .
47:3:012:0	Therefore having such a hope , we use great boldness in our speech ,
47:3:013:0	and are not like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was fading away .
47:3:014:0	But their minds were hardened ; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted , because it is removed in Christ .
47:3:015:0	But to this day whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their heart ;
47:3:016:0	but whenever a person turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47:3:017:0	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
47:3:018:0	But we all , with unveiled face , beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory , just as from the Lord , the Spirit .
