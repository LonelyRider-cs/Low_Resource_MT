47:12:001:1	Paul’s Vision
47:12:001:0	Boasting is necessary , though it is not profitable ; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47:12:002:0	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know , or out of the body I do not know , God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven .
47:12:003:0	And I know how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know , God knows—
47:12:004:0	was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words , which a man is not permitted to speak .
47:12:005:0	On behalf of such a man I will boast ; but on my own behalf I will not boast , except in regard to my weaknesses .
47:12:002:1	A Thorn in the Flesh
47:12:006:0	For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish , for I will be speaking the truth ; but I refrain from this , so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me .
47:12:007:0	Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations , for this reason , to keep me from exalting myself , there was given me a thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself !
47:12:008:0	Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me .
47:12:009:0	And He has said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , for power is perfected in weakness . ” Most gladly , therefore , I will rather boast about my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may dwell in me .
47:12:010:0	Therefore I am well content with weaknesses , with insults , with distresses , with persecutions , with difficulties , for Christ’s sake ; for when I am weak , then I am strong .
47:12:011:0	I have become foolish ; you yourselves compelled me . Actually I should have been commended by you , for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles , even though I am a nobody .
47:12:012:0	The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance , by signs and wonders and miracles .
47:12:013:0	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches , except that I myself did not become a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
47:12:014:0	Here for this third time I am ready to come to you , and I will not be a burden to you ; for I do not seek what is yours , but you ; for children are not responsible to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
47:12:015:0	I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls . If I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
47:12:016:0	But be that as it may , I did not burden you myself ; nevertheless , crafty fellow that I am , I took you in by deceit .
47:12:017:0	Certainly I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you , have I ?
47:12:018:0	I urged Titus to go , and I sent the brother with him . Titus did not take any advantage of you , did he ? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps ?
47:12:019:0	All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you . Actually , it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ ; and all for your upbuilding , beloved .
47:12:020:0	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish ; that perhaps there will be strife , jealousy , angry tempers , disputes , slanders , gossip , arrogance , disturbances ;
47:12:021:0	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you , and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity , immorality and sensuality which they have practiced .
