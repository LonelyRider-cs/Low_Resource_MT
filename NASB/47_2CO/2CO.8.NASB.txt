47:8:001:1	Great Generosity
47:8:001:0	Now , brethren , we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia ,
47:8:002:0	that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality .
47:8:003:0	For I testify that according to their ability , and beyond their ability , they gave of their own accord ,
47:8:004:0	begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints ,
47:8:005:0	and this , not as we had expected , but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God .
47:8:006:0	So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning , so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well .
47:8:007:0	But just as you abound in everything , in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you , see that you abound in this gracious work also .
47:8:008:0	I am not speaking this as a command , but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also .
47:8:009:0	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though He was rich , yet for your sake He became poor , so that you through His poverty might become rich .
47:8:010:0	I give my opinion in this matter , for this is to your advantage , who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this , but also to desire to do it .
47:8:011:0	But now finish doing it also , so that just as there was the readiness to desire it , so there may be also the completion of it by your ability .
47:8:012:0	For if the readiness is present , it is acceptable according to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
47:8:013:0	For this is not for the ease of others and for your affliction , but by way of equality—
47:8:014:0	at this present time your abundance being a supply for their need , so that their abundance also may become a supply for your need , that there may be equality ;
47:8:015:0	as it is written , “ He who gathered much did not have too much , and he who gathered little had no lack . ”
47:8:016:0	But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus .
47:8:017:0	For he not only accepted our appeal , but being himself very earnest , he has gone to you of his own accord .
47:8:018:0	We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in the things of the gospel has spread through all the churches ;
47:8:019:0	and not only this , but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work , which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself , and to show our readiness ,
47:8:020:0	taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift ;
47:8:021:0	for we have regard for what is honorable , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
47:8:022:0	We have sent with them our brother , whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things , but now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you .
47:8:023:0	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker among you ; as for our brethren , they are messengers of the churches , a glory to Christ .
47:8:024:0	Therefore openly before the churches , show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you .
