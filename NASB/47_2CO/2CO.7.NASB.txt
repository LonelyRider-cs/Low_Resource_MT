47:7:001:1	Paul Reveals His Heart
47:7:001:0	Therefore , having these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
47:7:002:0	Make room for us in your hearts ; we wronged no one , we corrupted no one , we took advantage of no one .
47:7:003:0	I do not speak to condemn you , for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together .
47:7:004:0	Great is my confidence in you ; great is my boasting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort ; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction .
47:7:005:0	For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest , but we were afflicted on every side : conflicts without , fears within .
47:7:006:0	But God , who comforts the depressed , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
47:7:007:0	and not only by his coming , but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you , as he reported to us your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me ; so that I rejoiced even more .
47:7:008:0	For though I caused you sorrow by my letter , I do not regret it ; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow , though only for a while—
47:7:009:0	I now rejoice , not that you were made sorrowful , but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance ; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God , so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us .
47:7:010:0	For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret , leading to salvation , but the sorrow of the world produces death .
47:7:011:0	For behold what earnestness this very thing , this godly sorrow , has produced in you : what vindication of yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what avenging of wrong ! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter .
47:7:012:0	So although I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended , but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God .
47:7:013:0	For this reason we have been comforted . And besides our comfort , we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
47:7:014:0	For if in anything I have boasted to him about you , I was not put to shame ; but as we spoke all things to you in truth , so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth .
47:7:015:0	His affection abounds all the more toward you , as he remembers the obedience of you all , how you received him with fear and trembling .
47:7:016:0	I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you .
