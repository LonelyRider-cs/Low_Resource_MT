47:11:001:1	Paul Defends His Apostleship
47:11:001:0	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness ; but indeed you are bearing with me .
47:11:002:0	For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy ; for I betrothed you to one husband , so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin .
47:11:003:0	But I am afraid that , as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness , your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ .
47:11:004:0	For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached , or you receive a different spirit which you have not received , or a different gospel which you have not accepted , you bear this beautifully .
47:11:005:0	For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles .
47:11:006:0	But even if I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not so in knowledge ; in fact , in every way we have made this evident to you in all things .
47:11:007:0	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted , because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge ?
47:11:008:0	I robbed other churches by taking wages from them to serve you ;
47:11:009:0	and when I was present with you and was in need , I was not a burden to anyone ; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully supplied my need , and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you , and will continue to do so .
47:11:010:0	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia .
47:11:011:0	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
47:11:012:0	But what I am doing I will continue to do , so that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting .
47:11:013:0	For such men are false apostles , deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
47:11:014:0	No wonder , for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
47:11:015:0	Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness , whose end will be according to their deeds .
47:11:016:0	Again I say , let no one think me foolish ; but if you do , receive me even as foolish , so that I also may boast a little .
47:11:017:0	What I am saying , I am not saying as the Lord would , but as in foolishness , in this confidence of boasting .
47:11:018:0	Since many boast according to the flesh , I will boast also .
47:11:019:0	For you , being so wise , tolerate the foolish gladly .
47:11:020:0	For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you , anyone devours you , anyone takes advantage of you , anyone exalts himself , anyone hits you in the face .
47:11:021:0	To my shame I must say that we have been weak by comparison . But in whatever respect anyone else is bold—I speak in foolishness—I am just as bold myself .
47:11:022:0	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47:11:023:0	Are they servants of Christ ? —I speak as if insane—I more so ; in far more labors , in far more imprisonments , beaten times without number , often in danger of death .
47:11:024:0	Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine lashes .
47:11:025:0	Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was stoned , three times I was shipwrecked , a night and a day I have spent in the deep .
47:11:026:0	I have been on frequent journeys , in dangers from rivers , dangers from robbers , dangers from my countrymen , dangers from the Gentiles , dangers in the city , dangers in the wilderness , dangers on the sea , dangers among false brethren ;
47:11:027:0	I have been in labor and hardship , through many sleepless nights , in hunger and thirst , often without food , in cold and exposure .
47:11:028:0	Apart from such external things , there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches .
47:11:029:0	Who is weak without my being weak ? Who is led into sin without my intense concern ?
47:11:030:0	If I have to boast , I will boast of what pertains to my weakness .
47:11:031:0	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , He who is blessed forever , knows that I am not lying .
47:11:032:0	In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me ,
47:11:033:0	and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall , and so escaped his hands .
