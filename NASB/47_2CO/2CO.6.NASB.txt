47:6:001:1	Their Ministry Commended
47:6:001:0	And working together with Him , we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain—
47:6:002:0	for He says , “ At the acceptable time I listened to you , And on the day of salvation I helped you . ” Behold , now is “ the acceptable time , ” behold , now is “ the day of salvation ” —
47:6:003:0	giving no cause for offense in anything , so that the ministry will not be discredited ,
47:6:004:0	but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God , in much endurance , in afflictions , in hardships , in distresses ,
47:6:005:0	in beatings , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labors , in sleeplessness , in hunger ,
47:6:006:0	in purity , in knowledge , in patience , in kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in genuine love ,
47:6:007:0	in the word of truth , in the power of God ; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left ,
47:6:008:0	by glory and dishonor , by evil report and good report ; regarded as deceivers and yet true ;
47:6:009:0	as unknown yet well-known , as dying yet behold , we live ; as punished yet not put to death ,
47:6:010:0	as sorrowful yet always rejoicing , as poor yet making many rich , as having nothing yet possessing all things .
47:6:011:0	Our mouth has spoken freely to you , O Corinthians , our heart is opened wide .
47:6:012:0	You are not restrained by us , but you are restrained in your own affections .
47:6:013:0	Now in a like exchange—I speak as to children—open wide to us also .
47:6:014:0	Do not be bound together with unbelievers ; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness , or what fellowship has light with darkness ?
47:6:015:0	Or what harmony has Christ with Belial , or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever ?
47:6:016:0	Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ; just as God said , “ I will dwell in them and walk among them ; And I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
47:6:017:0	Therefore , come out from their midst and be separate , ” says the Lord . “ And do not touch what is unclean ; And I will welcome you .
47:6:018:0	And I will be a father to you , And you shall be sons and daughters to Me , ” Says the Lord Almighty .
