11:9:001:1	God’s Promise and Warning
11:9:001:0	Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord , and the king’s house , and all that Solomon desired to do ,
11:9:002:0	that the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time , as He had appeared to him at Gibeon .
11:9:003:0	The Lord said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and your supplication , which you have made before Me ; I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name there forever , and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually .
11:9:004:0	As for you , if you will walk before Me as your father David walked , in integrity of heart and uprightness , doing according to all that I have commanded you and will keep My statutes and My ordinances ,
11:9:005:0	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , just as I promised to your father David , saying , ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel . ’
11:9:006:0	“ But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me , and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you , and go and serve other gods and worship them ,
11:9:007:0	then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them , and the house which I have consecrated for My name , I will cast out of My sight . So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
11:9:008:0	And this house will become a heap of ruins ; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say , ‘Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house ? ’
11:9:002:1	Cities Given to Hiram
11:9:009:0	And they will say , ‘Because they forsook the Lord their God , who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt , and adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them , therefore the Lord has brought all this adversity on them . ’ ”
11:9:010:0	It came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord and the king’s house
11:9:011:0	( Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold according to all his desire ) , then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
11:9:012:0	So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him , and they did not please him .
11:9:013:0	He said , “ What are these cities which you have given me , my brother ? ” So they were called the land of Cabul to this day .
11:9:014:0	And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold .
11:9:015:0	Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the Lord , his own house , the Millo , the wall of Jerusalem , Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer .
11:9:016:0	For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire , and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city , and had given it as a dowry to his daughter , Solomon’s wife .
11:9:017:0	So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon
11:9:018:0	and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness , in the land of Judah ,
11:9:019:0	and all the storage cities which Solomon had , even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen , and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem , in Lebanon , and in all the land under his rule .
11:9:020:0	As for all the people who were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites and the Jebusites , who were not of the sons of Israel ,
11:9:021:0	their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel were unable to destroy utterly , from them Solomon levied forced laborers , even to this day .
11:9:022:0	But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel ; for they were men of war , his servants , his princes , his captains , his chariot commanders , and his horsemen .
11:9:023:0	These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work , five hundred and fifty , who ruled over the people doing the work .
11:9:024:0	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her , then he built the Millo .
11:9:025:0	Now three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord , burning incense with them on the altar which was before the Lord . So he finished the house .
11:9:026:0	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber , which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
11:9:027:0	And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet , sailors who knew the sea , along with the servants of Solomon .
11:9:028:0	They went to Ophir and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there , and brought it to King Solomon .
