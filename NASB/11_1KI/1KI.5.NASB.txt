11:5:001:1	Alliance with King Hiram
11:5:001:0	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon , when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father , for Hiram had always been a friend of David .
11:5:002:0	Then Solomon sent word to Hiram , saying ,
11:5:003:0	“ You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which surrounded him , until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet .
11:5:004:0	But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side ; there is neither adversary nor misfortune .
11:5:005:0	Behold , I intend to build a house for the name of the Lord my God , as the Lord spoke to David my father , saying , ‘Your son , whom I will set on your throne in your place , he will build the house for My name . ’
11:5:006:0	Now therefore , command that they cut for me cedars from Lebanon , and my servants will be with your servants ; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say , for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians . ”
11:5:007:0	When Hiram heard the words of Solomon , he rejoiced greatly and said , “ Blessed be the Lord today , who has given to David a wise son over this great people . ”
11:5:008:0	So Hiram sent word to Solomon , saying , “ I have heard the message which you have sent me ; I will do what you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber .
11:5:009:0	My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea ; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place where you direct me , and I will have them broken up there , and you shall carry them away . Then you shall accomplish my desire by giving food to my household . ”
11:5:010:0	So Hiram gave Solomon as much as he desired of the cedar and cypress timber .
11:5:011:0	Solomon then gave Hiram 20 , 000 kors of wheat as food for his household , and twenty kors of beaten oil ; thus Solomon would give Hiram year by year .
11:5:002:1	Conscription of Laborers
11:5:012:0	The Lord gave wisdom to Solomon , just as He promised him ; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon , and the two of them made a covenant .
11:5:013:0	Now King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel ; and the forced laborers numbered 30 , 000 men .
11:5:014:0	He sent them to Lebanon , 10 , 000 a month in relays ; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home . And Adoniram was over the forced laborers .
11:5:015:0	Now Solomon had 70 , 000 transporters , and 80 , 000 hewers of stone in the mountains ,
11:5:016:0	besides Solomon’s 3 , 300 chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work .
11:5:017:0	Then the king commanded , and they quarried great stones , costly stones , to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones .
11:5:018:0	So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them , and prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house .
