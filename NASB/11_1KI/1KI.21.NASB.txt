11:21:001:1	Ahab Covets Naboth’s Vineyard
11:21:001:0	Now it came about after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria .
11:21:002:0	Ahab spoke to Naboth , saying , “ Give me your vineyard , that I may have it for a vegetable garden because it is close beside my house , and I will give you a better vineyard than it in its place ; if you like , I will give you the price of it in money . ”
11:21:003:0	But Naboth said to Ahab , “ The Lord forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers . ”
11:21:004:0	So Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him ; for he said , “ I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers . ” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and ate no food .
11:21:005:0	But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him , “ How is it that your spirit is so sullen that you are not eating food ? ”
11:21:006:0	So he said to her , “ Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him , ‘Give me your vineyard for money ; or else , if it pleases you , I will give you a vineyard in its place . ’ But he said , ‘I will not give you my vineyard . ’ ”
11:21:007:0	Jezebel his wife said to him , “ Do you now reign over Israel ? Arise , eat bread , and let your heart be joyful ; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite . ”
11:21:008:0	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal , and sent letters to the elders and to the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city .
11:21:009:0	Now she wrote in the letters , saying , “ Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people ;
11:21:002:1	Jezebel’s Plot
11:21:010:0	and seat two worthless men before him , and let them testify against him , saying , ‘You cursed God and the king . ’ Then take him out and stone him to death . ”
11:21:011:0	So the men of his city , the elders and the nobles who lived in his city , did as Jezebel had sent word to them , just as it was written in the letters which she had sent them .
11:21:012:0	They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people .
11:21:013:0	Then the two worthless men came in and sat before him ; and the worthless men testified against him , even against Naboth , before the people , saying , “ Naboth cursed God and the king . ” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones .
11:21:014:0	Then they sent word to Jezebel , saying , “ Naboth has been stoned and is dead . ”
11:21:015:0	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead , Jezebel said to Ahab , “ Arise , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth , the Jezreelite , which he refused to give you for money ; for Naboth is not alive , but dead . ”
11:21:016:0	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
11:21:017:0	Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
11:21:018:0	“ Arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who is in Samaria ; behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it .
11:21:019:0	You shall speak to him , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Have you murdered and also taken possession ? ” ’ And you shall speak to him , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth the dogs will lick up your blood , even yours . ” ’ ”
11:21:020:0	Ahab said to Elijah , “ Have you found me , O my enemy ? ” And he answered , “ I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord .
11:21:021:0	Behold , I will bring evil upon you , and will utterly sweep you away , and will cut off from Ahab every male , both bond and free in Israel ;
11:21:022:0	and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger , and because you have made Israel sin .
11:21:023:0	Of Jezebel also has the Lord spoken , saying , ‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel . ’
11:21:024:0	The one belonging to Ahab , who dies in the city , the dogs will eat , and the one who dies in the field the birds of heaven will eat . ”
11:21:025:0	Surely there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord , because Jezebel his wife incited him .
11:21:026:0	He acted very abominably in following idols , according to all that the Amorites had done , whom the Lord cast out before the sons of Israel .
11:21:027:0	It came about when Ahab heard these words , that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted , and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently .
11:21:028:0	Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
11:21:029:0	“ Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me ? Because he has humbled himself before Me , I will not bring the evil in his days , but I will bring the evil upon his house in his son’s days . ”
