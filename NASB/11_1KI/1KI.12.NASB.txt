11:12:001:1	King Rehoboam Acts Foolishly
11:12:001:0	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem , for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king .
11:12:002:0	Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it , he was living in Egypt ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon ) .
11:12:003:0	Then they sent and called him , and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
11:12:004:0	“ Your father made our yoke hard ; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us , and we will serve you . ”
11:12:005:0	Then he said to them , “ Depart for three days , then return to me . ” So the people departed .
11:12:006:0	King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive , saying , “ How do you counsel me to answer this people ? ”
11:12:007:0	Then they spoke to him , saying , “ If you will be a servant to this people today , and will serve them and grant them their petition , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . ”
11:12:008:0	But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him , and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him .
11:12:009:0	So he said to them , “ What counsel do you give that we may answer this people who have spoken to me , saying , ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’ ? ”
11:12:010:0	The young men who grew up with him spoke to him , saying , “ Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you , saying , ‘Your father made our yoke heavy , now you make it lighter for us ! ’ But you shall speak to them , ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins !
11:12:011:0	Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke ; my father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions . ’ ”
11:12:012:0	Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed , saying , “ Return to me on the third day . ”
11:12:013:0	The king answered the people harshly , for he forsook the advice of the elders which they had given him ,
11:12:014:0	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men , saying , “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to your yoke ; my father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions . ”
11:12:002:1	The Kingdom Divided ; Jeroboam Rules Israel
11:12:015:0	So the king did not listen to the people ; for it was a turn of events from the Lord , that He might establish His word , which the Lord spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
11:12:016:0	When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them , the people answered the king , saying , “ What portion do we have in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse ; To your tents , O Israel ! Now look after your own house , David ! ” So Israel departed to their tents .
11:12:017:0	But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
11:12:018:0	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the forced labor , and all Israel stoned him to death . And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem .
11:12:019:0	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
11:12:020:0	It came about when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned , that they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel . None but the tribe of Judah followed the house of David .
11:12:021:0	Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin , 180 , 000 chosen men who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
11:12:022:0	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
11:12:023:0	“ Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people , saying ,
11:12:003:1	Jeroboam’s Idolatry
11:12:024:0	‘Thus says the Lord , “ You must not go up and fight against your relatives the sons of Israel ; return every man to his house , for this thing has come from Me . ” ’ ” So they listened to the word of the Lord , and returned and went their way according to the word of the Lord .
11:12:025:0	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and lived there . And he went out from there and built Penuel .
11:12:026:0	Jeroboam said in his heart , “ Now the kingdom will return to the house of David .
11:12:027:0	If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will return to their lord , even to Rehoboam king of Judah ; and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah . ”
11:12:028:0	So the king consulted , and made two golden calves , and he said to them , “ It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem ; behold your gods , O Israel , that brought you up from the land of Egypt . ”
11:12:029:0	He set one in Bethel , and the other he put in Dan .
11:12:030:0	Now this thing became a sin , for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan .
11:12:031:0	And he made houses on high places , and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi .
11:12:032:0	Jeroboam instituted a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month , like the feast which is in Judah , and he went up to the altar ; thus he did in Bethel , sacrificing to the calves which he had made . And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made .
11:12:033:0	Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised in his own heart ; and he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense .
