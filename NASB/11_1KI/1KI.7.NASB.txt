11:7:001:1	Solomon’s Palace
11:7:001:0	Now Solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
11:7:002:0	He built the house of the forest of Lebanon ; its length was 100 cubits and its width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits , on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars .
11:7:003:0	It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the 45 pillars , 15 in each row .
11:7:004:0	There were artistic window frames in three rows , and window was opposite window in three ranks .
11:7:005:0	All the doorways and doorposts had squared artistic frames , and window was opposite window in three ranks .
11:7:006:0	Then he made the hall of pillars ; its length was 50 cubits and its width 30 cubits , and a porch was in front of them and pillars and a threshold in front of them .
11:7:007:0	He made the hall of the throne where he was to judge , the hall of judgment , and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor .
11:7:008:0	His house where he was to live , the other court inward from the hall , was of the same workmanship . He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter , whom Solomon had married .
11:7:009:0	All these were of costly stones , of stone cut according to measure , sawed with saws , inside and outside ; even from the foundation to the coping , and so on the outside to the great court .
11:7:010:0	The foundation was of costly stones , even large stones , stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits .
11:7:011:0	And above were costly stones , stone cut according to measure , and cedar .
11:7:002:1	Hiram’s Work in the Temple
11:7:012:0	So the great court all around had three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams even as the inner court of the house of the Lord , and the porch of the house .
11:7:013:0	Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre .
11:7:014:0	He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali , and his father was a man of Tyre , a worker in bronze ; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze . So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work .
11:7:015:0	He fashioned the two pillars of bronze ; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar , and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both .
11:7:016:0	He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars ; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits .
11:7:017:0	There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital .
11:7:018:0	So he made the pillars , and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates ; and so he did for the other capital .
11:7:019:0	The capitals which were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily design , four cubits .
11:7:020:0	There were capitals on the two pillars , even above and close to the rounded projection which was beside the network ; and the pomegranates numbered two hundred in rows around both capitals .
11:7:021:0	Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave ; and he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin , and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz .
11:7:022:0	On the top of the pillars was lily design . So the work of the pillars was finished .
11:7:023:0	Now he made the sea of cast metal ten cubits from brim to brim , circular in form , and its height was five cubits , and thirty cubits in circumference .
11:7:024:0	Under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit , completely surrounding the sea ; the gourds were in two rows , cast with the rest .
11:7:025:0	It stood on twelve oxen , three facing north , three facing west , three facing south , and three facing east ; and the sea was set on top of them , and all their rear parts turned inward .
11:7:026:0	It was a handbreadth thick , and its brim was made like the brim of a cup , as a lily blossom ; it could hold two thousand baths .
11:7:027:0	Then he made the ten stands of bronze ; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits .
11:7:028:0	This was the design of the stands : they had borders , even borders between the frames ,
11:7:029:0	and on the borders which were between the frames were lions , oxen and cherubim ; and on the frames there was a pedestal above , and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work .
11:7:030:0	Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles , and its four feet had supports ; beneath the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side .
11:7:031:0	Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit , and its opening was round like the design of a pedestal , a cubit and a half ; and also on its opening there were engravings , and their borders were square , not round .
11:7:032:0	The four wheels were underneath the borders , and the axles of the wheels were on the stand . And the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half .
11:7:033:0	The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel . Their axles , their rims , their spokes , and their hubs were all cast .
11:7:034:0	Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand ; its supports were part of the stand itself .
11:7:035:0	On the top of the stand there was a circular form half a cubit high , and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were part of it .
11:7:036:0	He engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders , cherubim , lions and palm trees , according to the clear space on each , with wreaths all around .
11:7:037:0	He made the ten stands like this : all of them had one casting , one measure and one form .
11:7:038:0	He made ten basins of bronze , one basin held forty baths ; each basin was four cubits , and on each of the ten stands was one basin .
11:7:039:0	Then he set the stands , five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house ; and he set the sea of cast metal on the right side of the house eastward toward the south .
11:7:040:0	Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls . So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of the Lord :
11:7:041:0	the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ;
11:7:042:0	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars ;
11:7:043:0	and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands ;
11:7:044:0	and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea ;
11:7:045:0	and the pails and the shovels and the bowls ; even all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the Lord were of polished bronze .
11:7:046:0	In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan .
11:7:047:0	Solomon left all the utensils unweighed , because they were too many ; the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained .
11:7:048:0	Solomon made all the furniture which was in the house of the Lord : the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence ;
11:7:049:0	and the lampstands , five on the right side and five on the left , in front of the inner sanctuary , of pure gold ; and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs , of gold ;
11:7:050:0	and the cups and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the firepans , of pure gold ; and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , that is , of the nave , of gold .
11:7:051:0	Thus all the work that King Solomon performed in the house of the Lord was finished . And Solomon brought in the things dedicated by his father David , the silver and the gold and the utensils , and he put them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord .
