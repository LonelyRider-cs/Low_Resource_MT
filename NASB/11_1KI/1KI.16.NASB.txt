11:16:001:1	Prophecy against Baasha
11:16:001:0	Now the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha , saying ,
11:16:002:0	“ Inasmuch as I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel , and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin , provoking Me to anger with their sins ,
11:16:003:0	behold , I will consume Baasha and his house , and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
11:16:004:0	Anyone of Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat , and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat . ”
11:16:002:1	The Israelite Kings
11:16:005:0	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
11:16:006:0	And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah , and Elah his son became king in his place .
11:16:007:0	Moreover , the word of the Lord through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani also came against Baasha and his household , both because of all the evil which he did in the sight of the Lord , provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands , in being like the house of Jeroboam , and because he struck it .
11:16:008:0	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah , Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah , and reigned two years .
11:16:009:0	His servant Zimri , commander of half his chariots , conspired against him . Now he was at Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was over the household at Tirzah .
11:16:010:0	Then Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and became king in his place .
11:16:011:0	It came about when he became king , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he killed all the household of Baasha ; he did not leave a single male , neither of his relatives nor of his friends .
11:16:012:0	Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha , according to the word of the Lord , which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet ,
11:16:013:0	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son , which they sinned and which they made Israel sin , provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their idols .
11:16:014:0	Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
11:16:015:0	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days at Tirzah . Now the people were camped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
11:16:016:0	The people who were camped heard it said , “ Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king . ” Therefore all Israel made Omri , the commander of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
11:16:017:0	Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah .
11:16:018:0	When Zimri saw that the city was taken , he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with fire , and died ,
11:16:019:0	because of his sins which he sinned , doing evil in the sight of the Lord , walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , making Israel sin .
11:16:020:0	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
11:16:021:0	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; the other half followed Omri .
11:16:022:0	But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath . And Tibni died and Omri became king .
11:16:023:0	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah , Omri became king over Israel and reigned twelve years ; he reigned six years at Tirzah .
11:16:024:0	He bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver ; and he built on the hill , and named the city which he built Samaria , after the name of Shemer , the owner of the hill .
11:16:025:0	Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord , and acted more wickedly than all who were before him .
11:16:026:0	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins which he made Israel sin , provoking the Lord God of Israel with their idols .
11:16:027:0	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he showed , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
11:16:028:0	So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria ; and Ahab his son became king in his place .
11:16:029:0	Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah , and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years .
11:16:030:0	Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him .
11:16:031:0	It came about , as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians , and went to serve Baal and worshiped him .
11:16:032:0	So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Samaria .
11:16:033:0	Ahab also made the Asherah . Thus Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
11:16:034:0	In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho ; he laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn , and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub , according to the word of the Lord , which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun .
