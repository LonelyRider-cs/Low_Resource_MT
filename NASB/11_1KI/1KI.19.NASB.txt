11:19:001:1	Elijah Flees from Jezebel
11:19:001:0	Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done , and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword .
11:19:002:0	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah , saying , “ So may the gods do to me and even more , if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time . ”
11:19:003:0	And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
11:19:004:0	But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness , and came and sat down under a juniper tree ; and he requested for himself that he might die , and said , “ It is enough ; now , O Lord , take my life , for I am not better than my fathers . ”
11:19:005:0	He lay down and slept under a juniper tree ; and behold , there was an angel touching him , and he said to him , “ Arise , eat . ”
11:19:006:0	Then he looked and behold , there was at his head a bread cake baked on hot stones , and a jar of water . So he ate and drank and lay down again .
11:19:007:0	The angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said , “ Arise , eat , because the journey is too great for you . ”
11:19:002:1	Elijah at Horeb
11:19:008:0	So he arose and ate and drank , and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb , the mountain of God .
11:19:009:0	Then he came there to a cave and lodged there ; and behold , the word of the Lord came to him , and He said to him , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
11:19:010:0	He said , “ I have been very zealous for the Lord , the God of hosts ; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant , torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword . And I alone am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away . ”
11:19:011:0	So He said , “ Go forth and stand on the mountain before the Lord . ” And behold , the Lord was passing by ! And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord ; but the Lord was not in the wind . And after the wind an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
11:19:012:0	After the earthquake a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire ; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing .
11:19:013:0	When Elijah heard it , he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave . And behold , a voice came to him and said , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
11:19:014:0	Then he said , “ I have been very zealous for the Lord , the God of hosts ; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant , torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword . And I alone am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away . ”
11:19:015:0	The Lord said to him , “ Go , return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus , and when you have arrived , you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram ;
11:19:016:0	and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint king over Israel ; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place .
11:19:017:0	It shall come about , the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael , Jehu shall put to death , and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu , Elisha shall put to death .
11:19:018:0	Yet I will leave 7 , 000 in Israel , all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him . ”
11:19:019:0	So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat , while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him , and he with the twelfth . And Elijah passed over to him and threw his mantle on him .
11:19:020:0	He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said , “ Please let me kiss my father and my mother , then I will follow you . ” And he said to him , “ Go back again , for what have I done to you ? ”
11:19:021:0	So he returned from following him , and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen , and gave it to the people and they ate . Then he arose and followed Elijah and ministered to him .
