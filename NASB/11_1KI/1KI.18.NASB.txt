11:18:001:1	Obadiah Meets Elijah
11:18:001:0	Now it happened after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year , saying , “ Go , show yourself to Ahab , and I will send rain on the face of the earth . ”
11:18:002:0	So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab . Now the famine was severe in Samaria .
11:18:003:0	Ahab called Obadiah who was over the household . ( Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly ;
11:18:004:0	for when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the Lord , Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave , and provided them with bread and water . )
11:18:005:0	Then Ahab said to Obadiah , “ Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys ; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive , and not have to kill some of the cattle . ”
11:18:006:0	So they divided the land between them to survey it ; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself .
11:18:007:0	Now as Obadiah was on the way , behold , Elijah met him , and he recognized him and fell on his face and said , “ Is this you , Elijah my master ? ”
11:18:008:0	He said to him , “ It is I . Go , say to your master , ‘Behold , Elijah is here . ’ ”
11:18:009:0	He said , “ What sin have I committed , that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to put me to death ?
11:18:010:0	As the Lord your God lives , there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you ; and when they said , ‘He is not here , ’ he made the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you .
11:18:011:0	And now you are saying , ‘Go , say to your master , “ Behold , Elijah is here . ” ’
11:18:012:0	It will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the Lord will carry you where I do not know ; so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you , he will kill me , although I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth .
11:18:013:0	Has it not been told to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord , that I hid a hundred prophets of the Lord by fifties in a cave , and provided them with bread and water ?
11:18:014:0	And now you are saying , ‘Go , say to your master , “ Behold , Elijah is here ” ’ ; he will then kill me . ”
11:18:015:0	Elijah said , “ As the Lord of hosts lives , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself to him today . ”
11:18:016:0	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him ; and Ahab went to meet Elijah .
11:18:017:0	When Ahab saw Elijah , Ahab said to him , “ Is this you , you troubler of Israel ? ”
11:18:018:0	He said , “ I have not troubled Israel , but you and your father’s house have , because you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and you have followed the Baals .
11:18:002:1	God or Baal on Mount Carmel
11:18:019:0	Now then send and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel , together with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah , who eat at Jezebel’s table . ”
11:18:020:0	So Ahab sent a message among all the sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel .
11:18:021:0	Elijah came near to all the people and said , “ How long will you hesitate between two opinions ? If the Lord is God , follow Him ; but if Baal , follow him . ” But the people did not answer him a word .
11:18:022:0	Then Elijah said to the people , “ I alone am left a prophet of the Lord , but Baal’s prophets are 450 men .
11:18:023:0	Now let them give us two oxen ; and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up , and place it on the wood , but put no fire under it ; and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood , and I will not put a fire under it .
11:18:024:0	Then you call on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of the Lord , and the God who answers by fire , He is God . ” And all the people said , “ That is a good idea . ”
11:18:025:0	So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many , and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . ”
11:18:026:0	Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying , “ O Baal , answer us . ” But there was no voice and no one answered . And they leaped about the altar which they made .
11:18:027:0	It came about at noon , that Elijah mocked them and said , “ Call out with a loud voice , for he is a god ; either he is occupied or gone aside , or is on a journey , or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened . ”
11:18:028:0	So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them .
11:18:029:0	When midday was past , they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice ; but there was no voice , no one answered , and no one paid attention .
11:18:030:0	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Come near to me . ” So all the people came near to him . And he repaired the altar of the Lord which had been torn down .
11:18:031:0	Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of the Lord had come , saying , “ Israel shall be your name . ”
11:18:032:0	So with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord , and he made a trench around the altar , large enough to hold two measures of seed .
11:18:033:0	Then he arranged the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid it on the wood .
11:18:034:0	And he said , “ Fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood . ” And he said , “ Do it a second time , ” and they did it a second time . And he said , “ Do it a third time , ” and they did it a third time .
11:18:003:1	Elijah’s Prayer
11:18:035:0	The water flowed around the altar and he also filled the trench with water .
11:18:036:0	At the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , Elijah the prophet came near and said , “ O Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , today let it be known that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and I have done all these things at Your word .
11:18:037:0	Answer me , O Lord , answer me , that this people may know that You , O Lord , are God , and that You have turned their heart back again . ”
11:18:038:0	Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
11:18:039:0	When all the people saw it , they fell on their faces ; and they said , “ The Lord , He is God ; the Lord , He is God . ”
11:18:040:0	Then Elijah said to them , “ Seize the prophets of Baal ; do not let one of them escape . ” So they seized them ; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon , and slew them there .
11:18:041:0	Now Elijah said to Ahab , “ Go up , eat and drink ; for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower . ”
11:18:042:0	So Ahab went up to eat and drink . But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he crouched down on the earth and put his face between his knees .
11:18:043:0	He said to his servant , “ Go up now , look toward the sea . ” So he went up and looked and said , “ There is nothing . ” And he said , “ Go back ” seven times .
11:18:044:0	It came about at the seventh time , that he said , “ Behold , a cloud as small as a man’s hand is coming up from the sea . ” And he said , “ Go up , say to Ahab , ‘Prepare your chariot and go down , so that the heavy shower does not stop you . ’ ”
11:18:045:0	In a little while the sky grew black with clouds and wind , and there was a heavy shower . And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel .
11:18:046:0	Then the hand of the Lord was on Elijah , and he girded up his loins and outran Ahab to Jezreel .
