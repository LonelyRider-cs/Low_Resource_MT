11:14:001:1	Ahijah Prophesies against the King
11:14:001:0	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick .
11:14:002:0	Jeroboam said to his wife , “ Arise now , and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam , and go to Shiloh ; behold , Ahijah the prophet is there , who spoke concerning me that I would be king over this people .
11:14:003:0	Take ten loaves with you , some cakes and a jar of honey , and go to him . He will tell you what will happen to the boy . ”
11:14:004:0	Jeroboam’s wife did so , and arose and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . Now Ahijah could not see , for his eyes were dim because of his age .
11:14:005:0	Now the Lord had said to Ahijah , “ Behold , the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son , for he is sick . You shall say thus and thus to her , for it will be when she arrives that she will pretend to be another woman . ”
11:14:006:0	When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway , he said , “ Come in , wife of Jeroboam , why do you pretend to be another woman ? For I am sent to you with a harsh message .
11:14:007:0	Go , say to Jeroboam , ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel , “ Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over My people Israel ,
11:14:008:0	and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—yet you have not been like My servant David , who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart , to do only that which was right in My sight ;
11:14:009:0	you also have done more evil than all who were before you , and have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger , and have cast Me behind your back—
11:14:010:0	therefore behold , I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam , and will cut off from Jeroboam every male person , both bond and free in Israel , and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam , as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone .
11:14:011:0	Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs will eat . And he who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat ; for the Lord has spoken it . ” ’
11:14:012:0	Now you , arise , go to your house . When your feet enter the city the child will die .
11:14:013:0	All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him , for he alone of Jeroboam’s family will come to the grave , because in him something good was found toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam .
11:14:014:0	Moreover , the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and from now on .
11:14:015:0	“ For the Lord will strike Israel , as a reed is shaken in the water ; and He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers , and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River , because they have made their Asherim , provoking the Lord to anger .
11:14:016:0	He will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam , which he committed and with which he made Israel to sin . ”
11:14:017:0	Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah . As she was entering the threshold of the house , the child died .
11:14:018:0	All Israel buried him and mourned for him , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet .
11:14:019:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he made war and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel .
11:14:002:1	Rehoboam Misleads Judah
11:14:020:0	The time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years ; and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his place .
11:14:021:0	Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah . Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name there . And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess .
11:14:022:0	Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers had done , with the sins which they committed .
11:14:023:0	For they also built for themselves high places and sacred pillars and Asherim on every high hill and beneath every luxuriant tree .
11:14:024:0	There were also male cult prostitutes in the land . They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord dispossessed before the sons of Israel .
11:14:025:0	Now it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam , that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem .
11:14:026:0	He took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house , and he took everything , even taking all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
11:14:027:0	So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place , and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king’s house .
11:14:028:0	Then it happened as often as the king entered the house of the Lord , that the guards would carry them and would bring them back into the guards’ room .
11:14:029:0	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
11:14:030:0	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
11:14:031:0	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess . And Abijam his son became king in his place .
