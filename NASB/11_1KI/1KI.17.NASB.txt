11:17:001:1	Elijah Predicts Drought
11:17:001:0	Now Elijah the Tishbite , who was of the settlers of Gilead , said to Ahab , “ As the Lord , the God of Israel lives , before whom I stand , surely there shall be neither dew nor rain these years , except by my word . ”
11:17:002:0	The word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
11:17:003:0	“ Go away from here and turn eastward , and hide yourself by the brook Cherith , which is east of the Jordan .
11:17:004:0	It shall be that you will drink of the brook , and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there . ”
11:17:005:0	So he went and did according to the word of the Lord , for he went and lived by the brook Cherith , which is east of the Jordan .
11:17:006:0	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening , and he would drink from the brook .
11:17:007:0	It happened after a while that the brook dried up , because there was no rain in the land .
11:17:008:0	Then the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
11:17:009:0	“ Arise , go to Zarephath , which belongs to Sidon , and stay there ; behold , I have commanded a widow there to provide for you . ”
11:17:010:0	So he arose and went to Zarephath , and when he came to the gate of the city , behold , a widow was there gathering sticks ; and he called to her and said , “ Please get me a little water in a jar , that I may drink . ”
11:17:011:0	As she was going to get it , he called to her and said , “ Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand . ”
11:17:012:0	But she said , “ As the Lord your God lives , I have no bread , only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar ; and behold , I am gathering a few sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my son , that we may eat it and die . ”
11:17:013:0	Then Elijah said to her , “ Do not fear ; go , do as you have said , but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out to me , and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son .
11:17:014:0	For thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘The bowl of flour shall not be exhausted , nor shall the jar of oil be empty , until the day that the Lord sends rain on the face of the earth . ’ ”
11:17:015:0	So she went and did according to the word of Elijah , and she and he and her household ate for many days .
11:17:002:1	Elijah Raises the Widow’s Son
11:17:016:0	The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty , according to the word of the Lord which He spoke through Elijah .
11:17:017:0	Now it came about after these things that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , became sick ; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him .
11:17:018:0	So she said to Elijah , “ What do I have to do with you , O man of God ? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son to death ! ”
11:17:019:0	He said to her , “ Give me your son . ” Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living , and laid him on his own bed .
11:17:020:0	He called to the Lord and said , “ O Lord my God , have You also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying , by causing her son to die ? ”
11:17:021:0	Then he stretched himself upon the child three times , and called to the Lord and said , “ O Lord my God , I pray You , let this child’s life return to him . ”
11:17:022:0	The Lord heard the voice of Elijah , and the life of the child returned to him and he revived .
11:17:023:0	Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother ; and Elijah said , “ See , your son is alive . ”
11:17:024:0	Then the woman said to Elijah , “ Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth . ”
