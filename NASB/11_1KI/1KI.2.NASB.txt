11:2:001:1	David’s Charge to Solomon
11:2:001:0	As David’s time to die drew near , he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
11:2:002:0	“ I am going the way of all the earth . Be strong , therefore , and show yourself a man .
11:2:003:0	Keep the charge of the Lord your God , to walk in His ways , to keep His statutes , His commandments , His ordinances , and His testimonies , according to what is written in the Law of Moses , that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn ,
11:2:004:0	so that the Lord may carry out His promise which He spoke concerning me , saying , ‘If your sons are careful of their way , to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel . ’
11:2:005:0	“ Now you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me , what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel , to Abner the son of Ner , and to Amasa the son of Jether , whom he killed ; he also shed the blood of war in peace . And he put the blood of war on his belt about his waist , and on his sandals on his feet .
11:2:006:0	So act according to your wisdom , and do not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace .
11:2:007:0	But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be among those who eat at your table ; for they assisted me when I fled from Absalom your brother .
11:2:008:0	Behold , there is with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite , of Bahurim ; now it was he who cursed me with a violent curse on the day I went to Mahanaim . But when he came down to me at the Jordan , I swore to him by the Lord , saying , ‘I will not put you to death with the sword . ’
11:2:002:1	Death of David
11:2:009:0	Now therefore , do not let him go unpunished , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you will bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood . ”
11:2:010:0	Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David .
11:2:011:0	The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years he reigned in Hebron and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem .
11:2:012:0	And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father , and his kingdom was firmly established .
11:2:013:0	Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . And she said , “ Do you come peacefully ? ” And he said , “ Peacefully . ”
11:2:014:0	Then he said , “ I have something to say to you . ” And she said , “ Speak . ”
11:2:015:0	So he said , “ You know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel expected me to be king ; however , the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s , for it was his from the Lord .
11:2:016:0	Now I am making one request of you ; do not refuse me . ” And she said to him , “ Speak . ”
11:2:017:0	Then he said , “ Please speak to Solomon the king , for he will not refuse you , that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife . ”
11:2:003:1	Adonijah Executed
11:2:018:0	Bathsheba said , “ Very well ; I will speak to the king for you . ”
11:2:019:0	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah . And the king arose to meet her , bowed before her , and sat on his throne ; then he had a throne set for the king’s mother , and she sat on his right .
11:2:020:0	Then she said , “ I am making one small request of you ; do not refuse me . ” And the king said to her , “ Ask , my mother , for I will not refuse you . ”
11:2:021:0	So she said , “ Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife . ”
11:2:022:0	King Solomon answered and said to his mother , “ And why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? Ask for him also the kingdom—for he is my older brother—even for him , for Abiathar the priest , and for Joab the son of Zeruiah ! ”
11:2:023:0	Then King Solomon swore by the Lord , saying , “ May God do so to me and more also , if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life .
11:2:024:0	Now therefore , as the Lord lives , who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father and who has made me a house as He promised , surely Adonijah shall be put to death today . ”
11:2:025:0	So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell upon him so that he died .
11:2:026:0	Then to Abiathar the priest the king said , “ Go to Anathoth to your own field , for you deserve to die ; but I will not put you to death at this time , because you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David , and because you were afflicted in everything with which my father was afflicted . ”
11:2:004:1	Joab Executed
11:2:027:0	So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to the Lord , in order to fulfill the word of the Lord , which He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
11:2:028:0	Now the news came to Joab , for Joab had followed Adonijah , although he had not followed Absalom . And Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar .
11:2:029:0	It was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord , and behold , he is beside the altar . Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , “ Go , fall upon him . ”
11:2:030:0	So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him , “ Thus the king has said , ‘Come out . ’ ” But he said , “ No , for I will die here . ” And Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , “ Thus spoke Joab , and thus he answered me . ”
11:2:031:0	The king said to him , “ Do as he has spoken and fall upon him and bury him , that you may remove from me and from my father’s house the blood which Joab shed without cause .
11:2:032:0	The Lord will return his blood on his own head , because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and killed them with the sword , while my father David did not know it : Abner the son of Ner , commander of the army of Israel , and Amasa the son of Jether , commander of the army of Judah .
11:2:033:0	So shall their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever ; but to David and his descendants and his house and his throne , may there be peace from the Lord forever . ”
11:2:034:0	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and put him to death , and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness .
11:2:005:1	Shimei Executed
11:2:035:0	The king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place , and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar .
11:2:036:0	Now the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him , “ Build for yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there , and do not go out from there to any place .
11:2:037:0	For on the day you go out and cross over the brook Kidron , you will know for certain that you shall surely die ; your blood shall be on your own head . ”
11:2:038:0	Shimei then said to the king , “ The word is good . As my lord the king has said , so your servant will do . ” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days .
11:2:039:0	But it came about at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maacah , king of Gath . And they told Shimei , saying , “ Behold , your servants are in Gath . ”
11:2:040:0	Then Shimei arose and saddled his donkey , and went to Gath to Achish to look for his servants . And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath .
11:2:041:0	It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and had returned .
11:2:042:0	So the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him , “ Did I not make you swear by the Lord and solemnly warn you , saying , ‘You will know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere , you shall surely die’ ? And you said to me , ‘The word which I have heard is good . ’
11:2:043:0	Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord , and the command which I have laid on you ? ”
11:2:044:0	The king also said to Shimei , “ You know all the evil which you acknowledge in your heart , which you did to my father David ; therefore the Lord shall return your evil on your own head .
11:2:045:0	But King Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever . ”
11:2:046:0	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and he went out and fell upon him so that he died . Thus the kingdom was established in the hands of Solomon .
