33:7:001:1	The Prophet Acknowledges
33:7:001:0	Woe is me ! For I amLike the fruit pickers , like the grape gatherers . There is not a cluster of grapes to eat , Or a first-ripe fig which I crave .
33:7:002:0	The godly person has perished from the land , And there is no upright person among men . All of them lie in wait for bloodshed ; Each of them hunts the other with a net .
33:7:003:0	Concerning evil , both hands do it well . The prince asks , also the judge , for a bribe , And a great man speaks the desire of his soul ; So they weave it together .
33:7:004:0	The best of them is like a briar , The most upright like a thorn hedge . The day when you post your watchmen , Your punishment will come . Then their confusion will occur .
33:7:005:0	Do not trust in a neighbor ; Do not have confidence in a friend . From her who lies in your bosomGuard your lips .
33:7:002:1	God Is the Source of Salvation and Light
33:7:006:0	For son treats father contemptuously , Daughter rises up against her mother , Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ; A man’s enemies are the men of his own household .
33:7:007:0	But as for me , I will watch expectantly for the Lord ; I will wait for the God of my salvation . My God will hear me .
33:7:008:0	Do not rejoice over me , O my enemy . Though I fall I will rise ; Though I dwell in darkness , the Lord is a light for me .
33:7:009:0	I will bear the indignation of the LordBecause I have sinned against Him , Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me . He will bring me out to the light , And I will see His righteousness .
33:7:010:0	Then my enemy will see , And shame will cover her who said to me , “ Where is the Lord your God ? ” My eyes will look on her ; At that time she will be trampled downLike mire of the streets .
33:7:011:0	It will be a day for building your walls . On that day will your boundary be extended .
33:7:012:0	It will be a day when they will come to youFrom Assyria and the cities of Egypt , From Egypt even to the Euphrates , Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain .
33:7:013:0	And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants , On account of the fruit of their deeds .
33:7:014:0	Shepherd Your people with Your scepter , The flock of Your possessionWhich dwells by itself in the woodland , In the midst of a fruitful field . Let them feed in Bashan and GileadAs in the days of old .
33:7:015:0	“ As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt , I will show you miracles . ”
33:7:016:0	Nations will see and be ashamedOf all their might . They will put their hand on their mouth , Their ears will be deaf .
33:7:017:0	They will lick the dust like a serpent , Like reptiles of the earth . They will come trembling out of their fortresses ; To the Lord our God they will come in dreadAnd they will be afraid before You .
33:7:018:0	Who is a God like You , who pardons iniquityAnd passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession ? He does not retain His anger forever , Because He delights in unchanging love .
33:7:019:0	He will again have compassion on us ; He will tread our iniquities under foot . Yes , You will cast all their sinsInto the depths of the sea .
33:7:020:0	You will give truth to Jacob And unchanging love to Abraham , Which You swore to our forefathersFrom the days of old .
