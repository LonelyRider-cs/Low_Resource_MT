33:4:001:1	Peaceful Latter Days
33:4:001:0	And it will come about in the last daysThat the mountain of the house of the LordWill be established as the chief of the mountains . It will be raised above the hills , And the peoples will stream to it .
33:4:002:0	Many nations will come and say , “ Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LordAnd to the house of the God of Jacob , That He may teach us about His waysAnd that we may walk in His paths . ” For from Zion will go forth the law , Even the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
33:4:003:0	And He will judge between many peoplesAnd render decisions for mighty , distant nations . Then they will hammer their swords into plowsharesAnd their spears into pruning hooks ; Nation will not lift up sword against nation , And never again will they train for war .
33:4:004:0	Each of them will sit under his vineAnd under his fig tree , With no one to make them afraid , For the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken .
33:4:005:0	Though all the peoples walkEach in the name of his god , As for us , we will walkIn the name of the Lord our God forever and ever .
33:4:006:0	“ In that day , ” declares the Lord , “ I will assemble the lameAnd gather the outcasts , Even those whom I have afflicted .
33:4:007:0	I will make the lame a remnantAnd the outcasts a strong nation , And the Lord will reign over them in Mount ZionFrom now on and forever .
33:4:008:0	As for you , tower of the flock , Hill of the daughter of Zion , To you it will come—Even the former dominion will come , The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem .
33:4:009:0	“ Now , why do you cry out loudly ? Is there no king among you , Or has your counselor perished , That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth ?
33:4:010:0	Writhe and labor to give birth , Daughter of Zion , Like a woman in childbirth ; For now you will go out of the city , Dwell in the field , And go to Babylon . There you will be rescued ; There the Lord will redeem youFrom the hand of your enemies .
33:4:011:0	And now many nations have been assembled against youWho say , ‘Let her be polluted , And let our eyes gloat over Zion . ’
33:4:012:0	But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord , And they do not understand His purpose ; For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor .
33:4:013:0	Arise and thresh , daughter of Zion , For your horn I will make ironAnd your hoofs I will make bronze , That you may pulverize many peoples , That you may devote to the Lord their unjust gainAnd their wealth to the Lord of all the earth .
