33:6:001:1	God’s Indictment of His People
33:6:001:0	Hear now what the Lord is saying , “ Arise , plead your case before the mountains , And let the hills hear your voice .
33:6:002:0	Listen , you mountains , to the indictment of the Lord , And you enduring foundations of the earth , Because the Lord has a case against His people ; Even with Israel He will dispute .
33:6:003:0	My people , what have I done to you , And how have I wearied you ? Answer Me .
33:6:004:0	Indeed , I brought you up from the land of EgyptAnd ransomed you from the house of slavery , And I sent before you Moses , Aaron and Miriam .
33:6:002:1	What God Requires of Man
33:6:005:0	My people , remember nowWhat Balak king of Moab counseledAnd what Balaam son of Beor answered him , And from Shittim to Gilgal , So that you might know the righteous acts of the Lord . ”
33:6:006:0	With what shall I come to the Lord And bow myself before the God on high ? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings , With yearling calves ?
33:6:007:0	Does the Lord take delight in thousands of rams , In ten thousand rivers of oil ? Shall I present my firstborn for my rebellious acts , The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
33:6:008:0	He has told you , O man , what is good ; And what does the Lord require of youBut to do justice , to love kindness , And to walk humbly with your God ?
33:6:009:0	The voice of the Lord will call to the city—And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name : “ Hear , O tribe . Who has appointed its time ?
33:6:010:0	Is there yet a man in the wicked house , Along with treasures of wickednessAnd a short measure that is cursed ?
33:6:011:0	Can I justify wicked scalesAnd a bag of deceptive weights ?
33:6:012:0	For the rich men of the city are full of violence , Her residents speak lies , And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
33:6:013:0	So also I will make you sick , striking you down , Desolating you because of your sins .
33:6:014:0	You will eat , but you will not be satisfied , And your vileness will be in your midst . You will try to remove for safekeeping , But you will not preserve anything , And what you do preserve I will give to the sword .
33:6:015:0	You will sow but you will not reap . You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil ; And the grapes , but you will not drink wine .
33:6:016:0	The statutes of OmriAnd all the works of the house of Ahab are observed ; And in their devices you walk . Therefore I will give you up for destructionAnd your inhabitants for derision , And you will bear the reproach of My people . ”
