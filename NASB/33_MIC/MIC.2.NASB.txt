33:2:001:1	Woe to Oppressors
33:2:001:0	Woe to those who scheme iniquity , Who work out evil on their beds ! When morning comes , they do it , For it is in the power of their hands .
33:2:002:0	They covet fields and then seize them , And houses , and take them away . They rob a man and his house , A man and his inheritance .
33:2:003:0	Therefore thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I am planning against this family a calamityFrom which you cannot remove your necks ; And you will not walk haughtily , For it will be an evil time .
33:2:004:0	On that day they will take up against you a tauntAnd utter a bitter lamentation and say , ‘We are completely destroyed ! He exchanges the portion of my people ; How He removes it from me ! To the apostate He apportions our fields . ’
33:2:005:0	Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring lineFor you by lot in the assembly of the Lord .
33:2:006:0	‘Do not speak out , ’ so they speak out . But if they do not speak out concerning these things , Reproaches will not be turned back .
33:2:007:0	Is it being said , O house of Jacob : ‘Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient ? Are these His doings ? ’Do not My words do goodTo the one walking uprightly ?
33:2:008:0	Recently My people have arisen as an enemy—You strip the robe off the garmentFrom unsuspecting passers-by , From those returned from war .
33:2:009:0	The women of My people you evict , Each one from her pleasant house . From her children you take My splendor forever .
33:2:010:0	Arise and go , For this is no place of restBecause of the uncleanness that brings on destruction , A painful destruction .
33:2:011:0	If a man walking after wind and falsehoodHad told lies and said , ‘I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor , ’He would be spokesman to this people .
33:2:012:0	“ I will surely assemble all of you , Jacob , I will surely gather the remnant of Israel . I will put them together like sheep in the fold ; Like a flock in the midst of its pastureThey will be noisy with men .
33:2:013:0	The breaker goes up before them ; They break out , pass through the gate and go out by it . So their king goes on before them , And the Lord at their head . ”
