33:1:001:1	Destruction in Israel and Judah
33:1:001:0	The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
33:1:002:0	Hear , O peoples , all of you ; Listen , O earth and all it contains , And let the Lord God be a witness against you , The Lord from His holy temple .
33:1:003:0	For behold , the Lord is coming forth from His place . He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth .
33:1:004:0	The mountains will melt under HimAnd the valleys will be split , Like wax before the fire , Like water poured down a steep place .
33:1:005:0	All this is for the rebellion of JacobAnd for the sins of the house of Israel . What is the rebellion of Jacob ? Is it not Samaria ? What is the high place of Judah ? Is it not Jerusalem ?
33:1:006:0	For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country , Planting places for a vineyard . I will pour her stones down into the valleyAnd will lay bare her foundations .
33:1:007:0	All of her idols will be smashed , All of her earnings will be burned with fireAnd all of her images I will make desolate , For she collected them from a harlot’s earnings , And to the earnings of a harlot they will return .
33:1:008:0	Because of this I must lament and wail , I must go barefoot and naked ; I must make a lament like the jackalsAnd a mourning like the ostriches .
33:1:009:0	For her wound is incurable , For it has come to Judah ; It has reached the gate of my people , Even to Jerusalem .
33:1:010:0	Tell it not in Gath , Weep not at all . At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust .
33:1:011:0	Go on your way , inhabitant of Shaphir , in shameful nakedness . The inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape . The lamentation of Beth-ezel : “ He will take from you its support . ”
33:1:012:0	For the inhabitant of MarothBecomes weak waiting for good , Because a calamity has come down from the LordTo the gate of Jerusalem .
33:1:013:0	Harness the chariot to the team of horses , O inhabitant of Lachish—She was the beginning of sinTo the daughter of Zion—Because in you were foundThe rebellious acts of Israel .
33:1:014:0	Therefore you will give parting giftsOn behalf of Moresheth-gath ; The houses of Achzib will become a deceptionTo the kings of Israel .
33:1:015:0	Moreover , I will bring on youThe one who takes possession , O inhabitant of Mareshah . The glory of Israel will enter Adullam .
33:1:016:0	Make yourself bald and cut off your hair , Because of the children of your delight ; Extend your baldness like the eagle , For they will go from you into exile .
