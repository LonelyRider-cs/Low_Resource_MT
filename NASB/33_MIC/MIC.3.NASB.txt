33:3:001:1	Rulers Denounced
33:3:001:0	And I said , “ Hear now , heads of JacobAnd rulers of the house of Israel . Is it not for you to know justice ?
33:3:002:0	You who hate good and love evil , Who tear off their skin from themAnd their flesh from their bones ,
33:3:003:0	Who eat the flesh of my people , Strip off their skin from them , Break their bonesAnd chop them up as for the potAnd as meat in a kettle . ”
33:3:004:0	Then they will cry out to the Lord , But He will not answer them . Instead , He will hide His face from them at that timeBecause they have practiced evil deeds .
33:3:005:0	Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray ; When they have something to bite with their teeth , They cry , “ Peace , ” But against him who puts nothing in their mouthsThey declare holy war .
33:3:006:0	Therefore it will be night for you—without vision , And darkness for you—without divination . The sun will go down on the prophets , And the day will become dark over them .
33:3:007:0	The seers will be ashamedAnd the diviners will be embarrassed . Indeed , they will all cover their mouthsBecause there is no answer from God .
33:3:008:0	On the other hand I am filled with power—With the Spirit of the Lord—And with justice and courageTo make known to Jacob his rebellious act , Even to Israel his sin .
33:3:009:0	Now hear this , heads of the house of JacobAnd rulers of the house of Israel , Who abhor justiceAnd twist everything that is straight ,
33:3:010:0	Who build Zion with bloodshedAnd Jerusalem with violent injustice .
33:3:011:0	Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe , Her priests instruct for a priceAnd her prophets divine for money . Yet they lean on the Lord saying , “ Is not the Lord in our midst ? Calamity will not come upon us . ”
33:3:012:0	Therefore , on account of youZion will be plowed as a field , Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins , And the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest .
