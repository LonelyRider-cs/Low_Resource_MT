33:5:001:1	Birth of the King in Bethlehem
33:5:001:0	“ Now muster yourselves in troops , daughter of troops ; They have laid siege against us ; With a rod they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek .
33:5:002:0	But as for you , Bethlehem Ephrathah , Too little to be among the clans of Judah , From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel . His goings forth are from long ago , From the days of eternity . ”
33:5:003:0	Therefore He will give them up until the timeWhen she who is in labor has borne a child . Then the remainder of His brethrenWill return to the sons of Israel .
33:5:004:0	And He will arise and shepherd His flockIn the strength of the Lord , In the majesty of the name of the Lord His God . And they will remain , Because at that time He will be greatTo the ends of the earth .
33:5:005:0	This One will be our peace . When the Assyrian invades our land , When he tramples on our citadels , Then we will raise against himSeven shepherds and eight leaders of men .
33:5:006:0	They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword , The land of Nimrod at its entrances ; And He will deliver us from the AssyrianWhen he attacks our landAnd when he tramples our territory .
33:5:007:0	Then the remnant of JacobWill be among many peoplesLike dew from the Lord , Like showers on vegetationWhich do not wait for manOr delay for the sons of men .
33:5:008:0	The remnant of JacobWill be among the nations , Among many peoplesLike a lion among the beasts of the forest , Like a young lion among flocks of sheep , Which , if he passes through , Tramples down and tears , And there is none to rescue .
33:5:009:0	Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries , And all your enemies will be cut off .
33:5:010:0	“ It will be in that day , ” declares the Lord , “ That I will cut off your horses from among youAnd destroy your chariots .
33:5:011:0	I will also cut off the cities of your landAnd tear down all your fortifications .
33:5:012:0	I will cut off sorceries from your hand , And you will have fortune-tellers no more .
33:5:013:0	I will cut off your carved imagesAnd your sacred pillars from among you , So that you will no longer bow downTo the work of your hands .
33:5:014:0	I will root out your Asherim from among youAnd destroy your cities .
33:5:015:0	And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrathOn the nations which have not obeyed . ”
