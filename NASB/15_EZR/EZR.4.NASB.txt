15:4:001:1	Adversaries Hinder the Work
15:4:001:0	Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the Lord God of Israel ,
15:4:002:0	they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers’ households , and said to them , “ Let us build with you , for we , like you , seek your God ; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria , who brought us up here . ”
15:4:003:0	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers’ households of Israel said to them , “ You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God ; but we ourselves will together build to the Lord God of Israel , as King Cyrus , the king of Persia has commanded us . ”
15:4:004:0	Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah , and frightened them from building ,
15:4:005:0	and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
15:4:006:0	Now in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
15:4:002:1	The Letter to King Artaxerxes
15:4:007:0	And in the days of Artaxerxes , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic .
15:4:008:0	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes , as follows—
15:4:009:0	then wrote Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues , the judges and the lesser governors , the officials , the secretaries , the men of Erech , the Babylonians , the men of Susa , that is , the Elamites ,
15:4:010:0	and the rest of the nations which the great and honorable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria , and in the rest of the region beyond the River . Now
15:4:011:0	this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him : “ To King Artaxerxes : Your servants , the men in the region beyond the River , and now
15:4:012:0	let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem ; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations .
15:4:013:0	Now let it be known to the king , that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished , they will not pay tribute , custom or toll , and it will damage the revenue of the kings .
15:4:014:0	Now because we are in the service of the palace , and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonor , therefore we have sent and informed the king ,
15:4:015:0	so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers . And you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces , and that they have incited revolt within it in past days ; therefore that city was laid waste .
15:4:003:1	The King Replies and Work Stops
15:4:016:0	We inform the king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished , as a result you will have no possession in the province beyond the River . ”
15:4:017:0	Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the commander , to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and in the rest of the provinces beyond the River : “ Peace . And now
15:4:018:0	the document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me .
15:4:019:0	A decree has been issued by me , and a search has been made and it has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days , that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it ,
15:4:020:0	that mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem , governing all the provinces beyond the River , and that tribute , custom and toll were paid to them .
15:4:021:0	So , now issue a decree to make these men stop work , that this city may not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me .
15:4:022:0	Beware of being negligent in carrying out this matter ; why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings ? ”
15:4:023:0	Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes’ document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues , they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms .
15:4:024:0	Then work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased , and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
