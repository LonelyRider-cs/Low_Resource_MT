15:3:001:1	Altar and Sacrifices Restored
15:3:001:0	Now when the seventh month came , and the sons of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem .
15:3:002:0	Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests , and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it , as it is written in the law of Moses , the man of God .
15:3:003:0	So they set up the altar on its foundation , for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord , burnt offerings morning and evening .
15:3:004:0	They celebrated the Feast of Booths , as it is written , and offered the fixed number of burnt offerings daily , according to the ordinance , as each day required ;
15:3:005:0	and afterward there was a continual burnt offering , also for the new moons and for all the fixed festivals of the Lord that were consecrated , and from everyone who offered a freewill offering to the Lord .
15:3:006:0	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord , but the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not been laid .
15:3:002:1	Temple Restoration Begun
15:3:007:0	Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters , and food , drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians , to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa , according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia .
15:3:008:0	Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month , Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites , and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem , began the work and appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to oversee the work of the house of the Lord .
15:3:009:0	Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers stood united with Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah and the sons of Henadad with their sons and brothers the Levites , to oversee the workmen in the temple of God .
15:3:010:0	Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord , the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets , and the Levites , the sons of Asaph , with cymbals , to praise the Lord according to the directions of King David of Israel .
15:3:011:0	They sang , praising and giving thanks to the Lord , saying , “ For He is good , for His lovingkindness is upon Israel forever . ” And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid .
15:3:012:0	Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households , the old men who had seen the first temple , wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , while many shouted aloud for joy ,
15:3:013:0	so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people , for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the sound was heard far away .
