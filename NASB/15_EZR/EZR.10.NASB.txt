15:10:001:1	Reconciliation with God
15:10:001:0	Now while Ezra was praying and making confession , weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God , a very large assembly , men , women and children , gathered to him from Israel ; for the people wept bitterly .
15:10:002:0	Shecaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , said to Ezra , “ We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land ; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this .
15:10:003:0	So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children , according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God ; and let it be done according to the law .
15:10:004:0	Arise ! For this matter is your responsibility , but we will be with you ; be courageous and act . ”
15:10:005:0	Then Ezra rose and made the leading priests , the Levites and all Israel , take oath that they would do according to this proposal ; so they took the oath .
15:10:006:0	Then Ezra rose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib . Although he went there , he did not eat bread nor drink water , for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles .
15:10:007:0	They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles , that they should assemble at Jerusalem ,
15:10:008:0	and that whoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders , all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles .
15:10:009:0	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days . It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month , and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God , trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain .
15:10:010:0	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , “ You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel .
15:10:011:0	Now therefore , make confession to the Lord God of your fathers and do His will ; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives . ”
15:10:012:0	Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice , “ That’s right ! As you have said , so it is our duty to do .
15:10:013:0	But there are many people ; it is the rainy season and we are not able to stand in the open . Nor can the task be done in one or two days , for we have transgressed greatly in this matter .
15:10:014:0	Let our leaders represent the whole assembly and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times , together with the elders and judges of each city , until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us . ”
15:10:015:0	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this , with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them .
15:10:016:0	But the exiles did so . And Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers’ households for each of their father’s households , all of them by name . So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter .
