15:7:001:0	Now after these things , in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia , there went up Ezra son of Seraiah , son of Azariah , son of Hilkiah ,

15:7:006:0	This Ezra went up from Babylon , and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses , which the Lord God of Israel had given ; and the king granted him all he requested because the hand of the Lord his God was upon him .
15:7:007:0	Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests , the Levites , the singers , the gatekeepers and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes .
15:7:008:0	He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
15:7:009:0	For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon ; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem , because the good hand of his God was upon him .
15:7:002:1	King’s Decree on Behalf of Ezra
15:7:010:0	For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the Lord and to practice it , and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel .
15:7:011:0	Now this is the copy of the decree which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest , the scribe , learned in the words of the commandments of the Lord and His statutes to Israel :
15:7:012:0	“ Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect peace . And now
15:7:013:0	I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem , may go with you .
15:7:014:0	Forasmuch as you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
15:7:015:0	and to bring the silver and gold , which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose dwelling is in Jerusalem ,
15:7:016:0	with all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon , along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests , who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ;
15:7:017:0	with this money , therefore , you shall diligently buy bulls , rams and lambs , with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
15:7:018:0	Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold , you may do according to the will of your God .
15:7:019:0	Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem .
15:7:020:0	The rest of the needs for the house of your God , for which you may have occasion to provide , provide for it from the royal treasury .
15:7:021:0	“ I , even I , King Artaxerxes , issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the provinces beyond the River , that whatever Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , may require of you , it shall be done diligently ,
15:7:022:0	even up to 100 talents of silver , 100 kors of wheat , 100 baths of wine , 100 baths of oil , and salt as needed .
15:7:023:0	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven , so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons .
15:7:024:0	We also inform you that it is not allowed to impose tax , tribute or toll on any of the priests , Levites , singers , doorkeepers , Nethinim or servants of this house of God .
15:7:025:0	“ You , Ezra , according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand , appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in the province beyond the River , even all those who know the laws of your God ; and you may teach anyone who is ignorant of them .
15:7:003:1	The King’s Kindness
15:7:026:0	Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king , let judgment be executed upon him strictly , whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment . ”
15:7:027:0	Blessed be the Lord , the God of our fathers , who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart , to adorn the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem ,
15:7:028:0	and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king’s mighty princes . Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of the Lord my God upon me , and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me .
