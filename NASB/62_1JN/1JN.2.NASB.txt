62:2:001:1	Christ Is Our Advocate
62:2:001:0	My little children , I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin . And if anyone sins , we have an Advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous ;
62:2:002:0	and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins ; and not for ours only , but also for those of the whole world .
62:2:003:0	By this we know that we have come to know Him , if we keep His commandments .
62:2:004:0	The one who says , “ I have come to know Him , ” and does not keep His commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him ;
62:2:005:0	but whoever keeps His word , in him the love of God has truly been perfected . By this we know that we are in Him :
62:2:006:0	the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked .
62:2:007:0	Beloved , I am not writing a new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning ; the old commandment is the word which you have heard .
62:2:008:0	On the other hand , I am writing a new commandment to you , which is true in Him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining .
62:2:009:0	The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now .
62:2:010:0	The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him .
62:2:011:0	But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62:2:012:0	I am writing to you , little children , because your sins have been forgiven you for His name’s sake .
62:2:013:0	I am writing to you , fathers , because you know Him who has been from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I have written to you , children , because you know the Father .
62:2:002:1	Do Not Love the World
62:2:014:0	I have written to you , fathers , because you know Him who has been from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God abides in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
62:2:015:0	Do not love the world nor the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62:2:016:0	For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life , is not from the Father , but is from the world .
62:2:017:0	The world is passing away , and also its lusts ; but the one who does the will of God lives forever .
62:2:018:0	Children , it is the last hour ; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have appeared ; from this we know that it is the last hour .
62:2:019:0	They went out from us , but they were not really of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us ; but they went out , so that it would be shown that they all are not of us .
62:2:020:0	But you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all know .
62:2:021:0	I have not written to you because you do not know the truth , but because you do know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
62:2:022:0	Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the antichrist , the one who denies the Father and the Son .
62:2:023:0	Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father ; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also .
62:2:003:1	The Promise Is Eternal Life
62:2:024:0	As for you , let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning . If what you heard from the beginning abides in you , you also will abide in the Son and in the Father .
62:2:025:0	This is the promise which He Himself made to us : eternal life .
62:2:026:0	These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you .
62:2:027:0	As for you , the anointing which you received from Him abides in you , and you have no need for anyone to teach you ; but as His anointing teaches you about all things , and is true and is not a lie , and just as it has taught you , you abide in Him .
62:2:028:0	Now , little children , abide in Him , so that when He appears , we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming .
62:2:029:0	If you know that He is righteous , you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him .
