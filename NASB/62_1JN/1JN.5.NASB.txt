62:5:001:1	Overcoming the World
62:5:001:0	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God , and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him .
62:5:002:0	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and observe His commandments .
62:5:003:0	For this is the love of God , that we keep His commandments ; and His commandments are not burdensome .
62:5:004:0	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world ; and this is the victory that has overcome the worldâ€”our faith .
62:5:005:0	Who is the one who overcomes the world , but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62:5:006:0	This is the One who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and with the blood . It is the Spirit who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
62:5:007:0	For there are three that testify :
62:5:008:0	the Spirit and the water and the blood ; and the three are in agreement .
62:5:009:0	If we receive the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater ; for the testimony of God is this , that He has testified concerning His Son .
62:5:010:0	The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself ; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son .
62:5:011:0	And the testimony is this , that God has given us eternal life , and this life is in His Son .
62:5:002:1	This Is Written That You May Know
62:5:012:0	He who has the Son has the life ; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life .
62:5:013:0	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , so that you may know that you have eternal life .
62:5:014:0	This is the confidence which we have before Him , that , if we ask anything according to His will , He hears us .
62:5:015:0	And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask , we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him .
62:5:016:0	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death , he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death . There is a sin leading to death ; I do not say that he should make request for this .
62:5:017:0	All unrighteousness is sin , and there is a sin not leading to death .
62:5:018:0	We know that no one who is born of God sins ; but He who was born of God keeps him , and the evil one does not touch him .
62:5:019:0	We know that we are of God , and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
62:5:020:0	And we know that the Son of God has come , and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true ; and we are in Him who is true , in His Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God and eternal life .
62:5:021:0	Little children , guard yourselves from idols .
