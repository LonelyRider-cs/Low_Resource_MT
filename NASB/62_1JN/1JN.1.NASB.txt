62:1:001:1	Introduction , The Incarnate Word
62:1:001:0	What was from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we have looked at and touched with our hands , concerning the Word of Life—
62:1:002:0	and the life was manifested , and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life , which was with the Father and was manifested to us—
62:1:003:0	what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also , so that you too may have fellowship with us ; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father , and with His Son Jesus Christ .
62:1:002:1	God Is Light
62:1:004:0	These things we write , so that our joy may be made complete .
62:1:005:0	This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you , that God is Light , and in Him there is no darkness at all .
62:1:006:0	If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness , we lie and do not practice the truth ;
62:1:007:0	but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin .
62:1:008:0	If we say that we have no sin , we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62:1:009:0	If we confess our sins , He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
62:1:010:0	If we say that we have not sinned , we make Him a liar and His word is not in us .
