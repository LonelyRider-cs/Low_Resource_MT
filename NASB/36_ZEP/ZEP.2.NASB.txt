36:2:001:1	Judgments on Judah’s Enemies
36:2:001:0	Gather yourselves together , yes , gather , O nation without shame ,
36:2:002:0	Before the decree takes effect—The day passes like the chaff—Before the burning anger of the Lord comes upon you , Before the day of the Lord’s anger comes upon you .
36:2:003:0	Seek the Lord , All you humble of the earthWho have carried out His ordinances ; Seek righteousness , seek humility . Perhaps you will be hiddenIn the day of the Lord’s anger .
36:2:004:0	For Gaza will be abandonedAnd Ashkelon a desolation ; Ashdod will be driven out at noonAnd Ekron will be uprooted .
36:2:005:0	Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast , The nation of the Cherethites ! The word of the Lord is against you , O Canaan , land of the Philistines ; And I will destroy youSo that there will be no inhabitant .
36:2:006:0	So the seacoast will be pastures , With caves for shepherds and folds for flocks .
36:2:007:0	And the coast will beFor the remnant of the house of Judah , They will pasture on it . In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening ; For the Lord their God will care for themAnd restore their fortune .
36:2:008:0	“ I have heard the taunting of MoabAnd the revilings of the sons of Ammon , With which they have taunted My peopleAnd become arrogant against their territory .
36:2:009:0	Therefore , as I live , ” declares the Lord of hosts , The God of Israel , “ Surely Moab will be like SodomAnd the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah—A place possessed by nettles and salt pits , And a perpetual desolation . The remnant of My people will plunder themAnd the remainder of My nation will inherit them . ”
36:2:010:0	This they will have in return for their pride , because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the Lord of hosts .
36:2:011:0	The Lord will be terrifying to them , for He will starve all the gods of the earth ; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him , everyone from his own place .
36:2:012:0	“ You also , O Ethiopians , will be slain by My sword . ”
36:2:013:0	And He will stretch out His hand against the northAnd destroy Assyria , And He will make Nineveh a desolation , Parched like the wilderness .
36:2:014:0	Flocks will lie down in her midst , All beasts which range in herds ; Both the pelican and the hedgehogWill lodge in the tops of her pillars ; Birds will sing in the window , Desolation will be on the threshold ; For He has laid bare the cedar work .
36:2:015:0	This is the exultant cityWhich dwells securely , Who says in her heart , “ I am , and there is no one besides me . ” How she has become a desolation , A resting place for beasts ! Everyone who passes by her will hiss And wave his hand in contempt .
