36:1:001:1	Day of Judgment on Judah
36:1:001:0	The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi , son of Gedaliah , son of Amariah , son of Hezekiah , in the days of Josiah son of Amon , king of Judah :
36:1:002:0	“ I will completely remove all thingsFrom the face of the earth , ” declares the Lord .
36:1:003:0	“ I will remove man and beast ; I will remove the birds of the skyAnd the fish of the sea , And the ruins along with the wicked ; And I will cut off man from the face of the earth , ” declares the Lord .
36:1:004:0	“ So I will stretch out My hand against JudahAnd against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem . And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place , And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests .
36:1:005:0	And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven , And those who bow down and swear to the Lord and yet swear by Milcom ,
36:1:006:0	And those who have turned back from following the Lord , And those who have not sought the Lord or inquired of Him . ”
36:1:007:0	Be silent before the Lord God ! For the day of the Lord is near , For the Lord has prepared a sacrifice , He has consecrated His guests .
36:1:008:0	“ Then it will come about on the day of the Lord’s sacrificeThat I will punish the princes , the king’s sonsAnd all who clothe themselves with foreign garments .
36:1:009:0	And I will punish on that day all who leap on the temple threshold , Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit .
36:1:010:0	On that day , ” declares the Lord , “ There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate , A wail from the Second Quarter , And a loud crash from the hills .
36:1:011:0	Wail , O inhabitants of the Mortar , For all the people of Canaan will be silenced ; All who weigh out silver will be cut off .
36:1:012:0	It will come about at that timeThat I will search Jerusalem with lamps , And I will punish the menWho are stagnant in spirit , Who say in their hearts , ‘The Lord will not do good or evil ! ’
36:1:013:0	Moreover , their wealth will become plunderAnd their houses desolate ; Yes , they will build houses but not inhabit them , And plant vineyards but not drink their wine . ”
36:1:014:0	Near is the great day of the Lord , Near and coming very quickly ; Listen , the day of the Lord ! In it the warrior cries out bitterly .
36:1:015:0	A day of wrath is that day , A day of trouble and distress , A day of destruction and desolation , A day of darkness and gloom , A day of clouds and thick darkness ,
36:1:016:0	A day of trumpet and battle cryAgainst the fortified citiesAnd the high corner towers .
36:1:017:0	I will bring distress on menSo that they will walk like the blind , Because they have sinned against the Lord ; And their blood will be poured out like dustAnd their flesh like dung .
36:1:018:0	Neither their silver nor their goldWill be able to deliver themOn the day of the Lord’s wrath ; And all the earth will be devouredIn the fire of His jealousy , For He will make a complete end , Indeed a terrifying one , Of all the inhabitants of the earth .
