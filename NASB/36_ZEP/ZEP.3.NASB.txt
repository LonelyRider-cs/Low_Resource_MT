36:3:001:1	Woe to Jerusalem and the Nations
36:3:001:0	Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled , The tyrannical city !
36:3:002:0	She heeded no voice , She accepted no instruction . She did not trust in the Lord , She did not draw near to her God .
36:3:003:0	Her princes within her are roaring lions , Her judges are wolves at evening ; They leave nothing for the morning .
36:3:004:0	Her prophets are reckless , treacherous men ; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary . They have done violence to the law .
36:3:005:0	The Lord is righteous within her ; He will do no injustice . Every morning He brings His justice to light ; He does not fail . But the unjust knows no shame .
36:3:006:0	“ I have cut off nations ; Their corner towers are in ruins . I have made their streets desolate , With no one passing by ; Their cities are laid waste , Without a man , without an inhabitant .
36:3:007:0	I said , ‘Surely you will revere Me , Accept instruction . ’So her dwelling will not be cut off According to all that I have appointed concerning her . But they were eager to corrupt all their deeds .
36:3:008:0	“ Therefore wait for Me , ” declares the Lord , “ For the day when I rise up as a witness . Indeed , My decision is to gather nations , To assemble kingdoms , To pour out on them My indignation , All My burning anger ; For all the earth will be devouredBy the fire of My zeal .
36:3:009:0	For then I will give to the peoples purified lips , That all of them may call on the name of the Lord , To serve Him shoulder to shoulder .
36:3:010:0	From beyond the rivers of EthiopiaMy worshipers , My dispersed ones , Will bring My offerings .
36:3:002:1	A Remnant of Israel
36:3:011:0	In that day you will feel no shameBecause of all your deedsBy which you have rebelled against Me ; For then I will remove from your midstYour proud , exulting ones , And you will never again be haughtyOn My holy mountain .
36:3:012:0	But I will leave among youA humble and lowly people , And they will take refuge in the name of the Lord .
36:3:013:0	The remnant of Israel will do no wrongAnd tell no lies , Nor will a deceitful tongueBe found in their mouths ; For they will feed and lie downWith no one to make them tremble . ”
36:3:014:0	Shout for joy , O daughter of Zion ! Shout in triumph , O Israel ! Rejoice and exult with all your heart , O daughter of Jerusalem !
36:3:015:0	The Lord has taken away His judgments against you , He has cleared away your enemies . The King of Israel , the Lord , is in your midst ; You will fear disaster no more .
36:3:016:0	In that day it will be said to Jerusalem : “ Do not be afraid , O Zion ; Do not let your hands fall limp .
36:3:017:0	The Lord your God is in your midst , A victorious warrior . He will exult over you with joy , He will be quiet in His love , He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy .
36:3:018:0	I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts—They came from you , O Zion ; The reproach of exile is a burden on them .
36:3:019:0	Behold , I am going to deal at that timeWith all your oppressors , I will save the lameAnd gather the outcast , And I will turn their shame into praise and renownIn all the earth .
36:3:020:0	At that time I will bring you in , Even at the time when I gather you together ; Indeed , I will give you renown and praiseAmong all the peoples of the earth , When I restore your fortunes before your eyes , ” Says the Lord .
