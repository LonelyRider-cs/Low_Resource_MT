49:4:001:1	Unity of the Spirit
49:4:001:0	Therefore I , the prisoner of the Lord , implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called ,
49:4:002:0	with all humility and gentleness , with patience , showing tolerance for one another in love ,
49:4:003:0	being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49:4:004:0	There is one body and one Spirit , just as also you were called in one hope of your calling ;
49:4:005:0	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49:4:006:0	one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all .
49:4:007:0	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift .
49:4:008:0	Therefore it says , “ When He ascended on high , He led captive a host of captives , And He gave gifts to men . ”
49:4:009:0	( Now this expression , “ He ascended , ” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
49:4:010:0	He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens , so that He might fill all things . )
49:4:011:0	And He gave some as apostles , and some as prophets , and some as evangelists , and some as pastors and teachers ,
49:4:012:0	for the equipping of the saints for the work of service , to the building up of the body of Christ ;
49:4:013:0	until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a mature man , to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ .
49:4:014:0	As a result , we are no longer to be children , tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , by craftiness in deceitful scheming ;
49:4:015:0	but speaking the truth in love , we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head , even Christ ,
49:4:002:1	The Christian’s Walk
49:4:016:0	from whom the whole body , being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies , according to the proper working of each individual part , causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love .
49:4:017:0	So this I say , and affirm together with the Lord , that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk , in the futility of their mind ,
49:4:018:0	being darkened in their understanding , excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardness of their heart ;
49:4:019:0	and they , having become callous , have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness .
49:4:020:0	But you did not learn Christ in this way ,
49:4:021:0	if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him , just as truth is in Jesus ,
49:4:022:0	that , in reference to your former manner of life , you lay aside the old self , which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit ,
49:4:023:0	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
49:4:024:0	and put on the new self , which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth .
49:4:025:0	Therefore , laying aside falsehood , speak truth each one of you with his neighbor , for we are members of one another .
49:4:026:0	Be angry , and yet do not sin ; do not let the sun go down on your anger ,
49:4:027:0	and do not give the devil an opportunity .
49:4:028:0	He who steals must steal no longer ; but rather he must labor , performing with his own hands what is good , so that he will have something to share with one who has need .
49:4:029:0	Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth , but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment , so that it will give grace to those who hear .
49:4:030:0	Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49:4:031:0	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you , along with all malice .
49:4:032:0	Be kind to one another , tender-hearted , forgiving each other , just as God in Christ also has forgiven you .
