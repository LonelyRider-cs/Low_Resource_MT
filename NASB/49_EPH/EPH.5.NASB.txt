49:5:001:1	Be Imitators of God
49:5:001:0	Therefore be imitators of God , as beloved children ;
49:5:002:0	and walk in love , just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma .
49:5:003:0	But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you , as is proper among saints ;
49:5:004:0	and there must be no filthiness and silly talk , or coarse jesting , which are not fitting , but rather giving of thanks .
49:5:005:0	For this you know with certainty , that no immoral or impure person or covetous man , who is an idolater , has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
49:5:006:0	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
49:5:007:0	Therefore do not be partakers with them ;
49:5:008:0	for you were formerly darkness , but now you are Light in the Lord ; walk as children of Light
49:5:009:0	( for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
49:5:010:0	trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord .
49:5:011:0	Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness , but instead even expose them ;
49:5:012:0	for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret .
49:5:013:0	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light , for everything that becomes visible is light .
49:5:014:0	For this reason it says , “ Awake , sleeper , And arise from the dead , And Christ will shine on you . ”
49:5:015:0	Therefore be careful how you walk , not as unwise men but as wise ,
49:5:016:0	making the most of your time , because the days are evil .
49:5:017:0	So then do not be foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
49:5:018:0	And do not get drunk with wine , for that is dissipation , but be filled with the Spirit ,
49:5:019:0	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord ;
49:5:020:0	always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God , even the Father ;
49:5:002:1	Marriage Like Christ and the Church
49:5:021:0	and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ .
49:5:022:0	Wives , be subject to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
49:5:023:0	For the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ also is the head of the church , He Himself being the Savior of the body .
49:5:024:0	But as the church is subject to Christ , so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything .
49:5:025:0	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her ,
49:5:026:0	so that He might sanctify her , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word ,
49:5:027:0	that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory , having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but that she would be holy and blameless .
49:5:028:0	So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself ;
49:5:029:0	for no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ also does the church ,
49:5:030:0	because we are members of His body .
49:5:031:0	For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh .
49:5:032:0	This mystery is great ; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church .
49:5:033:0	Nevertheless , each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself , and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband .
