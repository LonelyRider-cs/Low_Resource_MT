49:3:001:1	Paul’s Stewardship
49:3:001:0	For this reason I , Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—
49:3:002:0	if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you ;
49:3:003:0	that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery , as I wrote before in brief .
49:3:004:0	By referring to this , when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
49:3:005:0	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men , as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
49:3:006:0	to be specific , that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel ,
49:3:007:0	of which I was made a minister , according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power .
49:3:008:0	To me , the very least of all saints , this grace was given , to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ ,
49:3:009:0	and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things ;
49:3:010:0	so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places .
49:3:011:0	This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
49:3:012:0	in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him .
49:3:013:0	Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf , for they are your glory .
49:3:014:0	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father ,
49:3:015:0	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name ,
49:3:016:0	that He would grant you , according to the riches of His glory , to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man ,
49:3:017:0	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ; and that you , being rooted and grounded in love ,
49:3:018:0	may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
49:3:019:0	and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge , that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God .
49:3:020:0	Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think , according to the power that works within us ,
49:3:021:0	to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever . Amen .
