49:2:001:1	Made Alive in Christ
49:2:001:0	And you were dead in your trespasses and sins ,
49:2:002:0	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience .
49:2:003:0	Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh , indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , even as the rest .
49:2:004:0	But God , being rich in mercy , because of His great love with which He loved us ,
49:2:005:0	even when we were dead in our transgressions , made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved ) ,
49:2:006:0	and raised us up with Him , and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
49:2:007:0	so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .
49:2:008:0	For by grace you have been saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves , it is the gift of God ;
49:2:009:0	not as a result of works , so that no one may boast .
49:2:010:0	For we are His workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them .
49:2:011:0	Therefore remember that formerly you , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are called “ Uncircumcision ” by the so-called “ Circumcision , ” which is performed in the flesh by human hands—
49:2:012:0	remember that you were at that time separate from Christ , excluded from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
49:2:013:0	But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49:2:014:0	For He Himself is our peace , who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall ,
49:2:015:0	by abolishing in His flesh the enmity , which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances , so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man , thus establishing peace ,
49:2:016:0	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross , by it having put to death the enmity .
49:2:017:0	And He came and preached peace to you who were far away , and peace to those who were near ;
49:2:018:0	for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father .
49:2:019:0	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens , but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and are of God’s household ,
49:2:020:0	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone ,
49:2:021:0	in whom the whole building , being fitted together , is growing into a holy temple in the Lord ,
49:2:022:0	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit .
