49:1:001:1	The Blessings of Redemption
49:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , To the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus :
49:1:002:0	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49:1:003:0	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ,
49:1:004:0	just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and blameless before Him . In love
49:1:005:0	He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself , according to the kind intention of His will ,
49:1:006:0	to the praise of the glory of His grace , which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved .
49:1:007:0	In Him we have redemption through His blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of His grace
49:1:008:0	which He lavished on us . In all wisdom and insight
49:1:009:0	He made known to us the mystery of His will , according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him
49:1:010:0	with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times , that is , the summing up of all things in Christ , things in the heavens and things on the earth . In Him
49:1:011:0	also we have obtained an inheritance , having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will ,
49:1:012:0	to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory .
49:1:013:0	In Him , you also , after listening to the message of truth , the gospel of your salvation—having also believed , you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise ,
49:1:014:0	who is given as a pledge of our inheritance , with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession , to the praise of His glory .
49:1:015:0	For this reason I too , having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints ,
49:1:016:0	do not cease giving thanks for you , while making mention of you in my prayers ;
49:1:017:0	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him .
49:1:018:0	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened , so that you will know what is the hope of His calling , what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints ,
49:1:019:0	and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe . These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might
49:1:020:0	which He brought about in Christ , when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places ,
49:1:021:0	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this age but also in the one to come .
49:1:022:0	And He put all things in subjection under His feet , and gave Him as head over all things to the church ,
49:1:023:0	which is His body , the fullness of Him who fills all in all .
