21:1:001:1	The Futility of All Endeavor
21:1:001:0	The words of the Preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem .
21:1:002:0	“ Vanity of vanities , ” says the Preacher , “ Vanity of vanities ! All is vanity . ”
21:1:003:0	What advantage does man have in all his workWhich he does under the sun ?
21:1:004:0	A generation goes and a generation comes , But the earth remains forever .
21:1:005:0	Also , the sun rises and the sun sets ; And hastening to its place it rises there again .
21:1:006:0	Blowing toward the south , Then turning toward the north , The wind continues swirling along ; And on its circular courses the wind returns .
21:1:007:0	All the rivers flow into the sea , Yet the sea is not full . To the place where the rivers flow , There they flow again .
21:1:008:0	All things are wearisome ; Man is not able to tell it . The eye is not satisfied with seeing , Nor is the ear filled with hearing .
21:1:009:0	That which has been is that which will be , And that which has been done is that which will be done . So there is nothing new under the sun .
21:1:010:0	Is there anything of which one might say , “ See this , it is new ” ? Already it has existed for agesWhich were before us .
21:1:002:1	The Futility of Wisdom
21:1:011:0	There is no remembrance of earlier things ; And also of the later things which will occur , There will be for them no remembranceAmong those who will come later still .
21:1:012:0	I , the Preacher , have been king over Israel in Jerusalem .
21:1:013:0	And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven . It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
21:1:014:0	I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun , and behold , all is vanity and striving after wind .
21:1:015:0	What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted .
21:1:016:0	I said to myself , “ Behold , I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me ; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge . ”
21:1:017:0	And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly ; I realized that this also is striving after wind .
21:1:018:0	Because in much wisdom there is much grief , and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain .
