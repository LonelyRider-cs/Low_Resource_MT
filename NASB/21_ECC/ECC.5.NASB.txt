21:5:001:1	Your Attitude Toward God
21:5:001:0	Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools ; for they do not know they are doing evil .
21:5:002:0	Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God . For God is in heaven and you are on the earth ; therefore let your words be few .
21:5:003:0	For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words .
21:5:004:0	When you make a vow to God , do not be late in paying it ; for He takes no delight in fools . Pay what you vow !
21:5:005:0	It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay .
21:5:006:0	Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake . Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands ?
21:5:007:0	For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness . Rather , fear God .
21:5:008:0	If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province , do not be shocked at the sight ; for one official watches over another official , and there are higher officials over them .
21:5:002:1	The Folly of Riches
21:5:009:0	After all , a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land .
21:5:010:0	He who loves money will not be satisfied with money , nor he who loves abundance with its income . This too is vanity .
21:5:011:0	When good things increase , those who consume them increase . So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on ?
21:5:012:0	The sleep of the working man is pleasant , whether he eats little or much ; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep .
21:5:013:0	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun : riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt .
21:5:014:0	When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son , then there was nothing to support him .
21:5:015:0	As he had come naked from his mother’s womb , so will he return as he came . He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand .
21:5:016:0	This also is a grievous evil—exactly as a man is born , thus will he die . So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind ?
21:5:017:0	Throughout his life he also eats in darkness with great vexation , sickness and anger .
21:5:018:0	Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting : to eat , to drink and enjoy oneself in all one’s labor in which he toils under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him ; for this is his reward .
21:5:019:0	Furthermore , as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth , He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor ; this is the gift of God .
21:5:020:0	For he will not often consider the years of his life , because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart .
