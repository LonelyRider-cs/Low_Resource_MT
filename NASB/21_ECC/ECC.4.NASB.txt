21:4:001:1	The Evils of Oppression
21:4:001:0	Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun . And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them ; and on the side of their oppressors was power , but they had no one to comfort them .
21:4:002:0	So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living .
21:4:003:0	But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed , who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun .
21:4:004:0	I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor . This too is vanity and striving after wind .
21:4:005:0	The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh .
21:4:006:0	One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind .
21:4:007:0	Then I looked again at vanity under the sun .
21:4:008:0	There was a certain man without a dependent , having neither a son nor a brother , yet there was no end to all his labor . Indeed , his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked , “ And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure ? ” This too is vanity and it is a grievous task .
21:4:009:0	Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor .
21:4:010:0	For if either of them falls , the one will lift up his companion . But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up .
21:4:011:0	Furthermore , if two lie down together they keep warm , but how can one be warm alone ?
21:4:012:0	And if one can overpower him who is alone , two can resist him . A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart .
21:4:013:0	A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive instruction .
21:4:014:0	For he has come out of prison to become king , even though he was born poor in his kingdom .
21:4:015:0	I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him .
21:4:016:0	There is no end to all the people , to all who were before them , and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him , for this too is vanity and striving after wind .
