21:10:001:1	A Little Foolishness
21:10:001:0	Dead flies make a perfumer’s oil stink , so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor .
21:10:002:0	A wise man’s heart directs him toward the right , but the foolish man’s heart directs him toward the left .
21:10:003:0	Even when the fool walks along the road , his sense is lacking and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool .
21:10:004:0	If the ruler’s temper rises against you , do not abandon your position , because composure allays great offenses .
21:10:005:0	There is an evil I have seen under the sun , like an error which goes forth from the ruler—
21:10:006:0	folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places .
21:10:007:0	I have seen slaves riding on horses and princes walking like slaves on the land .
21:10:008:0	He who digs a pit may fall into it , and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall .
21:10:009:0	He who quarries stones may be hurt by them , and he who splits logs may be endangered by them .
21:10:010:0	If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge , then he must exert more strength . Wisdom has the advantage of giving success .
21:10:011:0	If the serpent bites before being charmed , there is no profit for the charmer .
21:10:012:0	Words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious , while the lips of a fool consume him ;
21:10:013:0	the beginning of his talking is folly and the end of it is wicked madness .
21:10:014:0	Yet the fool multiplies words . No man knows what will happen , and who can tell him what will come after him ?
21:10:015:0	The toil of a fool so wearies him that he does not even know how to go to a city .
21:10:016:0	Woe to you , O land , whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning .
21:10:017:0	Blessed are you , O land , whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time—for strength and not for drunkenness .
21:10:018:0	Through indolence the rafters sag , and through slackness the house leaks .
21:10:019:0	Men prepare a meal for enjoyment , and wine makes life merry , and money is the answer to everything .
21:10:020:0	Furthermore , in your bedchamber do not curse a king , and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich man , for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound and the winged creature will make the matter known .
