21:2:001:1	The Futility of Pleasure and Possessions
21:2:001:0	I said to myself , “ Come now , I will test you with pleasure . So enjoy yourself . ” And behold , it too was futility .
21:2:002:0	I said of laughter , “ It is madness , ” and of pleasure , “ What does it accomplish ? ”
21:2:003:0	I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely , and how to take hold of folly , until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives .
21:2:004:0	I enlarged my works : I built houses for myself , I planted vineyards for myself ;
21:2:005:0	I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees ;
21:2:006:0	I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees .
21:2:007:0	I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves . Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem .
21:2:008:0	Also , I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces . I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men—many concubines .
21:2:009:0	Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem . My wisdom also stood by me .
21:2:010:0	All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them . I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure , for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor .
21:2:002:1	Wisdom Excels Folly
21:2:011:0	Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted , and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun .
21:2:012:0	So I turned to consider wisdom , madness and folly ; for what will the man do who will come after the king except what has already been done ?
21:2:013:0	And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness .
21:2:014:0	The wise man’s eyes are in his head , but the fool walks in darkness . And yet I know that one fate befalls them both .
21:2:015:0	Then I said to myself , “ As is the fate of the fool , it will also befall me . Why then have I been extremely wise ? ” So I said to myself , “ This too is vanity . ”
21:2:016:0	For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man as with the fool , inasmuch as in the coming days all will be forgotten . And how the wise man and the fool alike die !
21:2:003:1	The Futility of Labor
21:2:017:0	So I hated life , for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me ; because everything is futility and striving after wind .
21:2:018:0	Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun , for I must leave it to the man who will come after me .
21:2:019:0	And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool ? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun . This too is vanity .
21:2:020:0	Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun .
21:2:021:0	When there is a man who has labored with wisdom , knowledge and skill , then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them . This too is vanity and a great evil .
21:2:022:0	For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun ?
21:2:023:0	Because all his days his task is painful and grievous ; even at night his mind does not rest . This too is vanity .
21:2:024:0	There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good . This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God .
21:2:025:0	For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him ?
21:2:026:0	For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy , while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God’s sight . This too is vanity and striving after wind .
