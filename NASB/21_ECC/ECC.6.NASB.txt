21:6:001:1	The Futility of Life
21:6:001:0	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men—
21:6:002:0	a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires ; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them , for a foreigner enjoys them . This is vanity and a severe affliction .
21:6:003:0	If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years , however many they be , but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial , then I say , “ Better the miscarriage than he ,
21:6:004:0	for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity ; and its name is covered in obscurity .
21:6:005:0	It never sees the sun and it never knows anything ; it is better off than he .
21:6:006:0	Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things—do not all go to one place ? ”
21:6:007:0	All a man’s labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied .
21:6:008:0	For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool ? What advantage does the poor man have , knowing how to walk before the living ?
21:6:009:0	What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires . This too is futility and a striving after wind .
21:6:010:0	Whatever exists has already been named , and it is known what man is ; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is .
21:6:011:0	For there are many words which increase futility . What then is the advantage to a man ?
21:6:012:0	For who knows what is good for a man during his lifetime , during the few years of his futile life ? He will spend them like a shadow . For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun ?
