21:8:001:1	Obey Rulers
21:8:001:0	Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter ? A man’s wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam .
21:8:002:0	I say , “ Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God .
21:8:003:0	Do not be in a hurry to leave him . Do not join in an evil matter , for he will do whatever he pleases . ”
21:8:004:0	Since the word of the king is authoritative , who will say to him , “ What are you doing ? ”
21:8:005:0	He who keeps a royal command experiences no trouble , for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure .
21:8:006:0	For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight , though a man’s trouble is heavy upon him .
21:8:007:0	If no one knows what will happen , who can tell him when it will happen ?
21:8:008:0	No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind , or authority over the day of death ; and there is no discharge in the time of war , and evil will not deliver those who practice it .
21:8:009:0	All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over another man to his hurt .
21:8:010:0	So then , I have seen the wicked buried , those who used to go in and out from the holy place , and they are soon forgotten in the city where they did thus . This too is futility .
21:8:011:0	Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly , therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil .
21:8:012:0	Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and may lengthen his life , still I know that it will be well for those who fear God , who fear Him openly .
21:8:013:0	But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow , because he does not fear God .
21:8:014:0	There is futility which is done on the earth , that is , there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked . On the other hand , there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous . I say that this too is futility .
21:8:015:0	So I commended pleasure , for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry , and this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life which God has given him under the sun .
21:8:016:0	When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth ( even though one should never sleep day or night ) ,
21:8:017:0	and I saw every work of God , I concluded that man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun . Even though man should seek laboriously , he will not discover ; and though the wise man should say , “ I know , ” he cannot discover .
