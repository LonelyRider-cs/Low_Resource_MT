21:7:001:1	Wisdom and Folly Contrasted
21:7:001:0	A good name is better than a good ointment , And the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth .
21:7:002:0	It is better to go to a house of mourningThan to go to a house of feasting , Because that is the end of every man , And the living takes it to heart .
21:7:003:0	Sorrow is better than laughter , For when a face is sad a heart may be happy .
21:7:004:0	The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning , While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure .
21:7:005:0	It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise manThan for one to listen to the song of fools .
21:7:006:0	For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot , So is the laughter of the fool ; And this too is futility .
21:7:007:0	For oppression makes a wise man mad , And a bribe corrupts the heart .
21:7:008:0	The end of a matter is better than its beginning ; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit .
21:7:009:0	Do not be eager in your heart to be angry , For anger resides in the bosom of fools .
21:7:010:0	Do not say , “ Why is it that the former days were better than these ? ” For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this .
21:7:011:0	Wisdom along with an inheritance is goodAnd an advantage to those who see the sun .
21:7:012:0	For wisdom is protection just as money is protection , But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors .
21:7:013:0	Consider the work of God , For who is able to straighten what He has bent ?
21:7:014:0	In the day of prosperity be happy , But in the day of adversity consider—God has made the one as well as the otherSo that man will not discover anything that will be after him .
21:7:015:0	I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility ; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness .
21:7:016:0	Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise . Why should you ruin yourself ?
21:7:017:0	Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool . Why should you die before your time ?
21:7:018:0	It is good that you grasp one thing and also not let go of the other ; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them .
21:7:019:0	Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city .
21:7:020:0	Indeed , there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins .
21:7:021:0	Also , do not take seriously all words which are spoken , so that you will not hear your servant cursing you .
21:7:022:0	For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others .
21:7:023:0	I tested all this with wisdom , and I said , “ I will be wise , ” but it was far from me .
21:7:024:0	What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious . Who can discover it ?
21:7:025:0	I directed my mind to know , to investigate and to seek wisdom and an explanation , and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness .
21:7:026:0	And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets , whose hands are chains . One who is pleasing to God will escape from her , but the sinner will be captured by her .
21:7:027:0	“ Behold , I have discovered this , ” says the Preacher , “ adding one thing to another to find an explanation ,
21:7:028:0	which I am still seeking but have not found . I have found one man among a thousand , but I have not found a woman among all these .
21:7:029:0	Behold , I have found only this , that God made men upright , but they have sought out many devices . ”
