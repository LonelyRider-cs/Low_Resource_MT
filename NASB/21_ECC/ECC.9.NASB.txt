21:9:001:1	Men Are in the Hand of God
21:9:001:0	For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men , wise men , and their deeds are in the hand of God . Man does not know whether it will be love or hatred ; anything awaits him .
21:9:002:0	It is the same for all . There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked ; for the good , for the clean and for the unclean ; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice . As the good man is , so is the sinner ; as the swearer is , so is the one who is afraid to swear .
21:9:003:0	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun , that there is one fate for all men . Furthermore , the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives . Afterwards they go to the dead .
21:9:004:0	For whoever is joined with all the living , there is hope ; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion .
21:9:005:0	For the living know they will die ; but the dead do not know anything , nor have they any longer a reward , for their memory is forgotten .
21:9:006:0	Indeed their love , their hate and their zeal have already perished , and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun .
21:9:007:0	Go then , eat your bread in happiness and drink your wine with a cheerful heart ; for God has already approved your works .
21:9:008:0	Let your clothes be white all the time , and let not oil be lacking on your head .
21:9:002:1	Whatever Your Hand Finds to Do
21:9:009:0	Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun ; for this is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun .
21:9:010:0	Whatever your hand finds to do , do it with all your might ; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going .
21:9:011:0	I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors , and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability ; for time and chance overtake them all .
21:9:012:0	Moreover , man does not know his time : like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare , so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them .
21:9:013:0	Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun , and it impressed me .
21:9:014:0	There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it , surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks against it .
21:9:015:0	But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom . Yet no one remembered that poor man .
21:9:016:0	So I said , “ Wisdom is better than strength . ” But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded .
21:9:017:0	The words of the wise heard in quietness are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools .
21:9:018:0	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but one sinner destroys much good .
