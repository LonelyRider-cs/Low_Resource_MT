61:2:001:1	The Rise of False Prophets
61:2:001:0	But false prophets also arose among the people , just as there will also be false teachers among you , who will secretly introduce destructive heresies , even denying the Master who bought them , bringing swift destruction upon themselves .
61:2:002:0	Many will follow their sensuality , and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned ;
61:2:003:0	and in their greed they will exploit you with false words ; their judgment from long ago is not idle , and their destruction is not asleep .
61:2:004:0	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness , reserved for judgment ;
61:2:005:0	and did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a preacher of righteousness , with seven others , when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
61:2:006:0	and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter ;
61:2:007:0	and if He rescued righteous Lot , oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men
61:2:008:0	( for by what he saw and heard that righteous man , while living among them , felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds ) ,
61:2:009:0	then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment ,
61:2:010:0	and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority . Daring , self-willed , they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties ,
61:2:011:0	whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord .
61:2:012:0	But these , like unreasoning animals , born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed , reviling where they have no knowledge , will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed ,
61:2:013:0	suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong . They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime . They are stains and blemishes , reveling in their deceptions , as they carouse with you ,
61:2:014:0	having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin , enticing unstable souls , having a heart trained in greed , accursed children ;
61:2:015:0	forsaking the right way , they have gone astray , having followed the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
61:2:016:0	but he received a rebuke for his own transgression , for a mute donkey , speaking with a voice of a man , restrained the madness of the prophet .
61:2:017:0	These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm , for whom the black darkness has been reserved .
61:2:018:0	For speaking out arrogant words of vanity they entice by fleshly desires , by sensuality , those who barely escape from the ones who live in error ,
61:2:019:0	promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for by what a man is overcome , by this he is enslaved .
61:2:020:0	For if , after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in them and are overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
61:2:021:0	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known it , to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them .
61:2:022:0	It has happened to them according to the true proverb , “ A dog returns to its own vomit , ” and , “ A sow , after washing , returns to wallowing in the mire . ”
