44:1:001:1	Introduction
44:1:001:0	The first account I composed , Theophilus , about all that Jesus began to do and teach ,
44:1:002:0	until the day when He was taken up to heaven , after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen .
44:1:003:0	To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering , by many convincing proofs , appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God .
44:1:004:0	Gathering them together , He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem , but to wait for what the Father had promised , “ Which , ” He said , “ you heard of from Me ;
44:1:005:0	for John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now . ”
44:1:006:0	So when they had come together , they were asking Him , saying , “ Lord , is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel ? ”
44:1:007:0	He said to them , “ It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority ;
44:1:002:1	The Ascension
44:1:008:0	but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you ; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and even to the remotest part of the earth . ”
44:1:009:0	And after He had said these things , He was lifted up while they were looking on , and a cloud received Him out of their sight .
44:1:010:0	And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going , behold , two men in white clothing stood beside them .
44:1:003:1	The Upper Room
44:1:011:0	They also said , “ Men of Galilee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? This Jesus , who has been taken up from you into heaven , will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven . ”
44:1:012:0	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day’s journey away .
44:1:013:0	When they had entered the city , they went up to the upper room where they were staying ; that is , Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
44:1:014:0	These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with His brothers .
44:1:015:0	At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren ( a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together ) , and said ,
44:1:016:0	“ Brethren , the Scripture had to be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas , who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus .
44:1:017:0	For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry . ”
44:1:018:0	( Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness , and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out .
44:1:019:0	And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem ; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama , that is , Field of Blood . )
44:1:020:0	“ For it is written in the book of Psalms , ‘Let his homestead be made desolate , And let no one dwell in it’ ; and , ‘Let another man take his office . ’
44:1:021:0	Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us—
44:1:022:0	beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us—one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection . ”
44:1:023:0	So they put forward two men , Joseph called Barsabbas ( who was also called Justus ) , and Matthias .
44:1:024:0	And they prayed and said , “ You , Lord , who know the hearts of all men , show which one of these two You have chosen
44:1:025:0	to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place . ”
44:1:026:0	And they drew lots for them , and the lot fell to Matthias ; and he was added to the eleven apostles .
