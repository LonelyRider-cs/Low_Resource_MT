44:24:001:1	Paul before Felix
44:24:001:0	After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders , with an attorney named Tertullus , and they brought charges to the governor against Paul .
44:24:002:0	After Paul had been summoned , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying to the governor , “ Since we have through you attained much peace , and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation ,
44:24:003:0	we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere , most excellent Felix , with all thankfulness .
44:24:004:0	But , that I may not weary you any further , I beg you to grant us , by your kindness , a brief hearing .
44:24:005:0	For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44:24:006:0	And he even tried to desecrate the temple ; and then we arrested him . [ We wanted to judge him according to our own Law .
44:24:007:0	But Lysias the commander came along , and with much violence took him out of our hands ,
44:24:008:0	ordering his accusers to come before you . ] By examining him yourself concerning all these matters you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him . ”
44:24:009:0	The Jews also joined in the attack , asserting that these things were so .
44:24:010:0	When the governor had nodded for him to speak , Paul responded : “ Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation , I cheerfully make my defense ,
44:24:011:0	since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship .
44:24:012:0	Neither in the temple , nor in the synagogues , nor in the city itself did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot .
44:24:013:0	Nor can they prove to you the charges of which they now accuse me .
44:24:014:0	But this I admit to you , that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers , believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets ;
44:24:015:0	having a hope in God , which these men cherish themselves , that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked .
44:24:016:0	In view of this , I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience both before God and before men .
44:24:017:0	Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings ;
44:24:018:0	in which they found me occupied in the temple , having been purified , without any crowd or uproar . But there were some Jews from Asia—
44:24:019:0	who ought to have been present before you and to make accusation , if they should have anything against me .
44:24:020:0	Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council ,
44:24:021:0	other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them , ‘For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today . ’ ”
44:24:022:0	But Felix , having a more exact knowledge about the Way , put them off , saying , “ When Lysias the commander comes down , I will decide your case . ”
44:24:023:0	Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom , and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him .
44:24:024:0	But some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla , his wife who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus .
44:24:025:0	But as he was discussing righteousness , self-control and the judgment to come , Felix became frightened and said , “ Go away for the present , and when I find time I will summon you . ”
44:24:026:0	At the same time too , he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul ; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him .
44:24:027:0	But after two years had passed , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and wishing to do the Jews a favor , Felix left Paul imprisoned .
