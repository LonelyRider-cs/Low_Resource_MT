44:28:001:1	Safe at Malta
44:28:001:0	When they had been brought safely through , then we found out that the island was called Malta .
44:28:002:0	The natives showed us extraordinary kindness ; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold , they kindled a fire and received us all .
44:28:003:0	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand .
44:28:004:0	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they began saying to one another , “ Undoubtedly this man is a murderer , and though he has been saved from the sea , justice has not allowed him to live . ”
44:28:005:0	However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm .
44:28:006:0	But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead . But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him , they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god .
44:28:007:0	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island , named Publius , who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days .
44:28:008:0	And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery ; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed , he laid his hands on him and healed him .
44:28:009:0	After this had happened , the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured .
44:28:002:1	Paul Arrives at Rome
44:28:010:0	They also honored us with many marks of respect ; and when we were setting sail , they supplied us with all we needed .
44:28:011:0	At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island , and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead .
44:28:012:0	After we put in at Syracuse , we stayed there for three days .
44:28:013:0	From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium , and a day later a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli .
44:28:014:0	There we found some brethren , and were invited to stay with them for seven days ; and thus we came to Rome .
44:28:015:0	And the brethren , when they heard about us , came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us ; and when Paul saw them , he thanked God and took courage .
44:28:016:0	When we entered Rome , Paul was allowed to stay by himself , with the soldier who was guarding him .
44:28:017:0	After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews , and when they came together , he began saying to them , “ Brethren , though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers , yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44:28:018:0	And when they had examined me , they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death .
44:28:019:0	But when the Jews objected , I was forced to appeal to Caesar , not that I had any accusation against my nation .
44:28:020:0	For this reason , therefore , I requested to see you and to speak with you , for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel . ”
44:28:021:0	They said to him , “ We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you , nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you .
44:28:022:0	But we desire to hear from you what your views are ; for concerning this sect , it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere . ”
44:28:023:0	When they had set a day for Paul , they came to him at his lodging in large numbers ; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus , from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets , from morning until evening .
44:28:024:0	Some were being persuaded by the things spoken , but others would not believe .
44:28:025:0	And when they did not agree with one another , they began leaving after Paul had spoken one parting word , “ The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers ,
44:28:026:0	saying , ‘Go to this people and say , “ You will keep on hearing , but will not understand ; And you will keep on seeing , but will not perceive ;
44:28:027:0	For the heart of this people has become dull , And with their ears they scarcely hear , And they have closed their eyes ; Otherwise they might see with their eyes , And hear with their ears , And understand with their heart and return , And I would heal them . ” ’
44:28:028:0	Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles ; they will also listen . ”
44:28:029:0	[ When he had spoken these words , the Jews departed , having a great dispute among themselves . ]
44:28:030:0	And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters and was welcoming all who came to him ,
44:28:031:0	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness , unhindered .
