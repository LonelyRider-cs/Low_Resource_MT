44:22:001:1	Paul’s Defense before the Jews
44:22:001:0	“ Brethren and fathers , hear my defense which I now offer to you . ”
44:22:002:0	And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect , they became even more quiet ; and he *said ,
44:22:003:0	“ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus of Cilicia , but brought up in this city , educated under Gamaliel , strictly according to the law of our fathers , being zealous for God just as you all are today .
44:22:004:0	I persecuted this Way to the death , binding and putting both men and women into prisons ,
44:22:005:0	as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify . From them I also received letters to the brethren , and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished .
44:22:006:0	“ But it happened that as I was on my way , approaching Damascus about noontime , a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me ,
44:22:007:0	and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me ? ’
44:22:008:0	And I answered , ‘Who are You , Lord ? ’ And He said to me , ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are persecuting . ’
44:22:009:0	And those who were with me saw the light , to be sure , but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me .
44:22:010:0	And I said , ‘What shall I do , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said to me , ‘Get up and go on into Damascus , and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do . ’
44:22:011:0	But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light , I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus .
44:22:012:0	“ A certain Ananias , a man who was devout by the standard of the Law , and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there ,
44:22:013:0	came to me , and standing near said to me , ‘Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ’ And at that very time I looked up at him .
44:22:014:0	And he said , ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear an utterance from His mouth .
44:22:015:0	For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard .
44:22:016:0	Now why do you delay ? Get up and be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on His name . ’
44:22:017:0	“ It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple , that I fell into a trance ,
44:22:018:0	and I saw Him saying to me , ‘Make haste , and get out of Jerusalem quickly , because they will not accept your testimony about Me . ’
44:22:019:0	And I said , ‘Lord , they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You .
44:22:020:0	And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed , I also was standing by approving , and watching out for the coats of those who were slaying him . ’
44:22:021:0	And He said to me , ‘Go ! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ ”
44:22:022:0	They listened to him up to this statement , and then they raised their voices and said , “ Away with such a fellow from the earth , for he should not be allowed to live ! ”
44:22:023:0	And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air ,
44:22:024:0	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks , stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way .
44:22:025:0	But when they stretched him out with thongs , Paul said to the centurion who was standing by , “ Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned ? ”
44:22:026:0	When the centurion heard this , he went to the commander and told him , saying , “ What are you about to do ? For this man is a Roman . ”
44:22:027:0	The commander came and said to him , “ Tell me , are you a Roman ? ” And he said , “ Yes . ”
44:22:028:0	The commander answered , “ I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money . ” And Paul said , “ But I was actually born a citizen . ”
44:22:029:0	Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him ; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman , and because he had put him in chains .
44:22:030:0	But on the next day , wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews , he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble , and brought Paul down and set him before them .
