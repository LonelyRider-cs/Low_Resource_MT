44:15:001:1	The Council at Jerusalem
44:15:001:0	Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren , “ Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . ”
44:15:002:0	And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them , the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue .
44:15:003:0	Therefore , being sent on their way by the church , they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria , describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles , and were bringing great joy to all the brethren .
44:15:004:0	When they arrived at Jerusalem , they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders , and they reported all that God had done with them .
44:15:005:0	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up , saying , “ It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses . ”
44:15:006:0	The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter .
44:15:007:0	After there had been much debate , Peter stood up and said to them , “ Brethren , you know that in the early days God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe .
44:15:008:0	And God , who knows the heart , testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit , just as He also did to us ;
44:15:009:0	and He made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by faith .
44:15:010:0	Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44:15:011:0	But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , in the same way as they also are . ”
44:15:002:1	James’s Judgment
44:15:012:0	All the people kept silent , and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles .
44:15:013:0	After they had stopped speaking , James answered , saying , “ Brethren , listen to me .
44:15:014:0	Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name .
44:15:015:0	With this the words of the Prophets agree , just as it is written ,
44:15:016:0	‘After these things I will return , And I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen , And I will rebuild its ruins , And I will restore it ,
44:15:017:0	So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord , And all the Gentiles who are called by My name , ’
44:15:018:0	Says the Lord , who makes these things known from long ago .
44:15:019:0	Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles ,
44:15:020:0	but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood .
44:15:021:0	For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him , since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath . ”
44:15:022:0	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , with the whole church , to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas called Barsabbas , and Silas , leading men among the brethren ,
44:15:023:0	and they sent this letter by them , “ The apostles and the brethren who are elders , to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles , greetings .
44:15:024:0	Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with their words , unsettling your souls ,
44:15:025:0	it seemed good to us , having become of one mind , to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44:15:026:0	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44:15:027:0	Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas , who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth .
44:15:028:0	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials :
44:15:029:0	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication ; if you keep yourselves free from such things , you will do well . Farewell . ”
44:15:030:0	So when they were sent away , they went down to Antioch ; and having gathered the congregation together , they delivered the letter .
44:15:031:0	When they had read it , they rejoiced because of its encouragement .
44:15:032:0	Judas and Silas , also being prophets themselves , encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message .
44:15:033:0	After they had spent time there , they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out .
44:15:034:0	[ But it seemed good to Silas to remain there . ]
44:15:003:1	Second Missionary Journey
44:15:035:0	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch , teaching and preaching with many others also , the word of the Lord .
44:15:036:0	After some days Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , and see how they are . ”
44:15:037:0	Barnabas wanted to take John , called Mark , along with them also .
44:15:038:0	But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work .
44:15:039:0	And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another , and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus .
44:15:040:0	But Paul chose Silas and left , being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord .
44:15:041:0	And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
