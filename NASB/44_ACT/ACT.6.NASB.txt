44:6:001:1	Choosing of the Seven
44:6:001:0	Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in number , a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Hebrews , because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving of food .
44:6:002:0	So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said , “ It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables .
44:6:003:0	Therefore , brethren , select from among you seven men of good reputation , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may put in charge of this task .
44:6:004:0	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word . ”
44:6:005:0	The statement found approval with the whole congregation ; and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , and Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas and Nicolas , a proselyte from Antioch .
44:6:006:0	And these they brought before the apostles ; and after praying , they laid their hands on them .
44:6:007:0	The word of God kept on spreading ; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem , and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith .
44:6:008:0	And Stephen , full of grace and power , was performing great wonders and signs among the people .
44:6:009:0	But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen , including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians , and some from Cilicia and Asia , rose up and argued with Stephen .
44:6:010:0	But they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking .
44:6:011:0	Then they secretly induced men to say , “ We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God . ”
44:6:012:0	And they stirred up the people , the elders and the scribes , and they came up to him and dragged him away and brought him before the Council .
44:6:013:0	They put forward false witnesses who said , “ This man incessantly speaks against this holy place and the Law ;
44:6:014:0	for we have heard him say that this Nazarene , Jesus , will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us . ”
44:6:015:0	And fixing their gaze on him , all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel .
