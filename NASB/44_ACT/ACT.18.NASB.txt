44:18:001:1	Paul at Corinth
44:18:001:0	After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth .
44:18:002:0	And he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome . He came to them ,
44:18:003:0	and because he was of the same trade , he stayed with them and they were working , for by trade they were tent-makers .
44:18:004:0	And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks .
44:18:005:0	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul began devoting himself completely to the word , solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44:18:006:0	But when they resisted and blasphemed , he shook out his garments and said to them , “ Your blood be on your own heads ! I am clean . From now on I will go to the Gentiles . ”
44:18:007:0	Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus , a worshiper of God , whose house was next to the synagogue .
44:18:008:0	Crispus , the leader of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his household , and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized .
44:18:009:0	And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision , “ Do not be afraid but go on speaking and do not be silent ;
44:18:010:0	for I am with you , and no man will attack you in order to harm you , for I have many people in this city . ”
44:18:011:0	And he settled there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44:18:012:0	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat ,
44:18:013:0	saying , “ This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law . ”
44:18:014:0	But when Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , “ If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime , O Jews , it would be reasonable for me to put up with you ;
44:18:015:0	but if there are questions about words and names and your own law , look after it yourselves ; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters . ”
44:18:016:0	And he drove them away from the judgment seat .
44:18:017:0	And they all took hold of Sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue , and began beating him in front of the judgment seat . But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things .
44:18:018:0	Paul , having remained many days longer , took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria , and with him were Priscilla and Aquila . In Cenchrea he had his hair cut , for he was keeping a vow .
44:18:019:0	They came to Ephesus , and he left them there . Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews .
44:18:020:0	When they asked him to stay for a longer time , he did not consent ,
44:18:021:0	but taking leave of them and saying , “ I will return to you again if God wills , ” he set sail from Ephesus .
44:18:002:1	Third Missionary Journey
44:18:022:0	When he had landed at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the church , and went down to Antioch .
44:18:023:0	And having spent some time there , he left and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples .
44:18:024:0	Now a Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by birth , an eloquent man , came to Ephesus ; and he was mighty in the Scriptures .
44:18:025:0	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus , being acquainted only with the baptism of John ;
44:18:026:0	and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue . But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
44:18:027:0	And when he wanted to go across to Achaia , the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him ; and when he had arrived , he greatly helped those who had believed through grace ,
44:18:028:0	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public , demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
