44:20:001:1	Paul in Macedonia and Greece
44:20:001:0	After the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them , he left to go to Macedonia .
44:20:002:0	When he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation , he came to Greece .
44:20:003:0	And there he spent three months , and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he decided to return through Macedonia .
44:20:004:0	And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea , the son of Pyrrhus , and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians , and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy , and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia .
44:20:005:0	But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas .
44:20:006:0	We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread , and came to them at Troas within five days ; and there we stayed seven days .
44:20:007:0	On the first day of the week , when we were gathered together to break bread , Paul began talking to them , intending to leave the next day , and he prolonged his message until midnight .
44:20:008:0	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together .
44:20:009:0	And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill , sinking into a deep sleep ; and as Paul kept on talking , he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead .
44:20:010:0	But Paul went down and fell upon him , and after embracing him , he said , “ Do not be troubled , for his life is in him . ”
44:20:011:0	When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten , he talked with them a long while until daybreak , and then left .
44:20:002:1	Troas to Miletus
44:20:012:0	They took away the boy alive , and were greatly comforted .
44:20:013:0	But we , going ahead to the ship , set sail for Assos , intending from there to take Paul on board ; for so he had arranged it , intending himself to go by land .
44:20:014:0	And when he met us at Assos , we took him on board and came to Mitylene .
44:20:015:0	Sailing from there , we arrived the following day opposite Chios ; and the next day we crossed over to Samos ; and the day following we came to Miletus .
44:20:003:1	Farewell to Ephesus
44:20:016:0	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem , if possible , on the day of Pentecost .
44:20:017:0	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church .
44:20:018:0	And when they had come to him , he said to them , “ You yourselves know , from the first day that I set foot in Asia , how I was with you the whole time ,
44:20:019:0	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews ;
44:20:020:0	how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable , and teaching you publicly and from house to house ,
44:20:021:0	solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ .
44:20:022:0	And now , behold , bound by the Spirit , I am on my way to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there ,
44:20:023:0	except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions await me .
44:20:024:0	But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself , so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God .
44:20:025:0	“ And now , behold , I know that all of you , among whom I went about preaching the kingdom , will no longer see my face .
44:20:026:0	Therefore , I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men .
44:20:027:0	For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God .
44:20:028:0	Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock , among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood .
44:20:029:0	I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock ;
44:20:030:0	and from among your own selves men will arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
44:20:031:0	Therefore be on the alert , remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears .
44:20:032:0	And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace , which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified .
44:20:033:0	I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothes .
44:20:034:0	You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me .
44:20:035:0	In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that He Himself said , ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44:20:036:0	When he had said these things , he knelt down and prayed with them all .
44:20:037:0	And they began to weep aloud and embraced Paul , and repeatedly kissed him ,
44:20:038:0	grieving especially over the word which he had spoken , that they would not see his face again . And they were accompanying him to the ship .
