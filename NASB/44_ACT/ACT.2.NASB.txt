44:2:001:1	The Day of Pentecost
44:2:001:0	When the day of Pentecost had come , they were all together in one place .
44:2:002:0	And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing wind , and it filled the whole house where they were sitting .
44:2:003:0	And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves , and they rested on each one of them .
44:2:004:0	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit was giving them utterance .
44:2:005:0	Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem , devout men from every nation under heaven .
44:2:006:0	And when this sound occurred , the crowd came together , and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language .
44:2:007:0	They were amazed and astonished , saying , “ Why , are not all these who are speaking Galileans ?
44:2:008:0	And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born ?
44:2:009:0	Parthians and Medes and Elamites , and residents of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44:2:010:0	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene , and visitors from Rome , both Jews and proselytes ,
44:2:011:0	Cretans and Arabs—we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God . ”
44:2:012:0	And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity , saying to one another , “ What does this mean ? ”
44:2:002:1	Peter’s Sermon
44:2:013:0	But others were mocking and saying , “ They are full of sweet wine . ”
44:2:014:0	But Peter , taking his stand with the eleven , raised his voice and declared to them : “ Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem , let this be known to you and give heed to my words .
44:2:015:0	For these men are not drunk , as you suppose , for it is only the third hour of the day ;
44:2:016:0	but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel :
44:2:017:0	‘And it shall be in the last days , ’ God says , ‘That I will pour forth of My Spirit on all mankind ; And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , And your young men shall see visions , And your old men shall dream dreams ;
44:2:018:0	Even on My bondslaves , both men and women , I will in those days pour forth of My SpiritAnd they shall prophesy .
44:2:019:0	And I will grant wonders in the sky aboveAnd signs on the earth below , Blood , and fire , and vapor of smoke .
44:2:020:0	The sun will be turned into darknessAnd the moon into blood , Before the great and glorious day of the Lord shall come .
44:2:021:0	And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . ’
44:2:022:0	“ Men of Israel , listen to these words : Jesus the Nazarene , a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst , just as you yourselves know—
44:2:023:0	this Man , delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God , you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death .
44:2:024:0	But God raised Him up again , putting an end to the agony of death , since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power .
44:2:025:0	For David says of Him , ‘I saw the Lord always in my presence ; For He is at my right hand , so that I will not be shaken .
44:2:026:0	Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue exulted ; Moreover my flesh also will live in hope ;
44:2:027:0	Because You will not abandon my soul to Hades , Nor allow Your Holy One to undergo decay .
44:2:028:0	You have made known to me the ways of life ; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence . ’
44:2:029:0	“ Brethren , I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44:2:030:0	And so , because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne ,
44:2:031:0	he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ , that He was neither abandoned to Hades , nor did His flesh suffer decay .
44:2:032:0	This Jesus God raised up again , to which we are all witnesses .
44:2:033:0	Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , He has poured forth this which you both see and hear .
44:2:034:0	For it was not David who ascended into heaven , but he himself says : ‘The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at My right hand ,
44:2:035:0	Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet . ” ’
44:2:003:1	The Ingathering
44:2:036:0	Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified . ”
44:2:037:0	Now when they heard this , they were pierced to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles , “ Brethren , what shall we do ? ”
44:2:038:0	Peter said to them , “ Repent , and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins ; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44:2:039:0	For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off , as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself . ”
44:2:040:0	And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them , saying , “ Be saved from this perverse generation ! ”
44:2:041:0	So then , those who had received his word were baptized ; and that day there were added about three thousand souls .
44:2:042:0	They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship , to the breaking of bread and to prayer .
44:2:043:0	Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe ; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles .
44:2:044:0	And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common ;
44:2:045:0	and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all , as anyone might have need .
44:2:046:0	Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart ,
44:2:047:0	praising God and having favor with all the people . And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved .
