44:4:001:1	Peter and John Arrested
44:4:001:0	As they were speaking to the people , the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them ,
44:4:002:0	being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44:4:003:0	And they laid hands on them and put them in jail until the next day , for it was already evening .
44:4:004:0	But many of those who had heard the message believed ; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
44:4:005:0	On the next day , their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem ;
44:4:006:0	and Annas the high priest was there , and Caiaphas and John and Alexander , and all who were of high-priestly descent .
44:4:007:0	When they had placed them in the center , they began to inquire , “ By what power , or in what name , have you done this ? ”
44:4:008:0	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , “ Rulers and elders of the people ,
44:4:009:0	if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man , as to how this man has been made well ,
44:4:010:0	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead—by this name this man stands here before you in good health .
44:4:011:0	He is the stone which was rejected by you , the builders , but which became the chief corner stone .
44:4:002:1	Threat and Release
44:4:012:0	And there is salvation in no one else ; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved . ”
44:4:013:0	Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men , they were amazed , and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus .
44:4:014:0	And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them , they had nothing to say in reply .
44:4:015:0	But when they had ordered them to leave the Council , they began to confer with one another ,
44:4:016:0	saying , “ What shall we do with these men ? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem , and we cannot deny it .
44:4:017:0	But so that it will not spread any further among the people , let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name . ”
44:4:018:0	And when they had summoned them , they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus .
44:4:019:0	But Peter and John answered and said to them , “ Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God , you be the judge ;
44:4:020:0	for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard . ”
44:4:021:0	When they had threatened them further , they let them go ( finding no basis on which to punish them ) on account of the people , because they were all glorifying God for what had happened ;
44:4:022:0	for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed .
44:4:023:0	When they had been released , they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
44:4:024:0	And when they heard this , they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said , “ O Lord , it is You who made the heaven and the earth and the sea , and all that is in them ,
44:4:025:0	who by the Holy Spirit , through the mouth of our father David Your servant , said , ‘Why did the Gentiles rage , And the peoples devise futile things ?
44:4:026:0	The kings of the earth took their stand , And the rulers were gathered togetherAgainst the Lord and against His Christ . ’
44:4:027:0	For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus , whom You anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel ,
44:4:028:0	to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur .
44:4:029:0	And now , Lord , take note of their threats , and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence ,
44:4:030:0	while You extend Your hand to heal , and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus . ”
44:4:003:1	Sharing among Believers
44:4:031:0	And when they had prayed , the place where they had gathered together was shaken , and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness .
44:4:032:0	And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul ; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own , but all things were common property to them .
44:4:033:0	And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and abundant grace was upon them all .
44:4:034:0	For there was not a needy person among them , for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales
44:4:035:0	and lay them at the apostles’ feet , and they would be distributed to each as any had need .
44:4:036:0	Now Joseph , a Levite of Cyprian birth , who was also called Barnabas by the apostles ( which translated means Son of Encouragement ) ,
44:4:037:0	and who owned a tract of land , sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet .
