44:16:001:1	The Macedonian Vision
44:16:001:0	Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra . And a disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer , but his father was a Greek ,
44:16:002:0	and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium .
44:16:003:0	Paul wanted this man to go with him ; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts , for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
44:16:004:0	Now while they were passing through the cities , they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem , for them to observe .
44:16:005:0	So the churches were being strengthened in the faith , and were increasing in number daily .
44:16:006:0	They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region , having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia ;
44:16:007:0	and after they came to Mysia , they were trying to go into Bithynia , and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them ;
44:16:008:0	and passing by Mysia , they came down to Troas .
44:16:009:0	A vision appeared to Paul in the night : a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him , and saying , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us . ”
44:16:010:0	When he had seen the vision , immediately we sought to go into Macedonia , concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them .
44:16:011:0	So putting out to sea from Troas , we ran a straight course to Samothrace , and on the day following to Neapolis ;
44:16:012:0	and from there to Philippi , which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia , a Roman colony ; and we were staying in this city for some days .
44:16:002:1	First Convert in Europe
44:16:013:0	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside , where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer ; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled .
44:16:014:0	A woman named Lydia , from the city of Thyatira , a seller of purple fabrics , a worshiper of God , was listening ; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul .
44:16:015:0	And when she and her household had been baptized , she urged us , saying , “ If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house and stay . ” And she prevailed upon us .
44:16:016:0	It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer , a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us , who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling .
44:16:017:0	Following after Paul and us , she kept crying out , saying , “ These men are bond-servants of the Most High God , who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation . ”
44:16:018:0	She continued doing this for many days . But Paul was greatly annoyed , and turned and said to the spirit , “ I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! ” And it came out at that very moment .
44:16:019:0	But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone , they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities ,
44:16:020:0	and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates , they said , “ These men are throwing our city into confusion , being Jews ,
44:16:003:1	Paul and Silas Imprisoned
44:16:021:0	and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe , being Romans . ”
44:16:022:0	The crowd rose up together against them , and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods .
44:16:023:0	When they had struck them with many blows , they threw them into prison , commanding the jailer to guard them securely ;
44:16:024:0	and he , having received such a command , threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44:16:025:0	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God , and the prisoners were listening to them ;
44:16:026:0	and suddenly there came a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were unfastened .
44:16:027:0	When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened , he drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
44:16:028:0	But Paul cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Do not harm yourself , for we are all here ! ”
44:16:029:0	And he called for lights and rushed in , and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas ,
44:16:004:1	The Jailer Converted
44:16:030:0	and after he brought them out , he said , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44:16:031:0	They said , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved , you and your household . ”
44:16:032:0	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house .
44:16:033:0	And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds , and immediately he was baptized , he and all his household .
44:16:034:0	And he brought them into his house and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , having believed in God with his whole household .
44:16:035:0	Now when day came , the chief magistrates sent their policemen , saying , “ Release those men . ”
44:16:036:0	And the jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , “ The chief magistrates have sent to release you . Therefore come out now and go in peace . ”
44:16:037:0	But Paul said to them , “ They have beaten us in public without trial , men who are Romans , and have thrown us into prison ; and now are they sending us away secretly ? No indeed ! But let them come themselves and bring us out . ”
44:16:038:0	The policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates . They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans ,
44:16:039:0	and they came and appealed to them , and when they had brought them out , they kept begging them to leave the city .
44:16:040:0	They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia , and when they saw the brethren , they encouraged them and departed .
