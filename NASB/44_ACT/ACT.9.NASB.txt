44:9:001:1	The Conversion of Saul
44:9:001:0	Now Saul , still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
44:9:002:0	and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus , so that if he found any belonging to the Way , both men and women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
44:9:003:0	As he was traveling , it happened that he was approaching Damascus , and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him ;
44:9:004:0	and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me ? ”
44:9:005:0	And he said , “ Who are You , Lord ? ” And He said , “ I am Jesus whom you are persecuting ,
44:9:006:0	but get up and enter the city , and it will be told you what you must do . ”
44:9:007:0	The men who traveled with him stood speechless , hearing the voice but seeing no one .
44:9:008:0	Saul got up from the ground , and though his eyes were open , he could see nothing ; and leading him by the hand , they brought him into Damascus .
44:9:009:0	And he was three days without sight , and neither ate nor drank .
44:9:010:0	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias ; and the Lord said to him in a vision , “ Ananias . ” And he said , “ Here I am , Lord . ”
44:9:011:0	And the Lord said to him , “ Get up and go to the street called Straight , and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul , for he is praying ,
44:9:012:0	and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him , so that he might regain his sight . ”
44:9:013:0	But Ananias answered , “ Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem ;
44:9:014:0	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name . ”
44:9:015:0	But the Lord said to him , “ Go , for he is a chosen instrument of Mine , to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel ;
44:9:016:0	for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name’s sake . ”
44:9:017:0	So Ananias departed and entered the house , and after laying his hands on him said , “ Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming , has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44:9:018:0	And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales , and he regained his sight , and he got up and was baptized ;
44:9:002:1	Saul Begins to Preach Christ
44:9:019:0	and he took food and was strengthened . Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus ,
44:9:020:0	and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues , saying , “ He is the Son of God . ”
44:9:021:0	All those hearing him continued to be amazed , and were saying , “ Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name , and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests ? ”
44:9:022:0	But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ .
44:9:023:0	When many days had elapsed , the Jews plotted together to do away with him ,
44:9:024:0	but their plot became known to Saul . They were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death ;
44:9:025:0	but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall , lowering him in a large basket .
44:9:026:0	When he came to Jerusalem , he was trying to associate with the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
44:9:027:0	But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road , and that He had talked to him , and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus .
44:9:028:0	And he was with them , moving about freely in Jerusalem , speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord .
44:9:029:0	And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews ; but they were attempting to put him to death .
44:9:030:0	But when the brethren learned of it , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus .
44:9:003:1	Peter’s Ministry
44:9:031:0	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace , being built up ; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit , it continued to increase .
44:9:032:0	Now as Peter was traveling through all those regions , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
44:9:033:0	There he found a man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden eight years , for he was paralyzed .
44:9:034:0	Peter said to him , “ Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you ; get up and make your bed . ” Immediately he got up .
44:9:035:0	And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44:9:036:0	Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha ( which translated in Greek is called Dorcas ) ; this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did .
44:9:037:0	And it happened at that time that she fell sick and died ; and when they had washed her body , they laid it in an upper room .
44:9:038:0	Since Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , having heard that Peter was there , sent two men to him , imploring him , “ Do not delay in coming to us . ”
44:9:039:0	So Peter arose and went with them . When he arrived , they brought him into the upper room ; and all the widows stood beside him , weeping and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them .
44:9:040:0	But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed , and turning to the body , he said , “ Tabitha , arise . ” And she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44:9:041:0	And he gave her his hand and raised her up ; and calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
44:9:042:0	It became known all over Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
44:9:043:0	And Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon .
