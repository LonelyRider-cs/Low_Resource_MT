44:26:001:1	Paul’s Defense before Agrippa
44:26:001:0	Agrippa said to Paul , “ You are permitted to speak for yourself . ” Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to make his defense :
44:26:002:0	“ In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews , I consider myself fortunate , King Agrippa , that I am about to make my defense before you today ;
44:26:003:0	especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among the Jews ; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently .
44:26:004:0	“ So then , all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up , which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
44:26:005:0	since they have known about me for a long time , if they are willing to testify , that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion .
44:26:006:0	And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers ;
44:26:007:0	the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain , as they earnestly serve God night and day . And for this hope , O King , I am being accused by Jews .
44:26:008:0	Why is it considered incredible among you people if God does raise the dead ?
44:26:009:0	“ So then , I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44:26:010:0	And this is just what I did in Jerusalem ; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them .
44:26:011:0	And as I punished them often in all the synagogues , I tried to force them to blaspheme ; and being furiously enraged at them , I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities .
44:26:012:0	“ While so engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests ,
44:26:013:0	at midday , O King , I saw on the way a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining all around me and those who were journeying with me .
44:26:014:0	And when we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect , ‘Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goads . ’
44:26:015:0	And I said , ‘Who are You , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said , ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44:26:016:0	But get up and stand on your feet ; for this purpose I have appeared to you , to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen , but also to the things in which I will appear to you ;
44:26:017:0	rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles , to whom I am sending you ,
44:26:018:0	to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me . ’
44:26:019:0	“ So , King Agrippa , I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44:26:020:0	but kept declaring both to those of Damascus first , and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea , and even to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , performing deeds appropriate to repentance .
44:26:021:0	For this reason some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death .
44:26:022:0	So , having obtained help from God , I stand to this day testifying both to small and great , stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place ;
44:26:023:0	that the Christ was to suffer , and that by reason of His resurrection from the dead He would be the first to proclaim light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles . ”
44:26:024:0	While Paul was saying this in his defense , Festus *said in a loud voice , “ Paul , you are out of your mind ! Your great learning is driving you mad . ”
44:26:025:0	But Paul *said , “ I am not out of my mind , most excellent Festus , but I utter words of sober truth .
44:26:026:0	For the king knows about these matters , and I speak to him also with confidence , since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice ; for this has not been done in a corner .
44:26:027:0	King Agrippa , do you believe the Prophets ? I know that you do . ”
44:26:028:0	Agrippa replied to Paul , “ In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian . ”
44:26:029:0	And Paul said , “ I would wish to God , that whether in a short or long time , not only you , but also all who hear me this day , might become such as I am , except for these chains . ”
44:26:030:0	The king stood up and the governor and Bernice , and those who were sitting with them ,
44:26:031:0	and when they had gone aside , they began talking to one another , saying , “ This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment . ”
44:26:032:0	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . ”
