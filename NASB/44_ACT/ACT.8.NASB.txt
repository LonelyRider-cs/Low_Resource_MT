44:8:001:1	Saul Persecutes the Church
44:8:001:0	Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death . And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem , and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except the apostles .
44:8:002:0	Some devout men buried Stephen , and made loud lamentation over him .
44:8:002:1	Philip in Samaria
44:8:003:0	But Saul began ravaging the church , entering house after house , and dragging off men and women , he would put them in prison .
44:8:004:0	Therefore , those who had been scattered went about preaching the word .
44:8:005:0	Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming Christ to them .
44:8:006:0	The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip , as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing .
44:8:007:0	For in the case of many who had unclean spirits , they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice ; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed .
44:8:008:0	So there was much rejoicing in that city .
44:8:009:0	Now there was a man named Simon , who formerly was practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria , claiming to be someone great ;
44:8:010:0	and they all , from smallest to greatest , were giving attention to him , saying , “ This man is what is called the Great Power of God . ”
44:8:011:0	And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts .
44:8:012:0	But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were being baptized , men and women alike .
44:8:013:0	Even Simon himself believed ; and after being baptized , he continued on with Philip , and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place , he was constantly amazed .
44:8:014:0	Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent them Peter and John ,
44:8:015:0	who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
44:8:016:0	For He had not yet fallen upon any of them ; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44:8:017:0	Then they began laying their hands on them , and they were receiving the Holy Spirit .
44:8:018:0	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles’ hands , he offered them money ,
44:8:019:0	saying , “ Give this authority to me as well , so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit . ”
44:8:020:0	But Peter said to him , “ May your silver perish with you , because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money !
44:8:021:0	You have no part or portion in this matter , for your heart is not right before God .
44:8:022:0	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours , and pray the Lord that , if possible , the intention of your heart may be forgiven you .
44:8:023:0	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity . ”
44:8:003:1	An Ethiopian Receives Christ
44:8:024:0	But Simon answered and said , “ Pray to the Lord for me yourselves , so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me . ”
44:8:025:0	So , when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord , they started back to Jerusalem , and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans .
44:8:026:0	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying , “ Get up and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza . ” ( This is a desert road . )
44:8:027:0	So he got up and went ; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch , a court official of Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was in charge of all her treasure ; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship ,
44:8:028:0	and he was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet Isaiah .
44:8:029:0	Then the Spirit said to Philip , “ Go up and join this chariot . ”
44:8:030:0	Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and said , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44:8:031:0	And he said , “ Well , how could I , unless someone guides me ? ” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him .
44:8:032:0	Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this : “ He was led as a sheep to slaughter ; And as a lamb before its shearer is silent , So He does not open His mouth .
44:8:033:0	In humiliation His judgment was taken away ; Who will relate His generation ? For His life is removed from the earth . ”
44:8:034:0	The eunuch answered Philip and said , “ Please tell me , of whom does the prophet say this ? Of himself or of someone else ? ”
44:8:035:0	Then Philip opened his mouth , and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him .
44:8:036:0	As they went along the road they came to some water ; and the eunuch *said , “ Look ! Water ! What prevents me from being baptized ? ”
44:8:037:0	[ And Philip said , “ If you believe with all your heart , you may . ” And he answered and said , “ I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God . ” ]
44:8:038:0	And he ordered the chariot to stop ; and they both went down into the water , Philip as well as the eunuch , and he baptized him .
44:8:039:0	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away ; and the eunuch no longer saw him , but went on his way rejoicing .
44:8:040:0	But Philip found himself at Azotus , and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea .
