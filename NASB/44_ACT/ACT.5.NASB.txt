44:5:001:1	Fate of Ananias and Sapphira
44:5:001:0	But a man named Ananias , with his wife Sapphira , sold a piece of property ,
44:5:002:0	and kept back some of the price for himself , with his wife’s full knowledge , and bringing a portion of it , he laid it at the apostles’ feet .
44:5:003:0	But Peter said , “ Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land ?
44:5:004:0	While it remained unsold , did it not remain your own ? And after it was sold , was it not under your control ? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart ? You have not lied to men but to God . ”
44:5:005:0	And as he heard these words , Ananias fell down and breathed his last ; and great fear came over all who heard of it .
44:5:006:0	The young men got up and covered him up , and after carrying him out , they buried him .
44:5:007:0	Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours , and his wife came in , not knowing what had happened .
44:5:008:0	And Peter responded to her , “ Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price ? ” And she said , “ Yes , that was the price . ”
44:5:009:0	Then Peter said to her , “ Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test ? Behold , the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out as well . ”
44:5:010:0	And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last , and the young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44:5:011:0	And great fear came over the whole church , and over all who heard of these things .
44:5:012:0	At the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people ; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s portico .
44:5:013:0	But none of the rest dared to associate with them ; however , the people held them in high esteem .
44:5:014:0	And all the more believers in the Lord , multitudes of men and women , were constantly added to their number ,
44:5:015:0	to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them on cots and pallets , so that when Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on any one of them .
44:5:002:1	Imprisonment and Release
44:5:016:0	Also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together , bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits , and they were all being healed .
44:5:017:0	But the high priest rose up , along with all his associates ( that is the sect of the Sadducees ) , and they were filled with jealousy .
44:5:018:0	They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail .
44:5:019:0	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the gates of the prison , and taking them out he said ,
44:5:020:0	“ Go , stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life . ”
44:5:021:0	Upon hearing this , they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach . Now when the high priest and his associates came , they called the Council together , even all the Senate of the sons of Israel , and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought .
44:5:022:0	But the officers who came did not find them in the prison ; and they returned and reported back ,
44:5:023:0	saying , “ We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors ; but when we had opened up , we found no one inside . ”
44:5:024:0	Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words , they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this .
44:5:025:0	But someone came and reported to them , “ The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people ! ”
44:5:026:0	Then the captain went along with the officers and proceeded to bring them back without violence ( for they were afraid of the people , that they might be stoned ) .
44:5:027:0	When they had brought them , they stood them before the Council . The high priest questioned them ,
44:5:028:0	saying , “ We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name , and yet , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us . ”
44:5:029:0	But Peter and the apostles answered , “ We must obey God rather than men .
44:5:030:0	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross .
44:5:031:0	He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior , to grant repentance to Israel , and forgiveness of sins .
44:5:003:1	Gamaliel’s Counsel
44:5:032:0	And we are witnesses of these things ; and so is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey Him . ”
44:5:033:0	But when they heard this , they were cut to the quick and intended to kill them .
44:5:034:0	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel , a teacher of the Law , respected by all the people , stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time .
44:5:035:0	And he said to them , “ Men of Israel , take care what you propose to do with these men .
44:5:036:0	For some time ago Theudas rose up , claiming to be somebody , and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him . But he was killed , and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing .
44:5:037:0	After this man , Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him ; he too perished , and all those who followed him were scattered .
44:5:038:0	So in the present case , I say to you , stay away from these men and let them alone , for if this plan or action is of men , it will be overthrown ;
44:5:039:0	but if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow them ; or else you may even be found fighting against God . ”
44:5:040:0	They took his advice ; and after calling the apostles in , they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and then released them .
44:5:041:0	So they went on their way from the presence of the Council , rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name .
44:5:042:0	And every day , in the temple and from house to house , they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ .
