44:10:001:1	Cornelius’s Vision
44:10:001:0	Now there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius , a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort ,
44:10:002:0	a devout man and one who feared God with all his household , and gave many alms to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually .
44:10:003:0	About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him , “ Cornelius ! ”
44:10:004:0	And fixing his gaze on him and being much alarmed , he said , “ What is it , Lord ? ” And he said to him , “ Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God .
44:10:005:0	Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon , who is also called Peter ;
44:10:006:0	he is staying with a tanner named Simon , whose house is by the sea . ”
44:10:007:0	When the angel who was speaking to him had left , he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants ,
44:10:008:0	and after he had explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44:10:009:0	On the next day , as they were on their way and approaching the city , Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray .
44:10:010:0	But he became hungry and was desiring to eat ; but while they were making preparations , he fell into a trance ;
44:10:011:0	and he *saw the sky opened up , and an object like a great sheet coming down , lowered by four corners to the ground ,
44:10:012:0	and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air .
44:10:013:0	A voice came to him , “ Get up , Peter , kill and eat ! ”
44:10:014:0	But Peter said , “ By no means , Lord , for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean . ”
44:10:015:0	Again a voice came to him a second time , “ What God has cleansed , no longer consider unholy . ”
44:10:016:0	This happened three times , and immediately the object was taken up into the sky .
44:10:017:0	Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be , behold , the men who had been sent by Cornelius , having asked directions for Simon’s house , appeared at the gate ;
44:10:018:0	and calling out , they were asking whether Simon , who was also called Peter , was staying there .
44:10:019:0	While Peter was reflecting on the vision , the Spirit said to him , “ Behold , three men are looking for you .
44:10:020:0	But get up , go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings , for I have sent them Myself . ”
44:10:021:0	Peter went down to the men and said , “ Behold , I am the one you are looking for ; what is the reason for which you have come ? ”
44:10:022:0	They said , “ Cornelius , a centurion , a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews , was divinely directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear a message from you . ”
44:10:002:1	Peter at Caesarea
44:10:023:0	So he invited them in and gave them lodging . And on the next day he got up and went away with them , and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
44:10:024:0	On the following day he entered Caesarea . Now Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44:10:025:0	When Peter entered , Cornelius met him , and fell at his feet and worshiped him .
44:10:026:0	But Peter raised him up , saying , “ Stand up ; I too am just a man . ”
44:10:027:0	As he talked with him , he entered and *found many people assembled .
44:10:028:0	And he said to them , “ You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him ; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean .
44:10:029:0	That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for . So I ask for what reason you have sent for me . ”
44:10:030:0	Cornelius said , “ Four days ago to this hour , I was praying in my house during the ninth hour ; and behold , a man stood before me in shining garments ,
44:10:031:0	and he *said , ‘Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God .
44:10:032:0	Therefore send to Joppa and invite Simon , who is also called Peter , to come to you ; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea . ’
44:10:003:1	Gentiles Hear Good News
44:10:033:0	So I sent for you immediately , and you have been kind enough to come . Now then , we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord . ”
44:10:034:0	Opening his mouth , Peter said : “ I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality ,
44:10:035:0	but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him .
44:10:036:0	The word which He sent to the sons of Israel , preaching peace through Jesus Christ ( He is Lord of all ) —
44:10:037:0	you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea , starting from Galilee , after the baptism which John proclaimed .
44:10:038:0	You know of Jesus of Nazareth , how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power , and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with Him .
44:10:039:0	We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross .
44:10:040:0	God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible ,
44:10:041:0	not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God , that is , to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead .
44:10:042:0	And He ordered us to preach to the people , and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead .
44:10:043:0	Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins . ”
44:10:044:0	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message .
44:10:045:0	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed , because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also .
44:10:046:0	For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God . Then Peter answered ,
44:10:047:0	“ Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did , can he ? ”
44:10:048:0	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay on for a few days .
