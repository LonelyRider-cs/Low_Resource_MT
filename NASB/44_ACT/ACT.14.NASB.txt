44:14:001:1	Acceptance and Opposition
44:14:001:0	In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together , and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed , both of Jews and of Greeks .
44:14:002:0	But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren .
44:14:003:0	Therefore they spent a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord , who was testifying to the word of His grace , granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands .
44:14:004:0	But the people of the city were divided ; and some sided with the Jews , and some with the apostles .
44:14:005:0	And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers , to mistreat and to stone them ,
44:14:006:0	they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia , Lystra and Derbe , and the surrounding region ;
44:14:007:0	and there they continued to preach the gospel .
44:14:008:0	At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his feet , lame from his mother’s womb , who had never walked .
44:14:009:0	This man was listening to Paul as he spoke , who , when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that he had faith to be made well ,
44:14:010:0	said with a loud voice , “ Stand upright on your feet . ” And he leaped up and began to walk .
44:14:011:0	When the crowds saw what Paul had done , they raised their voice , saying in the Lycaonian language , “ The gods have become like men and have come down to us . ”
44:14:012:0	And they began calling Barnabas , Zeus , and Paul , Hermes , because he was the chief speaker .
44:14:013:0	The priest of Zeus , whose temple was just outside the city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds .
44:14:014:0	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it , they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd , crying out
44:14:015:0	and saying , “ Men , why are you doing these things ? We are also men of the same nature as you , and preach the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to a living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them .
44:14:016:0	In the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways ;
44:14:017:0	and yet He did not leave Himself without witness , in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , satisfying your hearts with food and gladness . ”
44:14:018:0	Even saying these things , with difficulty they restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them .
44:14:019:0	But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium , and having won over the crowds , they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city , supposing him to be dead .
44:14:020:0	But while the disciples stood around him , he got up and entered the city . The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe .
44:14:021:0	After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples , they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch ,
44:14:022:0	strengthening the souls of the disciples , encouraging them to continue in the faith , and saying , “ Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God . ”
44:14:023:0	When they had appointed elders for them in every church , having prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed .
44:14:024:0	They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia .
44:14:025:0	When they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
44:14:026:0	From there they sailed to Antioch , from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished .
44:14:027:0	When they had arrived and gathered the church together , they began to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44:14:028:0	And they spent a long time with the disciples .
