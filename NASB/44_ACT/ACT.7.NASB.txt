44:7:001:1	Stephen’s Defense
44:7:001:0	The high priest said , “ Are these things so ? ”
44:7:002:0	And he said , “ Hear me , brethren and fathers ! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
44:7:003:0	and said to him , ‘Leave your country and your relatives , and come into the land that I will show you . ’
44:7:004:0	Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . From there , after his father died , God had him move to this country in which you are now living .
44:7:005:0	But He gave him no inheritance in it , not even a foot of ground , and yet , even when he had no child , He promised that He would give it to him as a possession , and to his descendants after him .
44:7:006:0	But God spoke to this effect , that his descendants would be aliens in a foreign land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
44:7:007:0	‘And whatever nation to which they will be in bondage I Myself will judge , ’ said God , ‘and after that they will come out and serve Me in this place . ’
44:7:008:0	And He gave him the covenant of circumcision ; and so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circumcised him on the eighth day ; and Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs .
44:7:009:0	“ The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt . Yet God was with him ,
44:7:010:0	and rescued him from all his afflictions , and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household .
44:7:011:0	“ Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan , and great affliction with it , and our fathers could find no food .
44:7:012:0	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent our fathers there the first time .
44:7:013:0	On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and Joseph’s family was disclosed to Pharaoh .
44:7:014:0	Then Joseph sent word and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him , seventy-five persons in all .
44:7:015:0	And Jacob went down to Egypt and there he and our fathers died .
44:7:016:0	From there they were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44:7:017:0	“ But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham , the people increased and multiplied in Egypt ,
44:7:018:0	until there arose another king over Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph .
44:7:019:0	It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive .
44:7:020:0	It was at this time that Moses was born ; and he was lovely in the sight of God , and he was nurtured three months in his father’s home .
44:7:021:0	And after he had been set outside , Pharaoh’s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son .
44:7:022:0	Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians , and he was a man of power in words and deeds .
44:7:023:0	But when he was approaching the age of forty , it entered his mind to visit his brethren , the sons of Israel .
44:7:024:0	And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly , he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian .
44:7:025:0	And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him , but they did not understand .
44:7:026:0	On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together , and he tried to reconcile them in peace , saying , ‘Men , you are brethren , why do you injure one another ? ’
44:7:027:0	But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away , saying , ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us ?
44:7:028:0	You do not mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday , do you ? ’
44:7:029:0	At this remark , Moses fled and became an alien in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44:7:030:0	“ After forty years had passed , an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai , in the flame of a burning thorn bush .
44:7:031:0	When Moses saw it , he marveled at the sight ; and as he approached to look more closely , there came the voice of the Lord :
44:7:032:0	‘I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob . ’ Moses shook with fear and would not venture to look .
44:7:033:0	But the Lord said to him , ‘Take off the sandals from your feet , for the place on which you are standing is holy ground .
44:7:034:0	I have certainly seen the oppression of My people in Egypt and have heard their groans , and I have come down to rescue them ; come now , and I will send you to Egypt . ’
44:7:035:0	“ This Moses whom they disowned , saying , ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ’ is the one whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush .
44:7:036:0	This man led them out , performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years .
44:7:037:0	This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel , ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren . ’
44:7:038:0	This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai , and who was with our fathers ; and he received living oracles to pass on to you .
44:7:039:0	Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him , but repudiated him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt ,
44:7:040:0	saying to Aaron , ‘Make for us gods who will go before us ; for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we do not know what happened to him . ’
44:7:041:0	At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and were rejoicing in the works of their hands .
44:7:042:0	But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets , ‘It was not to Me that you offered victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness , was it , O house of Israel ?
44:7:043:0	You also took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god Rompha , the images which you made to worship . I also will remove you beyond Babylon . ’
44:7:044:0	“ Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness , just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen .
44:7:045:0	And having received it in their turn , our fathers brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations whom God drove out before our fathers , until the time of David .
44:7:046:0	David found favor in God’s sight , and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44:7:047:0	But it was Solomon who built a house for Him .
44:7:048:0	However , the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands ; as the prophet says :
44:7:049:0	‘Heaven is My throne , And earth is the footstool of My feet ; What kind of house will you build for Me ? ’ says the Lord , ‘Or what place is there for My repose ?
44:7:050:0	Was it not My hand which made all these things ? ’
44:7:051:0	“ You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit ; you are doing just as your fathers did .
44:7:052:0	Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute ? They killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One , whose betrayers and murderers you have now become ;
44:7:002:1	Stephen Put to Death
44:7:053:0	you who received the law as ordained by angels , and yet did not keep it . ”
44:7:054:0	Now when they heard this , they were cut to the quick , and they began gnashing their teeth at him .
44:7:055:0	But being full of the Holy Spirit , he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at the right hand of God ;
44:7:056:0	and he said , “ Behold , I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God . ”
44:7:057:0	But they cried out with a loud voice , and covered their ears and rushed at him with one impulse .
44:7:058:0	When they had driven him out of the city , they began stoning him ; and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44:7:059:0	They went on stoning Stephen as he called on the Lord and said , “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit ! ”
44:7:060:0	Then falling on his knees , he cried out with a loud voice , “ Lord , do not hold this sin against them ! ” Having said this , he fell asleep .
