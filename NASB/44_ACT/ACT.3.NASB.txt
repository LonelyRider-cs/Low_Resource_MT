44:3:001:1	Healing the Lame Beggar
44:3:001:0	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour , the hour of prayer .
44:3:002:0	And a man who had been lame from his mother’s womb was being carried along , whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful , in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple .
44:3:003:0	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple , he began asking to receive alms .
44:3:004:0	But Peter , along with John , fixed his gaze on him and said , “ Look at us ! ”
44:3:005:0	And he began to give them his attention , expecting to receive something from them .
44:3:006:0	But Peter said , “ I do not possess silver and gold , but what I do have I give to you : In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—walk ! ”
44:3:007:0	And seizing him by the right hand , he raised him up ; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened .
44:3:008:0	With a leap he stood upright and began to walk ; and he entered the temple with them , walking and leaping and praising God .
44:3:009:0	And all the people saw him walking and praising God ;
44:3:002:1	Peter’s Second Sermon
44:3:010:0	and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms , and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
44:3:011:0	While he was clinging to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon , full of amazement .
44:3:012:0	But when Peter saw this , he replied to the people , “ Men of Israel , why are you amazed at this , or why do you gaze at us , as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk ?
44:3:013:0	The God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified His servant Jesus , the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate , when he had decided to release Him .
44:3:014:0	But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you ,
44:3:015:0	but put to death the Prince of life , the one whom God raised from the dead , a fact to which we are witnesses .
44:3:016:0	And on the basis of faith in His name , it is the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know ; and the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all .
44:3:017:0	“ And now , brethren , I know that you acted in ignorance , just as your rulers did also .
44:3:018:0	But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets , that His Christ would suffer , He has thus fulfilled .
44:3:019:0	Therefore repent and return , so that your sins may be wiped away , in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord ;
44:3:020:0	and that He may send Jesus , the Christ appointed for you ,
44:3:021:0	whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time .
44:3:022:0	Moses said , ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren ; to Him you shall give heed to everything He says to you .
44:3:023:0	And it will be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people . ’
44:3:024:0	And likewise , all the prophets who have spoken , from Samuel and his successors onward , also announced these days .
44:3:025:0	It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers , saying to Abraham , ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed . ’
44:3:026:0	For you first , God raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways . ”
