44:13:001:1	First Missionary Journey
44:13:001:0	Now there were at Antioch , in the church that was there , prophets and teachers : Barnabas , and Simeon who was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44:13:002:0	While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , “ Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . ”
44:13:003:0	Then , when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
44:13:004:0	So , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44:13:005:0	When they reached Salamis , they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews ; and they also had John as their helper .
44:13:006:0	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos , they found a magician , a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus ,
44:13:007:0	who was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a man of intelligence . This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God .
44:13:008:0	But Elymas the magician ( for so his name is translated ) was opposing them , seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith .
44:13:009:0	But Saul , who was also known as Paul , filled with the Holy Spirit , fixed his gaze on him ,
44:13:010:0	and said , “ You who are full of all deceit and fraud , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord ?
44:13:011:0	Now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon you , and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time . ” And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him , and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand .
44:13:012:0	Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened , being amazed at the teaching of the Lord .
44:13:013:0	Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia ; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem .
44:13:014:0	But going on from Perga , they arrived at Pisidian Antioch , and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44:13:015:0	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them , saying , “ Brethren , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , say it . ”
44:13:016:0	Paul stood up , and motioning with his hand said , “ Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen :
44:13:017:0	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt , and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it .
44:13:018:0	For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness .
44:13:019:0	When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , He distributed their land as an inheritance—all of which took about four hundred and fifty years .
44:13:020:0	After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet .
44:13:021:0	Then they asked for a king , and God gave them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44:13:022:0	After He had removed him , He raised up David to be their king , concerning whom He also testified and said , ‘I have found David the son of Jesse , a man after My heart , who will do all My will . ’
44:13:023:0	From the descendants of this man , according to promise , God has brought to Israel a Savior , Jesus ,
44:13:024:0	after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44:13:025:0	And while John was completing his course , he kept saying , ‘What do you suppose that I am ? I am not He . But behold , one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . ’
44:13:026:0	“ Brethren , sons of Abraham’s family , and those among you who fear God , to us the message of this salvation has been sent .
44:13:027:0	For those who live in Jerusalem , and their rulers , recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled these by condemning Him .
44:13:028:0	And though they found no ground for putting Him to death , they asked Pilate that He be executed .
44:13:029:0	When they had carried out all that was written concerning Him , they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb .
44:13:030:0	But God raised Him from the dead ;
44:13:031:0	and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem , the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people .
44:13:032:0	And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers ,
44:13:033:0	that God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that He raised up Jesus , as it is also written in the second Psalm , ‘You are My Son ; today I have begotten You . ’
44:13:034:0	As for the fact that He raised Him up from the dead , no longer to return to decay , He has spoken in this way : ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . ’
44:13:035:0	Therefore He also says in another Psalm , ‘You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay . ’
44:13:036:0	For David , after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation , fell asleep , and was laid among his fathers and underwent decay ;
44:13:037:0	but He whom God raised did not undergo decay .
44:13:038:0	Therefore let it be known to you , brethren , that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you ,
44:13:039:0	and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things , from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses .
44:13:040:0	Therefore take heed , so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon you :
44:13:041:0	‘Behold , you scoffers , and marvel , and perish ; For I am accomplishing a work in your days , A work which you will never believe , though someone should describe it to you . ’ ”
44:13:042:0	As Paul and Barnabas were going out , the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath .
44:13:002:1	Paul Turns to the Gentiles
44:13:043:0	Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up , many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas , who , speaking to them , were urging them to continue in the grace of God .
44:13:044:0	The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of the Lord .
44:13:045:0	But when the Jews saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul , and were blaspheming .
44:13:046:0	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said , “ It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first ; since you repudiate it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , behold , we are turning to the Gentiles .
44:13:047:0	For so the Lord has commanded us , ‘I have placed You as a light for the Gentiles , That You may bring salvation to the end of the earth . ’ ”
44:13:048:0	When the Gentiles heard this , they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord ; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed .
44:13:049:0	And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region .
44:13:050:0	But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city , and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and drove them out of their district .
44:13:051:0	But they shook off the dust of their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium .
44:13:052:0	And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
