44:21:001:1	Paul Sails from Miletus
44:21:001:0	When we had parted from them and had set sail , we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara ;
44:21:002:0	and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , we went aboard and set sail .
44:21:003:0	When we came in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left , we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre ; for there the ship was to unload its cargo .
44:21:004:0	After looking up the disciples , we stayed there seven days ; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem .
44:21:005:0	When our days there were ended , we left and started on our journey , while they all , with wives and children , escorted us until we were out of the city . After kneeling down on the beach and praying , we said farewell to one another .
44:21:006:0	Then we went on board the ship , and they returned home again .
44:21:007:0	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais , and after greeting the brethren , we stayed with them for a day .
44:21:008:0	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea , and entering the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , we stayed with him .
44:21:009:0	Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses .
44:21:010:0	As we were staying there for some days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44:21:011:0	And coming to us , he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands , and said , “ This is what the Holy Spirit says : ‘In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ’ ”
44:21:012:0	When we had heard this , we as well as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44:21:013:0	Then Paul answered , “ What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be bound , but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . ”
44:21:002:1	Paul at Jerusalem
44:21:014:0	And since he would not be persuaded , we fell silent , remarking , “ The will of the Lord be done ! ”
44:21:015:0	After these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem .
44:21:016:0	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us , taking us to Mnason of Cyprus , a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge .
44:21:017:0	After we arrived in Jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
44:21:018:0	And the following day Paul went in with us to James , and all the elders were present .
44:21:019:0	After he had greeted them , he began to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44:21:020:0	And when they heard it they began glorifying God ; and they said to him , “ You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed , and they are all zealous for the Law ;
44:21:021:0	and they have been told about you , that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs .
44:21:022:0	What , then , is to be done ? They will certainly hear that you have come .
44:21:023:0	Therefore do this that we tell you . We have four men who are under a vow ;
44:21:024:0	take them and purify yourself along with them , and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads ; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you , but that you yourself also walk orderly , keeping the Law .
44:21:025:0	But concerning the Gentiles who have believed , we wrote , having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication . ”
44:21:003:1	Paul Seized in the Temple
44:21:026:0	Then Paul took the men , and the next day , purifying himself along with them , went into the temple giving notice of the completion of the days of purification , until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them .
44:21:027:0	When the seven days were almost over , the Jews from Asia , upon seeing him in the temple , began to stir up all the crowd and laid hands on him ,
44:21:028:0	crying out , “ Men of Israel , come to our aid ! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people and the Law and this place ; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place . ”
44:21:029:0	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
44:21:030:0	Then all the city was provoked , and the people rushed together , and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple , and immediately the doors were shut .
44:21:031:0	While they were seeking to kill him , a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion .
44:21:032:0	At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them ; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44:21:033:0	Then the commander came up and took hold of him , and ordered him to be bound with two chains ; and he began asking who he was and what he had done .
44:21:034:0	But among the crowd some were shouting one thing and some another , and when he could not find out the facts because of the uproar , he ordered him to be brought into the barracks .
44:21:035:0	When he got to the stairs , he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob ;
44:21:036:0	for the multitude of the people kept following them , shouting , “ Away with him ! ”
44:21:037:0	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he said to the commander , “ May I say something to you ? ” And he *said , “ Do you know Greek ?
44:21:038:0	Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness ? ”
44:21:039:0	But Paul said , “ I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no insignificant city ; and I beg you , allow me to speak to the people . ”
44:21:040:0	When he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , motioned to the people with his hand ; and when there was a great hush , he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect , saying ,
