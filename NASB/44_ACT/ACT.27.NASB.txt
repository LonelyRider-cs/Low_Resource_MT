44:27:001:1	Paul Is Sent to Rome
44:27:001:0	When it was decided that we would sail for Italy , they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius .
44:27:002:0	And embarking in an Adramyttian ship , which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia , we put out to sea accompanied by Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica .
44:27:003:0	The next day we put in at Sidon ; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care .
44:27:004:0	From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary .
44:27:005:0	When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we landed at Myra in Lycia .
44:27:006:0	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy , and he put us aboard it .
44:27:007:0	When we had sailed slowly for a good many days , and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus , since the wind did not permit us to go farther , we sailed under the shelter of Crete , off Salmone ;
44:27:008:0	and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a place called Fair Havens , near which was the city of Lasea .
44:27:009:0	When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous , since even the fast was already over , Paul began to admonish them ,
44:27:010:0	and said to them , “ Men , I perceive that the voyage will certainly be with damage and great loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . ”
44:27:011:0	But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul .
44:27:012:0	Because the harbor was not suitable for wintering , the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there , if somehow they could reach Phoenix , a harbor of Crete , facing southwest and northwest , and spend the winter there .
44:27:002:1	Shipwreck
44:27:013:0	When a moderate south wind came up , supposing that they had attained their purpose , they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete , close inshore .
44:27:014:0	But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind , called Euraquilo ;
44:27:015:0	and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind , we gave way to it and let ourselves be driven along .
44:27:016:0	Running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda , we were scarcely able to get the ship’s boat under control .
44:27:017:0	After they had hoisted it up , they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship ; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis , they let down the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along .
44:27:018:0	The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed , they began to jettison the cargo ;
44:27:019:0	and on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands .
44:27:020:0	Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days , and no small storm was assailing us , from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned .
44:27:021:0	When they had gone a long time without food , then Paul stood up in their midst and said , “ Men , you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss .
44:27:022:0	Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage , for there will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
44:27:023:0	For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me ,
44:27:024:0	saying , ‘Do not be afraid , Paul ; you must stand before Caesar ; and behold , God has granted you all those who are sailing with you . ’
44:27:025:0	Therefore , keep up your courage , men , for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told .
44:27:026:0	But we must run aground on a certain island . ”
44:27:027:0	But when the fourteenth night came , as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors began to surmise that they were approaching some land .
44:27:028:0	They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms ; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms .
44:27:029:0	Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks , they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak .
44:27:030:0	But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the ship’s boat into the sea , on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow ,
44:27:031:0	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , “ Unless these men remain in the ship , you yourselves cannot be saved . ”
44:27:032:0	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it fall away .
44:27:033:0	Until the day was about to dawn , Paul was encouraging them all to take some food , saying , “ Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating , having taken nothing .
44:27:034:0	Therefore I encourage you to take some food , for this is for your preservation , for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish . ”
44:27:035:0	Having said this , he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all , and he broke it and began to eat .
44:27:036:0	All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food .
44:27:037:0	All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons .
44:27:038:0	When they had eaten enough , they began to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea .
44:27:039:0	When day came , they could not recognize the land ; but they did observe a bay with a beach , and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could .
44:27:040:0	And casting off the anchors , they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders ; and hoisting the foresail to the wind , they were heading for the beach .
44:27:041:0	But striking a reef where two seas met , they ran the vessel aground ; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable , but the stern began to be broken up by the force of the waves .
44:27:042:0	The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners , so that none of them would swim away and escape ;
44:27:043:0	but the centurion , wanting to bring Paul safely through , kept them from their intention , and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land ,
44:27:044:0	and the rest should follow , some on planks , and others on various things from the ship . And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land .
