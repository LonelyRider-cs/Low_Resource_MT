44:12:001:1	Peter’s Arrest and Deliverance
44:12:001:0	Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to mistreat them .
44:12:002:0	And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword .
44:12:003:0	When he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to arrest Peter also . Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread .
44:12:004:0	When he had seized him , he put him in prison , delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him , intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people .
44:12:005:0	So Peter was kept in the prison , but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God .
44:12:006:0	On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains , and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison .
44:12:007:0	And behold , an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared and a light shone in the cell ; and he struck Peter’s side and woke him up , saying , “ Get up quickly . ” And his chains fell off his hands .
44:12:008:0	And the angel said to him , “ Gird yourself and put on your sandals . ” And he did so . And he *said to him , “ Wrap your cloak around you and follow me . ”
44:12:009:0	And he went out and continued to follow , and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44:12:010:0	When they had passed the first and second guard , they came to the iron gate that leads into the city , which opened for them by itself ; and they went out and went along one street , and immediately the angel departed from him .
44:12:011:0	When Peter came to himself , he said , “ Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting . ”
44:12:012:0	And when he realized this , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John who was also called Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
44:12:013:0	When he knocked at the door of the gate , a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer .
44:12:014:0	When she recognized Peter’s voice , because of her joy she did not open the gate , but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate .
44:12:015:0	They said to her , “ You are out of your mind ! ” But she kept insisting that it was so . They kept saying , “ It is his angel . ”
44:12:016:0	But Peter continued knocking ; and when they had opened the door , they saw him and were amazed .
44:12:017:0	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent , he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison . And he said , “ Report these things to James and the brethren . ” Then he left and went to another place .
44:12:018:0	Now when day came , there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter .
44:12:002:1	Death of Herod
44:12:019:0	When Herod had searched for him and had not found him , he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution . Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there .
44:12:020:0	Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon ; and with one accord they came to him , and having won over Blastus the king’s chamberlain , they were asking for peace , because their country was fed by the king’s country .
44:12:021:0	On an appointed day Herod , having put on his royal apparel , took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them .
44:12:022:0	The people kept crying out , “ The voice of a god and not of a man ! ”
44:12:023:0	And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory , and he was eaten by worms and died .
44:12:024:0	But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied .
44:12:025:0	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission , taking along with them John , who was also called Mark .
