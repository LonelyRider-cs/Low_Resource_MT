24:3:001:1	The Polluted Land
24:3:001:0	God says , “ If a husband divorces his wifeAnd she goes from himAnd belongs to another man , Will he still return to her ? Will not that land be completely polluted ? But you are a harlot with many lovers ; Yet you turn to Me , ” declares the Lord .
24:3:002:0	“ Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see ; Where have you not been violated ? By the roads you have sat for themLike an Arab in the desert , And you have polluted a landWith your harlotry and with your wickedness .
24:3:003:0	Therefore the showers have been withheld , And there has been no spring rain . Yet you had a harlot’s forehead ; You refused to be ashamed .
24:3:004:0	Have you not just now called to Me , ‘My Father , You are the friend of my youth ?
24:3:002:1	Faithless Israel
24:3:005:0	Will He be angry forever ? Will He be indignant to the end ? ’Behold , you have spokenAnd have done evil things , And you have had your way . ”
24:3:006:0	Then the Lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king , “ Have you seen what faithless Israel did ? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree , and she was a harlot there .
24:3:007:0	I thought , ‘After she has done all these things she will return to Me’ ; but she did not return , and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
24:3:008:0	And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel , I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce , yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear ; but she went and was a harlot also .
24:3:009:0	Because of the lightness of her harlotry , she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees .
24:3:003:1	God Invites Repentance
24:3:010:0	Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart , but rather in deception , ” declares the Lord .
24:3:011:0	And the Lord said to me , “ Faithless Israel has proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah .
24:3:012:0	Go and proclaim these words toward the north and say , ‘Return , faithless Israel , ’ declares the Lord ; ‘I will not look upon you in anger . For I am gracious , ’ declares the Lord ; ‘I will not be angry forever .
24:3:013:0	Only acknowledge your iniquity , That you have transgressed against the Lord your GodAnd have scattered your favors to the strangers under every green tree , And you have not obeyed My voice , ’ declares the Lord .
24:3:014:0	‘Return , O faithless sons , ’ declares the Lord ; ‘For I am a master to you , And I will take you one from a city and two from a family , And I will bring you to Zion . ’
24:3:015:0	“ Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart , who will feed you on knowledge and understanding .
24:3:016:0	It shall be in those days when you are multiplied and increased in the land , ” declares the Lord , “ they will no longer say , ‘The ark of the covenant of the Lord . ’ And it will not come to mind , nor will they remember it , nor will they miss it , nor will it be made again .
24:3:017:0	At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of the Lord , ’ and all the nations will be gathered to it , to Jerusalem , for the name of the Lord ; nor will they walk anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart .
24:3:018:0	In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel , and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance .
24:3:019:0	“ Then I said , ‘How I would set you among My sonsAnd give you a pleasant land , The most beautiful inheritance of the nations ! ’And I said , ‘You shall call Me , My Father , And not turn away from following Me . ’
24:3:020:0	Surely , as a woman treacherously departs from her lover , So you have dealt treacherously with Me , O house of Israel , ” declares the Lord .
24:3:021:0	A voice is heard on the bare heights , The weeping and the supplications of the sons of Israel ; Because they have perverted their way , They have forgotten the Lord their God .
24:3:022:0	“ Return , O faithless sons , I will heal your faithlessness . ” “ Behold , we come to You ; For You are the Lord our God .
24:3:023:0	Surely , the hills are a deception , A tumult on the mountains . Surely in the Lord our GodIs the salvation of Israel .
24:3:024:0	“ But the shameful thing has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth , their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
24:3:025:0	Let us lie down in our shame , and let our humiliation cover us ; for we have sinned against the Lord our God , we and our fathers , from our youth even to this day . And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God . ”
