24:18:001:1	The Potter and the Clay
24:18:001:0	The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying ,
24:18:002:0	“ Arise and go down to the potter’s house , and there I will announce My words to you . ”
24:18:003:0	Then I went down to the potter’s house , and there he was , making something on the wheel .
24:18:004:0	But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter ; so he remade it into another vessel , as it pleased the potter to make .
24:18:005:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
24:18:006:0	“ Can I not , O house of Israel , deal with you as this potter does ? ” declares the Lord . “ Behold , like the clay in the potter’s hand , so are you in My hand , O house of Israel .
24:18:007:0	At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot , to pull down , or to destroy it ;
24:18:008:0	if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil , I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it .
24:18:009:0	Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant it ;
24:18:010:0	if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice , then I will think better of the good with which I had promised to bless it .
24:18:011:0	So now then , speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you . Oh turn back , each of you from his evil way , and reform your ways and your deeds . ” ’
24:18:012:0	But they will say , ‘It’s hopeless ! For we are going to follow our own plans , and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart . ’
24:18:013:0	“ Therefore thus says the Lord , ‘Ask now among the nations , Who ever heard the like of this ? The virgin of IsraelHas done a most appalling thing .
24:18:014:0	Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the open country ? Or is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever snatched away ?
24:18:015:0	For My people have forgotten Me , They burn incense to worthless godsAnd they have stumbled from their ways , From the ancient paths , To walk in bypaths , Not on a highway ,
24:18:016:0	To make their land a desolation , An object of perpetual hissing ; Everyone who passes by it will be astonishedAnd shake his head .
24:18:017:0	Like an east wind I will scatter themBefore the enemy ; I will show them My back and not My faceIn the day of their calamity . ’ ”
24:18:018:0	Then they said , “ Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah . Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest , nor counsel to the sage , nor the divine word to the prophet ! Come on and let us strike at him with our tongue , and let us give no heed to any of his words . ”
24:18:019:0	Do give heed to me , O Lord , And listen to what my opponents are saying !
24:18:020:0	Should good be repaid with evil ? For they have dug a pit for me . Remember how I stood before YouTo speak good on their behalf , So as to turn away Your wrath from them .
24:18:021:0	Therefore , give their children over to famineAnd deliver them up to the power of the sword ; And let their wives become childless and widowed . Let their men also be smitten to death , Their young men struck down by the sword in battle .
24:18:022:0	May an outcry be heard from their houses , When You suddenly bring raiders upon them ; For they have dug a pit to capture meAnd hidden snares for my feet .
24:18:023:0	Yet You , O Lord , knowAll their deadly designs against me ; Do not forgive their iniquityOr blot out their sin from Your sight . But may they be overthrown before You ; Deal with them in the time of Your anger !
