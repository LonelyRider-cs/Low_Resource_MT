24:17:001:1	The Deceitful Heart
24:17:001:0	The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus ; With a diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heartAnd on the horns of their altars ,
24:17:002:0	As they remember their children , So they remember their altars and their AsherimBy green trees on the high hills .
24:17:003:0	O mountain of Mine in the countryside , I will give over your wealth and all your treasures for booty , Your high places for sin throughout your borders .
24:17:004:0	And you will , even of yourself , let go of your inheritanceThat I gave you ; And I will make you serve your enemiesIn the land which you do not know ; For you have kindled a fire in My angerWhich will burn forever .
24:17:005:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Cursed is the man who trusts in mankindAnd makes flesh his strength , And whose heart turns away from the Lord .
24:17:006:0	For he will be like a bush in the desertAnd will not see when prosperity comes , But will live in stony wastes in the wilderness , A land of salt without inhabitant .
24:17:007:0	Blessed is the man who trusts in the LordAnd whose trust is the Lord .
24:17:008:0	For he will be like a tree planted by the water , That extends its roots by a streamAnd will not fear when the heat comes ; But its leaves will be green , And it will not be anxious in a year of droughtNor cease to yield fruit .
24:17:009:0	“ The heart is more deceitful than all elseAnd is desperately sick ; Who can understand it ?
24:17:010:0	I , the Lord , search the heart , I test the mind , Even to give to each man according to his ways , According to the results of his deeds .
24:17:011:0	As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid , So is he who makes a fortune , but unjustly ; In the midst of his days it will forsake him , And in the end he will be a fool . ”
24:17:012:0	A glorious throne on high from the beginningIs the place of our sanctuary .
24:17:013:0	O Lord , the hope of Israel , All who forsake You will be put to shame . Those who turn away on earth will be written down , Because they have forsaken the fountain of living water , even the Lord .
24:17:014:0	Heal me , O Lord , and I will be healed ; Save me and I will be saved , For You are my praise .
24:17:015:0	Look , they keep saying to me , “ Where is the word of the Lord ? Let it come now ! ”
24:17:016:0	But as for me , I have not hurried away from being a shepherd after You , Nor have I longed for the woeful day ; You Yourself know that the utterance of my lipsWas in Your presence .
24:17:017:0	Do not be a terror to me ; You are my refuge in the day of disaster .
24:17:002:1	The Sabbath Must Be Kept
24:17:018:0	Let those who persecute me be put to shame , but as for me , let me not be put to shame ; Let them be dismayed , but let me not be dismayed . Bring on them a day of disaster , And crush them with twofold destruction !
24:17:019:0	Thus the Lord said to me , “ Go and stand in the public gate , through which the kings of Judah come in and go out , as well as in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
24:17:020:0	and say to them , ‘Listen to the word of the Lord , kings of Judah , and all Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem who come in through these gates :
24:17:021:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Take heed for yourselves , and do not carry any load on the sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem .
24:17:022:0	You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the sabbath day nor do any work , but keep the sabbath day holy , as I commanded your forefathers .
24:17:023:0	Yet they did not listen or incline their ears , but stiffened their necks in order not to listen or take correction .
24:17:024:0	“ But it will come about , if you listen attentively to Me , ” declares the Lord , “ to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the sabbath day , but to keep the sabbath day holy by doing no work on it ,
24:17:025:0	then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they and their princes , the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and this city will be inhabited forever .
24:17:026:0	They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem , from the land of Benjamin , from the lowland , from the hill country and from the Negev , bringing burnt offerings , sacrifices , grain offerings and incense , and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the Lord .
24:17:027:0	But if you do not listen to Me to keep the sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day , then I will kindle a fire in its gates and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched . ” ’ ”
