24:13:001:1	The Ruined Waistband
24:13:001:0	Thus the Lord said to me , “ Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist , but do not put it in water . ”
24:13:002:0	So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the Lord and put it around my waist .
24:13:003:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time , saying ,
24:13:004:0	“ Take the waistband that you have bought , which is around your waist , and arise , go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock . ”
24:13:005:0	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates , as the Lord had commanded me .
24:13:006:0	After many days the Lord said to me , “ Arise , go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there . ”
24:13:007:0	Then I went to the Euphrates and dug , and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it ; and lo , the waistband was ruined , it was totally worthless .
24:13:008:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
24:13:009:0	“ Thus says the Lord , ‘Just so will I destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem .
24:13:010:0	This wicked people , who refuse to listen to My words , who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them , let them be just like this waistband which is totally worthless .
24:13:002:1	Captivity Threatened
24:13:011:0	For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man , so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me , ’ declares the Lord , ‘that they might be for Me a people , for renown , for praise and for glory ; but they did not listen . ’
24:13:012:0	“ Therefore you are to speak this word to them , ‘Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , “ Every jug is to be filled with wine . ” ’ And when they say to you , ‘Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine ? ’
24:13:013:0	then say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Behold I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings that sit for David on his throne , the priests , the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness !
24:13:014:0	I will dash them against each other , both the fathers and the sons together , ” declares the Lord . “ I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion so as not to destroy them . ” ’ ”
24:13:015:0	Listen and give heed , do not be haughty , For the Lord has spoken .
24:13:016:0	Give glory to the Lord your God , Before He brings darknessAnd before your feet stumbleOn the dusky mountains , And while you are hoping for lightHe makes it into deep darkness , And turns it into gloom .
24:13:017:0	But if you will not listen to it , My soul will sob in secret for such pride ; And my eyes will bitterly weepAnd flow down with tears , Because the flock of the Lord has been taken captive .
24:13:018:0	Say to the king and the queen mother , “ Take a lowly seat , For your beautiful crownHas come down from your head . ”
24:13:019:0	The cities of the Negev have been locked up , And there is no one to open them ; All Judah has been carried into exile , Wholly carried into exile .
24:13:020:0	“ Lift up your eyes and seeThose coming from the north . Where is the flock that was given you , Your beautiful sheep ?
24:13:021:0	What will you say when He appoints over you—And you yourself had taught them—Former companions to be head over you ? Will not pangs take hold of youLike a woman in childbirth ?
24:13:022:0	If you say in your heart , ‘Why have these things happened to me ? ’Because of the magnitude of your iniquityYour skirts have been removedAnd your heels have been exposed .
24:13:023:0	Can the Ethiopian change his skinOr the leopard his spots ? Then you also can do goodWho are accustomed to doing evil .
24:13:024:0	Therefore I will scatter them like drifting strawTo the desert wind .
24:13:025:0	This is your lot , the portion measured to youFrom Me , ” declares the Lord , “ Because you have forgotten MeAnd trusted in falsehood .
24:13:026:0	So I Myself have also stripped your skirts off over your face , That your shame may be seen .
24:13:027:0	As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings , The lewdness of your prostitutionOn the hills in the field , I have seen your abominations . Woe to you , O Jerusalem ! How long will you remain unclean ? ”
