24:25:001:1	Prophecy of the Captivity
24:25:001:0	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah ( that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) ,
24:25:002:0	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying ,
24:25:003:0	“ From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , even to this day , these twenty-three years the word of the Lord has come to me , and I have spoken to you again and again , but you have not listened .
24:25:004:0	And the Lord has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again , but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear ,
24:25:005:0	saying , ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds , and dwell on the land which the Lord has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever ;
24:25:006:0	and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them , and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands , and I will do you no harm . ’
24:25:007:0	Yet you have not listened to Me , ” declares the Lord , “ in order that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm .
24:25:008:0	“ Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Because you have not obeyed My words ,
24:25:009:0	behold , I will send and take all the families of the north , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , My servant , and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about ; and I will utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing , and an everlasting desolation .
24:25:010:0	Moreover , I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp .
24:25:002:1	Babylon Will Be Judged
24:25:011:0	This whole land will be a desolation and a horror , and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
24:25:012:0	‘Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation , ’ declares the Lord , ‘for their iniquity , and the land of the Chaldeans ; and I will make it an everlasting desolation .
24:25:013:0	I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it , all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations .
24:25:014:0	( For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them , even them ; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands . ) ’ ”
24:25:015:0	For thus the Lord , the God of Israel , says to me , “ Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it .
24:25:016:0	They will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them . ”
24:25:017:0	Then I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it :
24:25:018:0	Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and its kings and its princes , to make them a ruin , a horror , a hissing and a curse , as it is this day ;
24:25:019:0	Pharaoh king of Egypt , his servants , his princes and all his people ;
24:25:020:0	and all the foreign people , all the kings of the land of Uz , all the kings of the land of the Philistines ( even Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron and the remnant of Ashdod ) ;
24:25:021:0	Edom , Moab and the sons of Ammon ;
24:25:022:0	and all the kings of Tyre , all the kings of Sidon and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea ;
24:25:023:0	and Dedan , Tema , Buz and all who cut the corners of their hair ;
24:25:024:0	and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who dwell in the desert ;
24:25:025:0	and all the kings of Zimri , all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media ;
24:25:026:0	and all the kings of the north , near and far , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground , and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
24:25:027:0	“ You shall say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ Drink , be drunk , vomit , fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you . ” ’
24:25:028:0	And it will be , if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink , then you will say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts : “ You shall surely drink !
24:25:029:0	For behold , I am beginning to work calamity in this city which is called by My name , and shall you be completely free from punishment ? You will not be free from punishment ; for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth , ” declares the Lord of hosts . ’
24:25:030:0	“ Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words , and you shall say to them , ‘The Lord will roar from on highAnd utter His voice from His holy habitation ; He will roar mightily against His fold . He will shout like those who tread the grapes , Against all the inhabitants of the earth .
24:25:031:0	A clamor has come to the end of the earth , Because the Lord has a controversy with the nations . He is entering into judgment with all flesh ; As for the wicked , He has given them to the sword , ’ declares the Lord . ”
24:25:032:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Behold , evil is going forthFrom nation to nation , And a great storm is being stirred upFrom the remotest parts of the earth .
24:25:033:0	“ Those slain by the Lord on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other . They will not be lamented , gathered or buried ; they will be like dung on the face of the ground .
24:25:034:0	Wail , you shepherds , and cry ; And wallow in ashes , you masters of the flock ; For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come , And you will fall like a choice vessel .
24:25:035:0	Flight will perish from the shepherds , And escape from the masters of the flock .
24:25:036:0	Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds , And the wailing of the masters of the flock ! For the Lord is destroying their pasture ,
24:25:037:0	And the peaceful folds are made silentBecause of the fierce anger of the Lord .
24:25:038:0	He has left His hiding place like the lion ; For their land has become a horrorBecause of the fierceness of the oppressing swordAnd because of His fierce anger . ”
