24:24:001:1	Baskets of Figs and the Returnees
24:24:001:0	After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon , the Lord showed me : behold , two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord !
24:24:002:0	One basket had very good figs , like first-ripe figs , and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness .
24:24:003:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” And I said , “ Figs , the good figs , very good ; and the bad figs , very bad , which cannot be eaten due to rottenness . ”
24:24:004:0	Then the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
24:24:005:0	“ Thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘Like these good figs , so I will regard as good the captives of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans .
24:24:006:0	For I will set My eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land ; and I will build them up and not overthrow them , and I will plant them and not pluck them up .
24:24:007:0	I will give them a heart to know Me , for I am the Lord ; and they will be My people , and I will be their God , for they will return to Me with their whole heart .
24:24:008:0	‘But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness—indeed , thus says the Lord—so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials , and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt .
24:24:009:0	I will make them a terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of the earth , as a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse in all places where I will scatter them .
24:24:010:0	I will send the sword , the famine and the pestilence upon them until they are destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers . ’ ”
