24:50:001:1	Prophecy against Babylon
24:50:001:0	The word which the Lord spoke concerning Babylon , the land of the Chaldeans , through Jeremiah the prophet :
24:50:002:0	“ Declare and proclaim among the nations . Proclaim it and lift up a standard . Do not conceal it but say , ‘Babylon has been captured , Bel has been put to shame , Marduk has been shattered ; Her images have been put to shame , her idols have been shattered . ’
24:50:003:0	For a nation has come up against her out of the north ; it will make her land an object of horror , and there will be no inhabitant in it . Both man and beast have wandered off , they have gone away !
24:50:004:0	“ In those days and at that time , ” declares the Lord , “ the sons of Israel will come , both they and the sons of Judah as well ; they will go along weeping as they go , and it will be the Lord their God they will seek .
24:50:005:0	They will ask for the way to Zion , turning their faces in its direction ; they will come that they may join themselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten .
24:50:006:0	“ My people have become lost sheep ; Their shepherds have led them astray . They have made them turn aside on the mountains ; They have gone along from mountain to hillAnd have forgotten their resting place .
24:50:007:0	All who came upon them have devoured them ; And their adversaries have said , ‘We are not guilty , Inasmuch as they have sinned against the Lord who is the habitation of righteousness , Even the Lord , the hope of their fathers . ’
24:50:008:0	“ Wander away from the midst of BabylonAnd go forth from the land of the Chaldeans ; Be also like male goats at the head of the flock .
24:50:009:0	For behold , I am going to arouse and bring up against BabylonA horde of great nations from the land of the north , And they will draw up their battle lines against her ; From there she will be taken captive . Their arrows will be like an expert warriorWho does not return empty-handed .
24:50:010:0	Chaldea will become plunder ; All who plunder her will have enough , ” declares the Lord .
24:50:011:0	“ Because you are glad , because you are jubilant , O you who pillage My heritage , Because you skip about like a threshing heiferAnd neigh like stallions ,
24:50:012:0	Your mother will be greatly ashamed , She who gave you birth will be humiliated . Behold , she will be the least of the nations , A wilderness , a parched land and a desert .
24:50:013:0	Because of the indignation of the Lord she will not be inhabited , But she will be completely desolate ; Everyone who passes by Babylon will be horrifiedAnd will hiss because of all her wounds .
24:50:014:0	Draw up your battle lines against Babylon on every side , All you who bend the bow ; Shoot at her , do not be sparing with your arrows , For she has sinned against the Lord .
24:50:015:0	Raise your battle cry against her on every side ! She has given herself up , her pillars have fallen , Her walls have been torn down . For this is the vengeance of the Lord : Take vengeance on her ; As she has done to others , so do to her .
24:50:016:0	Cut off the sower from BabylonAnd the one who wields the sickle at the time of harvest ; From before the sword of the oppressorThey will each turn back to his own peopleAnd they will each flee to his own land .
24:50:017:0	“ Israel is a scattered flock , the lions have driven them away . The first one who devoured him was the king of Assyria , and this last one who has broken his bones is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon .
24:50:018:0	Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : ‘Behold , I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land , just as I punished the king of Assyria .
24:50:019:0	And I will bring Israel back to his pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan , and his desire will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead .
24:50:020:0	In those days and at that time , ’ declares the Lord , ‘search will be made for the iniquity of Israel , but there will be none ; and for the sins of Judah , but they will not be found ; for I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant . ’
24:50:021:0	“ Against the land of Merathaim , go up against it , And against the inhabitants of Pekod . Slay and utterly destroy them , ” declares the Lord , “ And do according to all that I have commanded you .
24:50:022:0	The noise of battle is in the land , And great destruction .
24:50:023:0	How the hammer of the whole earthHas been cut off and broken ! How Babylon has becomeAn object of horror among the nations !
24:50:024:0	I set a snare for you and you were also caught , O Babylon , While you yourself were not aware ; You have been found and also seizedBecause you have engaged in conflict with the Lord . ”
24:50:025:0	The Lord has opened His armoryAnd has brought forth the weapons of His indignation , For it is a work of the Lord God of hostsIn the land of the Chaldeans .
24:50:026:0	Come to her from the farthest border ; Open up her barns , Pile her up like heapsAnd utterly destroy her , Let nothing be left to her .
24:50:027:0	Put all her young bulls to the sword ; Let them go down to the slaughter ! Woe be upon them , for their day has come , The time of their punishment .
24:50:028:0	There is a sound of fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon , To declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , Vengeance for His temple .
24:50:029:0	“ Summon many against Babylon , All those who bend the bow : Encamp against her on every side , Let there be no escape . Repay her according to her work ; According to all that she has done , so do to her ; For she has become arrogant against the Lord , Against the Holy One of Israel .
24:50:030:0	Therefore her young men will fall in her streets , And all her men of war will be silenced in that day , ” declares the Lord .
24:50:031:0	“ Behold , I am against you , O arrogant one , ” Declares the Lord God of hosts , “ For your day has come , The time when I will punish you .
24:50:032:0	The arrogant one will stumble and fallWith no one to raise him up ; And I will set fire to his citiesAnd it will devour all his environs . ”
24:50:033:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ The sons of Israel are oppressed , And the sons of Judah as well ; And all who took them captive have held them fast , They have refused to let them go .
24:50:034:0	Their Redeemer is strong , the Lord of hosts is His name ; He will vigorously plead their caseSo that He may bring rest to the earth , But turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon .
24:50:035:0	A sword against the Chaldeans , ” declares the Lord , “ And against the inhabitants of BabylonAnd against her officials and her wise men !
24:50:036:0	A sword against the oracle priests , and they will become fools ! A sword against her mighty men , and they will be shattered !
24:50:037:0	A sword against their horses and against their chariotsAnd against all the foreigners who are in the midst of her , And they will become women ! A sword against her treasures , and they will be plundered !
24:50:038:0	A drought on her waters , and they will be dried up ! For it is a land of idols , And they are mad over fearsome idols .
24:50:039:0	“ Therefore the desert creatures will live there along with the jackals ; The ostriches also will live in it , And it will never again be inhabitedOr dwelt in from generation to generation .
24:50:040:0	As when God overthrew SodomAnd Gomorrah with its neighbors , ” declares the Lord , “ No man will live there , Nor will any son of man reside in it .
24:50:041:0	“ Behold , a people is coming from the north , And a great nation and many kingsWill be aroused from the remote parts of the earth .
24:50:042:0	They seize their bow and javelin ; They are cruel and have no mercy . Their voice roars like the sea ; And they ride on horses , Marshalled like a man for the battleAgainst you , O daughter of Babylon .
24:50:043:0	The king of Babylon has heard the report about them , And his hands hang limp ; Distress has gripped him , Agony like a woman in childbirth .
24:50:044:0	“ Behold , one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture ; for in an instant I will make them run away from it , and whoever is chosen I will appoint over it . For who is like Me , and who will summon Me into court ? And who then is the shepherd who can stand before Me ? ”
24:50:045:0	Therefore hear the plan of the Lord which He has planned against Babylon , and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely they will drag them off , even the little ones of the flock ; surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them .
24:50:046:0	At the shout , “ Babylon has been seized ! ” the earth is shaken , and an outcry is heard among the nations .
