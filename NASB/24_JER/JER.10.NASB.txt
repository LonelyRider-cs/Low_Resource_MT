24:10:001:1	A Satire on Idolatry
24:10:001:0	Hear the word which the Lord speaks to you , O house of Israel .
24:10:002:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Do not learn the way of the nations , And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavensAlthough the nations are terrified by them ;
24:10:003:0	For the customs of the peoples are delusion ; Because it is wood cut from the forest , The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool .
24:10:004:0	They decorate it with silver and with gold ; They fasten it with nails and with hammersSo that it will not totter .
24:10:005:0	Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they , And they cannot speak ; They must be carried , Because they cannot walk ! Do not fear them , For they can do no harm , Nor can they do any good . ”
24:10:006:0	There is none like You , O Lord ; You are great , and great is Your name in might .
24:10:007:0	Who would not fear You , O King of the nations ? Indeed it is Your due ! For among all the wise men of the nationsAnd in all their kingdoms , There is none like You .
24:10:008:0	But they are altogether stupid and foolish In their discipline of delusion—their idol is wood !
24:10:009:0	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish , And gold from Uphaz , The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith ; Violet and purple are their clothing ; They are all the work of skilled men .
24:10:010:0	But the Lord is the true God ; He is the living God and the everlasting King . At His wrath the earth quakes , And the nations cannot endure His indignation .
24:10:011:0	Thus you shall say to them , “ The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens . ”
24:10:012:0	It is He who made the earth by His power , Who established the world by His wisdom ; And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens .
24:10:013:0	When He utters His voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth ; He makes lightning for the rain , And brings out the wind from His storehouses .
24:10:014:0	Every man is stupid , devoid of knowledge ; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols ; For his molten images are deceitful , And there is no breath in them .
24:10:015:0	They are worthless , a work of mockery ; In the time of their punishment they will perish .
24:10:016:0	The portion of Jacob is not like these ; For the Maker of all is He , And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance ; The Lord of hosts is His name .
24:10:017:0	Pick up your bundle from the ground , You who dwell under siege !
24:10:018:0	For thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I am slinging out the inhabitants of the landAt this time , And will cause them distress , That they may be found . ”
24:10:019:0	Woe is me , because of my injury ! My wound is incurable . But I said , “ Truly this is a sickness , And I must bear it . ”
24:10:020:0	My tent is destroyed , And all my ropes are broken ; My sons have gone from me and are no more . There is no one to stretch out my tent againOr to set up my curtains .
24:10:021:0	For the shepherds have become stupidAnd have not sought the Lord ; Therefore they have not prospered , And all their flock is scattered .
24:10:022:0	The sound of a report ! Behold , it comes—A great commotion out of the land of the north—To make the cities of JudahA desolation , a haunt of jackals .
24:10:023:0	I know , O Lord , that a man’s way is not in himself , Nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps .
24:10:024:0	Correct me , O Lord , but with justice ; Not with Your anger , or You will bring me to nothing .
24:10:025:0	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know YouAnd on the families that do not call Your name ; For they have devoured Jacob ; They have devoured him and consumed himAnd have laid waste his habitation .
