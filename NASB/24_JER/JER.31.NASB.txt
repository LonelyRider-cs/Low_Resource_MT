24:31:001:1	Israel’s Mourning Turned to Joy
24:31:001:0	“ At that time , ” declares the Lord , “ I will be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be My people . ”
24:31:002:0	Thus says the Lord , “ The people who survived the swordFound grace in the wilderness—Israel , when it went to find its rest . ”
24:31:003:0	The Lord appeared to him from afar , saying , “ I have loved you with an everlasting love ; Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness .
24:31:004:0	Again I will build you and you will be rebuilt , O virgin of Israel ! Again you will take up your tambourines , And go forth to the dances of the merrymakers .
24:31:005:0	Again you will plant vineyardsOn the hills of Samaria ; The planters will plantAnd will enjoy them .
24:31:006:0	For there will be a day when watchmenOn the hills of Ephraim call out , ‘Arise , and let us go up to Zion , To the Lord our God . ’ ”
24:31:007:0	For thus says the Lord , “ Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob , And shout among the chief of the nations ; Proclaim , give praise and say , ‘O Lord , save Your people , The remnant of Israel . ’
24:31:008:0	Behold , I am bringing them from the north country , And I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth , Among them the blind and the lame , The woman with child and she who is in labor with child , together ; A great company , they will return here .
24:31:009:0	With weeping they will come , And by supplication I will lead them ; I will make them walk by streams of waters , On a straight path in which they will not stumble ; For I am a father to Israel , And Ephraim is My firstborn . ”
24:31:010:0	Hear the word of the Lord , O nations , And declare in the coastlands afar off , And say , “ He who scattered Israel will gather himAnd keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock . ”
24:31:011:0	For the Lord has ransomed JacobAnd redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he .
24:31:012:0	“ They will come and shout for joy on the height of Zion , And they will be radiant over the bounty of the Lord—Over the grain and the new wine and the oil , And over the young of the flock and the herd ; And their life will be like a watered garden , And they will never languish again .
24:31:013:0	Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance , And the young men and the old , together , For I will turn their mourning into joyAnd will comfort them and give them joy for their sorrow .
24:31:014:0	I will fill the soul of the priests with abundance , And My people will be satisfied with My goodness , ” declares the Lord .
24:31:015:0	Thus says the Lord , “ A voice is heard in Ramah , Lamentation and bitter weeping . Rachel is weeping for her children ; She refuses to be comforted for her children , Because they are no more . ”
24:31:016:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Restrain your voice from weepingAnd your eyes from tears ; For your work will be rewarded , ” declares the Lord , “ And they will return from the land of the enemy .
24:31:017:0	There is hope for your future , ” declares the Lord , “ And your children will return to their own territory .
24:31:018:0	I have surely heard Ephraim grieving , ‘You have chastised me , and I was chastised , Like an untrained calf ; Bring me back that I may be restored , For You are the Lord my God .
24:31:019:0	For after I turned back , I repented ; And after I was instructed , I smote on my thigh ; I was ashamed and also humiliatedBecause I bore the reproach of my youth . ’
24:31:020:0	Is Ephraim My dear son ? Is he a delightful child ? Indeed , as often as I have spoken against him , I certainly still remember him ; Therefore My heart yearns for him ; I will surely have mercy on him , ” declares the Lord .
24:31:021:0	“ Set up for yourself roadmarks , Place for yourself guideposts ; Direct your mind to the highway , The way by which you went . Return , O virgin of Israel , Return to these your cities .
24:31:022:0	How long will you go here and there , O faithless daughter ? For the Lord has created a new thing in the earth—A woman will encompass a man . ”
24:31:023:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes , ‘The Lord bless you , O abode of righteousness , O holy hill ! ’
24:31:024:0	Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it , the farmer and they who go about with flocks .
24:31:025:0	For I satisfy the weary ones and refresh everyone who languishes . ”
24:31:002:1	A New Covenant
24:31:026:0	At this I awoke and looked , and my sleep was pleasant to me .
24:31:027:0	“ Behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast .
24:31:028:0	As I have watched over them to pluck up , to break down , to overthrow , to destroy and to bring disaster , so I will watch over them to build and to plant , ” declares the Lord .
24:31:029:0	“ In those days they will not say again , ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes , And the children’s teeth are set on edge . ’
24:31:030:0	But everyone will die for his own iniquity ; each man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth will be set on edge .
24:31:031:0	“ Behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ,
24:31:032:0	not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt , My covenant which they broke , although I was a husband to them , ” declares the Lord .
24:31:033:0	“ But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days , ” declares the Lord , “ I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it ; and I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
24:31:034:0	They will not teach again , each man his neighbor and each man his brother , saying , ‘Know the Lord , ’ for they will all know Me , from the least of them to the greatest of them , ” declares the Lord , “ for I will forgive their iniquity , and their sin I will remember no more . ”
24:31:035:0	Thus says the Lord , Who gives the sun for light by dayAnd the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night , Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar ; The Lord of hosts is His name :
24:31:036:0	“ If this fixed order departsFrom before Me , ” declares the Lord , “ Then the offspring of Israel also will ceaseFrom being a nation before Me forever . ”
24:31:037:0	Thus says the Lord , “ If the heavens above can be measuredAnd the foundations of the earth searched out below , Then I will also cast off all the offspring of IsraelFor all that they have done , ” declares the Lord .
24:31:038:0	“ Behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when the city will be rebuilt for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
24:31:039:0	The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb ; then it will turn to Goah .
24:31:040:0	And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes , and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron , to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east , shall be holy to the Lord ; it will not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever . ”
