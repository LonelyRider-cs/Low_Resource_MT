24:42:001:1	Warning against Going to Egypt
24:42:001:0	Then all the commanders of the forces , Johanan the son of Kareah , Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people both small and great approached
24:42:002:0	and said to Jeremiah the prophet , “ Please let our petition come before you , and pray for us to the Lord your God , that is for all this remnant ; because we are left but a few out of many , as your own eyes now see us ,
24:42:003:0	that the Lord your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do . ”
24:42:004:0	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them , “ I have heard you . Behold , I am going to pray to the Lord your God in accordance with your words ; and I will tell you the whole message which the Lord will answer you . I will not keep back a word from you . ”
24:42:005:0	Then they said to Jeremiah , “ May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the Lord your God will send you to us .
24:42:006:0	Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant , we will listen to the voice of the Lord our God to whom we are sending you , so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the Lord our God . ”
24:42:007:0	Now at the end of ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah .
24:42:008:0	Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him , and for all the people both small and great ,
24:42:009:0	and said to them , “ Thus says the Lord the God of Israel , to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him :
24:42:010:0	‘If you will indeed stay in this land , then I will build you up and not tear you down , and I will plant you and not uproot you ; for I will relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you .
24:42:011:0	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon , whom you are now fearing ; do not be afraid of him , ’ declares the Lord , ‘for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand .
24:42:012:0	I will also show you compassion , so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil .
24:42:013:0	But if you are going to say , “ We will not stay in this land , ” so as not to listen to the voice of the Lord your God ,
24:42:014:0	saying , “ No , but we will go to the land of Egypt , where we will not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread , and we will stay there ” ;
24:42:015:0	then in that case listen to the word of the Lord , O remnant of Judah . Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ If you really set your mind to enter Egypt and go in to reside there ,
24:42:016:0	then the sword , which you are afraid of , will overtake you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are anxious , will follow closely after you there in Egypt , and you will die there .
24:42:017:0	So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword , by famine and by pestilence ; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them . ” ’ ”
24:42:018:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ As My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt . And you will become a curse , an object of horror , an imprecation and a reproach ; and you will see this place no more . ”
24:42:019:0	The Lord has spoken to you , O remnant of Judah , “ Do not go into Egypt ! ” You should clearly understand that today I have testified against you .
24:42:020:0	For you have only deceived yourselves ; for it is you who sent me to the Lord your God , saying , “ Pray for us to the Lord our God ; and whatever the Lord our God says , tell us so , and we will do it . ”
24:42:021:0	So I have told you today , but you have not obeyed the Lord your God , even in whatever He has sent me to tell you .
24:42:022:0	Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword , by famine and by pestilence , in the place where you wish to go to reside .
