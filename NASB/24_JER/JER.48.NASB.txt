24:48:001:1	Prophecy against Moab
24:48:001:0	Concerning Moab . Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ Woe to Nebo , for it has been destroyed ; Kiriathaim has been put to shame , it has been captured ; The lofty stronghold has been put to shame and shattered .
24:48:002:0	There is praise for Moab no longer ; In Heshbon they have devised calamity against her : ‘Come and let us cut her off from being a nation ! ’You too , Madmen , will be silenced ; The sword will follow after you .
24:48:003:0	The sound of an outcry from Horonaim , ‘Devastation and great destruction ! ’
24:48:004:0	Moab is broken , Her little ones have sounded out a cry of distress .
24:48:005:0	For by the ascent of LuhithThey will ascend with continual weeping ; For at the descent of HoronaimThey have heard the anguished cry of destruction .
24:48:006:0	Flee , save your lives , That you may be like a juniper in the wilderness .
24:48:007:0	For because of your trust in your own achievements and treasures , Even you yourself will be captured ; And Chemosh will go off into exileTogether with his priests and his princes .
24:48:008:0	A destroyer will come to every city , So that no city will escape ; The valley also will be ruinedAnd the plateau will be destroyed , As the Lord has said .
24:48:009:0	Give wings to Moab , For she will flee away ; And her cities will become a desolation , Without inhabitants in them .
24:48:010:0	Cursed be the one who does the Lord’s work negligently , And cursed be the one who restrains his sword from blood .
24:48:011:0	“ Moab has been at ease since his youth ; He has also been undisturbed , like wine on its dregs , And he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel , Nor has he gone into exile . Therefore he retains his flavor , And his aroma has not changed .
24:48:012:0	Therefore behold , the days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when I will send to him those who tip vessels , and they will tip him over , and they will empty his vessels and shatter his jars .
24:48:013:0	And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel , their confidence .
24:48:014:0	How can you say , ‘We are mighty warriors , And men valiant for battle’ ?
24:48:015:0	Moab has been destroyed and men have gone up to his cities ; His choicest young men have also gone down to the slaughter , ” Declares the King , whose name is the Lord of hosts .
24:48:016:0	“ The disaster of Moab will soon come , And his calamity has swiftly hastened .
24:48:017:0	Mourn for him , all you who live around him , Even all of you who know his name ; Say , ‘How has the mighty scepter been broken , A staff of splendor ! ’
24:48:018:0	Come down from your gloryAnd sit on the parched ground , O daughter dwelling in Dibon , For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you , He has ruined your strongholds .
24:48:019:0	Stand by the road and keep watch , O inhabitant of Aroer ; Ask him who flees and her who escapes And say , ‘What has happened ? ’
24:48:020:0	Moab has been put to shame , for it has been shattered . Wail and cry out ; Declare by the ArnonThat Moab has been destroyed .
24:48:021:0	“ Judgment has also come upon the plain , upon Holon , Jahzah and against Mephaath ,
24:48:022:0	against Dibon , Nebo and Beth-diblathaim ,
24:48:023:0	against Kiriathaim , Beth-gamul and Beth-meon ,
24:48:024:0	against Kerioth , Bozrah and all the cities of the land of Moab , far and near .
24:48:025:0	The horn of Moab has been cut off and his arm broken , ” declares the Lord .
24:48:026:0	“ Make him drunk , for he has become arrogant toward the Lord ; so Moab will wallow in his vomit , and he also will become a laughingstock .
24:48:027:0	Now was not Israel a laughingstock to you ? Or was he caught among thieves ? For each time you speak about him you shake your head in scorn .
24:48:028:0	Leave the cities and dwell among the crags , O inhabitants of Moab , And be like a dove that nestsBeyond the mouth of the chasm .
24:48:029:0	We have heard of the pride of Moab—he is very proud—Of his haughtiness , his pride , his arrogance and his self-exaltation .
24:48:030:0	I know his fury , ” declares the Lord , “ But it is futile ; His idle boasts have accomplished nothing .
24:48:031:0	Therefore I will wail for Moab , Even for all Moab will I cry out ; I will moan for the men of Kir-heres .
24:48:032:0	More than the weeping for JazerI will weep for you , O vine of Sibmah ! Your tendrils stretched across the sea , They reached to the sea of Jazer ; Upon your summer fruits and your grape harvestThe destroyer has fallen .
24:48:033:0	So gladness and joy are taken awayFrom the fruitful field , even from the land of Moab . And I have made the wine to cease from the wine presses ; No one will tread them with shouting , The shouting will not be shouts of joy .
24:48:034:0	From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh , even to Jahaz they have raised their voice , from Zoar even to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah ; for even the waters of Nimrim will become desolate .
24:48:035:0	I will make an end of Moab , ” declares the Lord , “ the one who offers sacrifice on the high place and the one who burns incense to his gods .
24:48:036:0	“ Therefore My heart wails for Moab like flutes ; My heart also wails like flutes for the men of Kir-heres . Therefore they have lost the abundance it produced .
24:48:037:0	For every head is bald and every beard cut short ; there are gashes on all the hands and sackcloth on the loins .
24:48:038:0	On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation everywhere ; for I have broken Moab like an undesirable vessel , ” declares the Lord .
24:48:039:0	“ How shattered it is ! How they have wailed ! How Moab has turned his back—he is ashamed ! So Moab will become a laughingstock and an object of terror to all around him . ”
24:48:040:0	For thus says the Lord : “ Behold , one will fly swiftly like an eagleAnd spread out his wings against Moab .
24:48:041:0	Kerioth has been capturedAnd the strongholds have been seized , So the hearts of the mighty men of Moab in that dayWill be like the heart of a woman in labor .
24:48:042:0	Moab will be destroyed from being a peopleBecause he has become arrogant toward the Lord .
24:48:043:0	Terror , pit and snare are coming upon you , O inhabitant of Moab , ” declares the Lord .
24:48:044:0	“ The one who flees from the terrorWill fall into the pit , And the one who climbs up out of the pitWill be caught in the snare ; For I shall bring upon her , even upon Moab , The year of their punishment , ” declares the Lord .
24:48:045:0	“ In the shadow of HeshbonThe fugitives stand without strength ; For a fire has gone forth from HeshbonAnd a flame from the midst of Sihon , And it has devoured the forehead of MoabAnd the scalps of the riotous revelers .
24:48:046:0	Woe to you , Moab ! The people of Chemosh have perished ; For your sons have been taken away captiveAnd your daughters into captivity .
24:48:047:0	Yet I will restore the fortunes of MoabIn the latter days , ” declares the Lord . Thus far the judgment on Moab .
