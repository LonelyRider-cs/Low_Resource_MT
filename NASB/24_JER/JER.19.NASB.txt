24:19:001:1	The Broken Jar
24:19:001:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jar , and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests .
24:19:002:0	Then go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom , which is by the entrance of the potsherd gate , and proclaim there the words that I tell you ,
24:19:003:0	and say , ‘Hear the word of the Lord , O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ Behold I am about to bring a calamity upon this place , at which the ears of everyone that hears of it will tingle .
24:19:004:0	Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods , that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known , and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent
24:19:005:0	and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal , a thing which I never commanded or spoke of , nor did it ever enter My mind ;
24:19:006:0	therefore , behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom , but rather the valley of Slaughter .
24:19:007:0	I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place , and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life ; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth .
24:19:008:0	I will also make this city a desolation and an object of hissing ; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its disasters .
24:19:009:0	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they will eat one another’s flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will distress them . ” ’
24:19:010:0	“ Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you
24:19:011:0	and say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Just so will I break this people and this city , even as one breaks a potter’s vessel , which cannot again be repaired ; and they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place for burial .
24:19:012:0	This is how I will treat this place and its inhabitants , ” declares the Lord , “ so as to make this city like Topheth .
24:19:013:0	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth , because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods . ” ’ ”
24:19:014:0	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth , where the Lord had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the Lord’s house and said to all the people :
24:19:015:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , ‘Behold , I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire calamity that I have declared against it , because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words . ’ ”
