24:9:001:1	A Lament over Zion
24:9:001:0	Oh that my head were watersAnd my eyes a fountain of tears , That I might weep day and nightFor the slain of the daughter of my people !
24:9:002:0	Oh that I had in the desertA wayfarers’ lodging place ; That I might leave my peopleAnd go from them ! For all of them are adulterers , An assembly of treacherous men .
24:9:003:0	“ They bend their tongue like their bow ; Lies and not truth prevail in the land ; For they proceed from evil to evil , And they do not know Me , ” declares the Lord .
24:9:004:0	“ Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor , And do not trust any brother ; Because every brother deals craftily , And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer .
24:9:005:0	Everyone deceives his neighborAnd does not speak the truth , They have taught their tongue to speak lies ; They weary themselves committing iniquity .
24:9:006:0	Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit ; Through deceit they refuse to know Me , ” declares the Lord .
24:9:007:0	Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Behold , I will refine them and assay them ; For what else can I do , because of the daughter of My people ?
24:9:008:0	Their tongue is a deadly arrow ; It speaks deceit ; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor , But inwardly he sets an ambush for him .
24:9:009:0	Shall I not punish them for these things ? ” declares the Lord . “ On a nation such as thisShall I not avenge Myself ?
24:9:010:0	“ For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing , And for the pastures of the wilderness a dirge , Because they are laid waste so that no one passes through , And the lowing of the cattle is not heard ; Both the birds of the sky and the beasts have fled ; they are gone .
24:9:011:0	I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins , A haunt of jackals ; And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant . ”
24:9:012:0	Who is the wise man that may understand this ? And who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken , that he may declare it ? Why is the land ruined , laid waste like a desert , so that no one passes through ?
24:9:013:0	The Lord said , “ Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them , and have not obeyed My voice nor walked according to it ,
24:9:014:0	but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals , as their fathers taught them , ”
24:9:015:0	therefore thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ behold , I will feed them , this people , with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink .
24:9:016:0	I will scatter them among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them . ”
24:9:017:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Consider and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; And send for the wailing women , that they may come !
24:9:018:0	Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us , That our eyes may shed tearsAnd our eyelids flow with water .
24:9:019:0	For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion , ‘How are we ruined ! We are put to great shame , For we have left the land , Because they have cast down our dwellings . ’ ”
24:9:020:0	Now hear the word of the Lord , O you women , And let your ear receive the word of His mouth ; Teach your daughters wailing , And everyone her neighbor a dirge .
24:9:021:0	For death has come up through our windows ; It has entered our palacesTo cut off the children from the streets , The young men from the town squares .
24:9:022:0	Speak , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘The corpses of men will fall like dung on the open field , And like the sheaf after the reaper , But no one will gather them . ’ ”
24:9:023:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom , and let not the mighty man boast of his might , let not a rich man boast of his riches ;
24:9:024:0	but let him who boasts boast of this , that he understands and knows Me , that I am the Lord who exercises lovingkindness , justice and righteousness on earth ; for I delight in these things , ” declares the Lord .
24:9:025:0	“ Behold , the days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ that I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised—
24:9:026:0	Egypt and Judah , and Edom and the sons of Ammon , and Moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples ; for all the nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart . ”
