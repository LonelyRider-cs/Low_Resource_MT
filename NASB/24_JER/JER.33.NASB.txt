24:33:001:1	Restoration Promised
24:33:001:0	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was still confined in the court of the guard , saying ,
24:33:002:0	“ Thus says the Lord who made the earth , the Lord who formed it to establish it , the Lord is His name ,
24:33:003:0	‘Call to Me and I will answer you , and I will tell you great and mighty things , which you do not know . ’
24:33:004:0	For thus says the Lord God of Israel concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which are broken down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword ,
24:33:005:0	‘While they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill them with the corpses of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath , and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness :
24:33:006:0	Behold , I will bring to it health and healing , and I will heal them ; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth .
24:33:007:0	I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel and will rebuild them as they were at first .
24:33:008:0	I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me , and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me .
24:33:009:0	It will be to Me a name of joy , praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for them , and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it . ’
24:33:010:0	“ Thus says the Lord , ‘Yet again there will be heard in this place , of which you say , “ It is a waste , without man and without beast , ” that is , in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate , without man and without inhabitant and without beast ,
24:33:011:0	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the voice of those who say , “ Give thanks to the Lord of hosts , For the Lord is good , For His lovingkindness is everlasting ” ; and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of the Lord . For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first , ’ says the Lord .
24:33:012:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘There will again be in this place which is waste , without man or beast , and in all its cities , a habitation of shepherds who rest their flocks .
24:33:002:1	The Davidic Kingdom
24:33:013:0	In the cities of the hill country , in the cities of the lowland , in the cities of the Negev , in the land of Benjamin , in the environs of Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah , the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who numbers them , ’ says the Lord .
24:33:014:0	‘Behold , days are coming , ’ declares the Lord , ‘when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah .
24:33:015:0	In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth ; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth .
24:33:016:0	In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety ; and this is the name by which she will be called : the Lord is our righteousness . ’
24:33:017:0	For thus says the Lord , ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel ;
24:33:018:0	and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings , to burn grain offerings and to prepare sacrifices continually . ’ ”
24:33:019:0	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying ,
24:33:020:0	“ Thus says the Lord , ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night , so that day and night will not be at their appointed time ,
24:33:021:0	then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne , and with the Levitical priests , My ministers .
24:33:022:0	As the host of heaven cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured , so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me . ’ ”
24:33:023:0	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying ,
24:33:024:0	“ Have you not observed what this people have spoken , saying , ‘The two families which the Lord chose , He has rejected them’ ? Thus they despise My people , no longer are they as a nation in their sight .
24:33:025:0	Thus says the Lord , ‘If My covenant for day and night stand not , and the fixed patterns of heaven and earth I have not established ,
24:33:026:0	then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant , not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . But I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them . ’ ”
