24:16:001:1	Distresses Foretold
24:16:001:0	The word of the Lord also came to me saying ,
24:16:002:0	“ You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place . ”
24:16:003:0	For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters born in this place , and concerning their mothers who bear them , and their fathers who beget them in this land :
24:16:004:0	“ They will die of deadly diseases , they will not be lamented or buried ; they will be as dung on the surface of the ground and come to an end by sword and famine , and their carcasses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth . ”
24:16:005:0	For thus says the Lord , “ Do not enter a house of mourning , or go to lament or to console them ; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people , ” declares the Lord , “ My lovingkindness and compassion .
24:16:006:0	Both great men and small will die in this land ; they will not be buried , they will not be lamented , nor will anyone gash himself or shave his head for them .
24:16:007:0	Men will not break bread in mourning for them , to comfort anyone for the dead , nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone’s father or mother .
24:16:008:0	Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink . ”
24:16:009:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ Behold , I am going to eliminate from this place , before your eyes and in your time , the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness , the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride .
24:16:010:0	“ Now when you tell this people all these words , they will say to you , ‘For what reason has the Lord declared all this great calamity against us ? And what is our iniquity , or what is our sin which we have committed against the Lord our God ? ’
24:16:011:0	Then you are to say to them , ‘It is because your forefathers have forsaken Me , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and have followed other gods and served them and bowed down to them ; but Me they have forsaken and have not kept My law .
24:16:012:0	You too have done evil , even more than your forefathers ; for behold , you are each one walking according to the stubbornness of his own evil heart , without listening to Me .
24:16:002:1	God Will Restore Them
24:16:013:0	So I will hurl you out of this land into the land which you have not known , neither you nor your fathers ; and there you will serve other gods day and night , for I will grant you no favor . ’
24:16:014:0	“ Therefore behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when it will no longer be said , ‘As the Lord lives , who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt , ’
24:16:015:0	but , ‘As the Lord lives , who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries where He had banished them . ’ For I will restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers .
24:16:016:0	“ Behold , I am going to send for many fishermen , ” declares the Lord , “ and they will fish for them ; and afterwards I will send for many hunters , and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill and from the clefts of the rocks .
24:16:017:0	For My eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from My face , nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes .
24:16:018:0	I will first doubly repay their iniquity and their sin , because they have polluted My land ; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with their abominations . ”
24:16:019:0	O Lord , my strength and my stronghold , And my refuge in the day of distress , To You the nations will comeFrom the ends of the earth and say , “ Our fathers have inherited nothing but falsehood , Futility and things of no profit . ”
24:16:020:0	Can man make gods for himself ? Yet they are not gods !
24:16:021:0	“ Therefore behold , I am going to make them know—This time I will make them knowMy power and My might ; And they shall know that My name is the Lord . ”
