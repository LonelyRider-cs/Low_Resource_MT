24:29:001:1	Message to the Exiles
24:29:001:0	Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile , the priests , the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon .
24:29:002:0	( This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother , the court officials , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem . )
24:29:003:0	The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , saying ,
24:29:004:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon ,
24:29:005:0	‘Build houses and live in them ; and plant gardens and eat their produce .
24:29:006:0	Take wives and become the fathers of sons and daughters , and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there and do not decrease .
24:29:007:0	Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile , and pray to the Lord on its behalf ; for in its welfare you will have welfare . ’
24:29:008:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you , and do not listen to the dreams which they dream .
24:29:009:0	For they prophesy falsely to you in My name ; I have not sent them , ’ declares the Lord .
24:29:010:0	“ For thus says the Lord , ‘When seventy years have been completed for Babylon , I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you , to bring you back to this place .
24:29:011:0	For I know the plans that I have for you , ’ declares the Lord , ‘plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope .
24:29:012:0	Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me , and I will listen to you .
24:29:013:0	You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart .
24:29:014:0	I will be found by you , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you , ’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile . ’
24:29:015:0	“ Because you have said , ‘The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’—
24:29:016:0	for thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David , and concerning all the people who dwell in this city , your brothers who did not go with you into exile—
24:29:017:0	thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Behold , I am sending upon them the sword , famine and pestilence , and I will make them like split-open figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness .
24:29:018:0	I will pursue them with the sword , with famine and with pestilence ; and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth , to be a curse and a horror and a hissing , and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them ,
24:29:019:0	because they have not listened to My words , ’ declares the Lord , ‘which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets ; but you did not listen , ’ declares the Lord .
24:29:020:0	You , therefore , hear the word of the Lord , all you exiles , whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon .
24:29:021:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah , who are prophesying to you falsely in My name , ‘Behold , I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he will slay them before your eyes .
24:29:022:0	Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon , saying , “ May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ,
24:29:023:0	because they have acted foolishly in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have spoken words in My name falsely , which I did not command them ; and I am He who knows and am a witness , ” declares the Lord . ’ ”
24:29:024:0	To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak , saying ,
24:29:025:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
24:29:026:0	“ The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest , to be the overseer in the house of the Lord over every madman who prophesies , to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar ,
24:29:027:0	now then , why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you ?
24:29:028:0	For he has sent to us in Babylon , saying , ‘The exile will be long ; build houses and live in them and plant gardens and eat their produce . ’ ” ’ ”
24:29:029:0	Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet .
24:29:030:0	Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah , saying ,
24:29:031:0	“ Send to all the exiles , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite , “ Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you , although I did not send him , and he has made you trust in a lie , ”
24:29:032:0	therefore thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants ; he will not have anyone living among this people , and he will not see the good that I am about to do to My people , ” declares the Lord , “ because he has preached rebellion against the Lord . ” ’ ”
