24:36:001:1	Jeremiah’s Scroll Read in the Temple
24:36:001:0	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
24:36:002:0	“ Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel and concerning Judah , and concerning all the nations , from the day I first spoke to you , from the days of Josiah , even to this day .
24:36:003:0	Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity which I plan to bring on them , in order that every man will turn from his evil way ; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin . ”
24:36:004:0	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah , and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which He had spoken to him .
24:36:005:0	Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , “ I am restricted ; I cannot go into the house of the Lord .
24:36:006:0	So you go and read from the scroll which you have written at my dictation the words of the Lord to the people in the Lord’s house on a fast day . And also you shall read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities .
24:36:007:0	Perhaps their supplication will come before the Lord , and everyone will turn from his evil way , for great is the anger and the wrath that the Lord has pronounced against this people . ”
24:36:008:0	Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lord’s house .
24:36:009:0	Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , in the ninth month , all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord .
24:36:010:0	Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord’s house , to all the people .
24:36:011:0	Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard all the words of the Lord from the book ,
24:36:012:0	he went down to the king’s house , into the scribe’s chamber . And behold , all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the other officials .
24:36:013:0	Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people .
24:36:014:0	Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , to Baruch , saying , “ Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come . ” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them .
24:36:015:0	They said to him , “ Sit down , please , and read it to us . ” So Baruch read it to them .
24:36:016:0	When they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch , “ We will surely report all these words to the king . ”
24:36:017:0	And they asked Baruch , saying , “ Tell us , please , how did you write all these words ? Was it at his dictation ? ”
24:36:018:0	Then Baruch said to them , “ He dictated all these words to me , and I wrote them with ink on the book . ”
24:36:002:1	The Scroll Is Burned
24:36:019:0	Then the officials said to Baruch , “ Go , hide yourself , you and Jeremiah , and do not let anyone know where you are . ”
24:36:020:0	So they went to the king in the court , but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and they reported all the words to the king .
24:36:021:0	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll , and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe . And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king .
24:36:022:0	Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month , with a fire burning in the brazier before him .
24:36:023:0	When Jehudi had read three or four columns , the king cut it with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier .
24:36:024:0	Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid , nor did they rend their garments .
24:36:025:0	Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll , he would not listen to them .
24:36:003:1	The Scroll Is Replaced
24:36:026:0	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son , Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet , but the Lord hid them .
24:36:027:0	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah , saying ,
24:36:028:0	“ Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned .
24:36:029:0	And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ You have burned this scroll , saying , ‘Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land , and will make man and beast to cease from it ? ’ ”
24:36:030:0	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah , “ He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David , and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night .
24:36:031:0	I will also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity , and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them—but they did not listen . ” ’ ”
24:36:032:0	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah , the scribe , and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire ; and many similar words were added to them .
