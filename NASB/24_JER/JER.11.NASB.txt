24:11:001:1	The Broken Covenant
24:11:001:0	The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
24:11:002:0	“ Hear the words of this covenant , and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
24:11:003:0	and say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , “ Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant
24:11:004:0	which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , from the iron furnace , saying , ‘Listen to My voice , and do according to all which I command you ; so you shall be My people , and I will be your God , ’
24:11:005:0	in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day . ” ’ ” Then I said , “ Amen , O Lord . ”
24:11:006:0	And the Lord said to me , “ Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them .
24:11:007:0	For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt , even to this day , warning persistently , saying , “ Listen to My voice . ”
24:11:008:0	Yet they did not obey or incline their ear , but walked , each one , in the stubbornness of his evil heart ; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant , which I commanded them to do , but they did not . ’ ”
24:11:009:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
24:11:010:0	They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words , and they have gone after other gods to serve them ; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers . ”
24:11:011:0	Therefore thus says the Lord , “ Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape ; though they will cry to Me , yet I will not listen to them .
24:11:012:0	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense , but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster .
24:11:013:0	For your gods are as many as your cities , O Judah ; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing , altars to burn incense to Baal .
24:11:014:0	“ Therefore do not pray for this people , nor lift up a cry or prayer for them ; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster .
24:11:015:0	What right has My beloved in My houseWhen she has done many vile deeds ? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster , So that you can rejoice ? ”
24:11:016:0	The Lord called your name , “ A green olive tree , beautiful in fruit and form ” ; With the noise of a great tumultHe has kindled fire on it , And its branches are worthless .
24:11:002:1	Plots against Jeremiah
24:11:017:0	The Lord of hosts , who planted you , has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have done to provoke Me by offering up sacrifices to Baal .
24:11:018:0	Moreover , the Lord made it known to me and I knew it ; Then You showed me their deeds .
24:11:019:0	But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter ; And I did not know that they had devised plots against me , saying , “ Let us destroy the tree with its fruit , And let us cut him off from the land of the living , That his name be remembered no more . ”
24:11:020:0	But , O Lord of hosts , who judges righteously , Who tries the feelings and the heart , Let me see Your vengeance on them , For to You have I committed my cause .
24:11:021:0	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth , who seek your life , saying , “ Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord , so that you will not die at our hand ” ;
24:11:022:0	therefore , thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Behold , I am about to punish them ! The young men will die by the sword , their sons and daughters will die by famine ;
24:11:023:0	and a remnant will not be left to them , for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth—the year of their punishment . ”
