24:22:001:1	Warning of Jerusalem’s Fall
24:22:001:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Go down to the house of the king of Judah , and there speak this word
24:22:002:0	and say , ‘Hear the word of the Lord , O king of Judah , who sits on David’s throne , you and your servants and your people who enter these gates .
24:22:003:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Do justice and righteousness , and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor . Also do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger , the orphan , or the widow ; and do not shed innocent blood in this place .
24:22:004:0	For if you men will indeed perform this thing , then kings will enter the gates of this house , sitting in David’s place on his throne , riding in chariots and on horses , even the king himself and his servants and his people .
24:22:005:0	But if you will not obey these words , I swear by Myself , ” declares the Lord , “ that this house will become a desolation . ” ’ ”
24:22:006:0	For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah : “ You are like Gilead to Me , Like the summit of Lebanon ; Yet most assuredly I will make you like a wilderness , Like cities which are not inhabited .
24:22:007:0	For I will set apart destroyers against you , Each with his weapons ; And they will cut down your choicest cedarsAnd throw them on the fire .
24:22:008:0	“ Many nations will pass by this city ; and they will say to one another , ‘Why has the Lord done thus to this great city ? ’
24:22:009:0	Then they will answer , ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord their God and bowed down to other gods and served them . ’ ”
24:22:010:0	Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him , But weep continually for the one who goes away ; For he will never returnOr see his native land .
24:22:011:0	For thus says the Lord in regard to Shallum the son of Josiah , king of Judah , who became king in the place of Josiah his father , who went forth from this place , “ He will never return there ;
24:22:002:1	Messages about the Kings
24:22:012:0	but in the place where they led him captive , there he will die and not see this land again .
24:22:013:0	“ Woe to him who builds his house without righteousnessAnd his upper rooms without justice , Who uses his neighbor’s services without payAnd does not give him his wages ,
24:22:014:0	Who says , ‘I will build myself a roomy houseWith spacious upper rooms , And cut out its windows , Paneling it with cedar and painting it bright red . ’
24:22:015:0	Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar ? Did not your father eat and drinkAnd do justice and righteousness ? Then it was well with him .
24:22:016:0	He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy ; Then it was well . Is not that what it means to know Me ? ” Declares the Lord .
24:22:017:0	“ But your eyes and your heartAre intent only upon your own dishonest gain , And on shedding innocent bloodAnd on practicing oppression and extortion . ”
24:22:018:0	Therefore thus says the Lord in regard to Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , “ They will not lament for him : ‘Alas , my brother ! ’ or , ‘Alas , sister ! ’They will not lament for him : ‘Alas for the master ! ’ or , ‘Alas for his splendor ! ’
24:22:019:0	He will be buried with a donkey’s burial , Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
24:22:020:0	Go up to Lebanon and cry out , And lift up your voice in Bashan ; Cry out also from Abarim , For all your lovers have been crushed .
24:22:021:0	I spoke to you in your prosperity ; But you said , ‘I will not listen ! ’This has been your practice from your youth , That you have not obeyed My voice .
24:22:022:0	The wind will sweep away all your shepherds , And your lovers will go into captivity ; Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliatedBecause of all your wickedness .
24:22:023:0	You who dwell in Lebanon , Nested in the cedars , How you will groan when pangs come upon you , Pain like a woman in childbirth !
24:22:024:0	“ As I live , ” declares the Lord , “ even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand , yet I would pull you off ;
24:22:025:0	and I will give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life , yes , into the hand of those whom you dread , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
24:22:026:0	I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born , and there you will die .
24:22:027:0	But as for the land to which they desire to return , they will not return to it .
24:22:028:0	Is this man Coniah a despised , shattered jar ? Or is he an undesirable vessel ? Why have he and his descendants been hurled outAnd cast into a land that they had not known ?
24:22:029:0	O land , land , land , Hear the word of the Lord !
24:22:030:0	Thus says the Lord , ‘Write this man down childless , A man who will not prosper in his days ; For no man of his descendants will prosperSitting on the throne of DavidOr ruling again in Judah . ’ ”
