24:30:001:1	Deliverance from Captivity Promised
24:30:001:0	The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
24:30:002:0	“ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book .
24:30:003:0	For behold , days are coming , ’ declares the Lord , ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah . ’ The Lord says , ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers and they shall possess it . ’ ”
24:30:004:0	Now these are the words which the Lord spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah :
24:30:005:0	“ For thus says the Lord , ‘I have heard a sound of terror , Of dread , and there is no peace .
24:30:006:0	Ask now , and seeIf a male can give birth . Why do I see every man With his hands on his loins , as a woman in childbirth ? And why have all faces turned pale ?
24:30:007:0	Alas ! for that day is great , There is none like it ; And it is the time of Jacob’s distress , But he will be saved from it .
24:30:008:0	‘It shall come about on that day , ’ declares the Lord of hosts , ‘that I will break his yoke from off their neck and will tear off their bonds ; and strangers will no longer make them their slaves .
24:30:009:0	But they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king , whom I will raise up for them .
24:30:010:0	Fear not , O Jacob My servant , ’ declares the Lord , ‘And do not be dismayed , O Israel ; For behold , I will save you from afarAnd your offspring from the land of their captivity . And Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease , And no one will make him afraid .
24:30:011:0	For I am with you , ’ declares the Lord , ‘to save you ; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you , Only I will not destroy you completely . But I will chasten you justlyAnd will by no means leave you unpunished . ’
24:30:012:0	“ For thus says the Lord , ‘Your wound is incurableAnd your injury is serious .
24:30:013:0	There is no one to plead your cause ; No healing for your sore , No recovery for you .
24:30:014:0	All your lovers have forgotten you , They do not seek you ; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy , With the punishment of a cruel one , Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous .
24:30:015:0	Why do you cry out over your injury ? Your pain is incurable . Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous , I have done these things to you .
24:30:016:0	Therefore all who devour you will be devoured ; And all your adversaries , every one of them , will go into captivity ; And those who plunder you will be for plunder , And all who prey upon you I will give for prey .
24:30:002:1	Restoration of Jacob
24:30:017:0	For I will restore you to healthAnd I will heal you of your wounds , ’ declares the Lord , ‘Because they have called you an outcast , saying : “ It is Zion ; no one cares for her . ” ’
24:30:018:0	“ Thus says the Lord , ‘Behold , I will restore the fortunes of the tents of JacobAnd have compassion on his dwelling places ; And the city will be rebuilt on its ruin , And the palace will stand on its rightful place .
24:30:019:0	From them will proceed thanksgivingAnd the voice of those who celebrate ; And I will multiply them and they will not be diminished ; I will also honor them and they will not be insignificant .
24:30:020:0	Their children also will be as formerly , And their congregation shall be established before Me ; And I will punish all their oppressors .
24:30:021:0	Their leader shall be one of them , And their ruler shall come forth from their midst ; And I will bring him near and he shall approach Me ; For who would dare to risk his life to approach Me ? ’ declares the Lord .
24:30:022:0	‘You shall be My people , And I will be your God . ’ ”
24:30:023:0	Behold , the tempest of the Lord ! Wrath has gone forth , A sweeping tempest ; It will burst on the head of the wicked .
24:30:024:0	The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn backUntil He has performed and until He has accomplishedThe intent of His heart ; In the latter days you will understand this .
