24:27:001:1	The Nations to Submit to Nebuchadnezzar
24:27:001:0	In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying—
24:27:002:0	thus says the Lord to me— “ Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck ,
24:27:003:0	and send word to the king of Edom , to the king of Moab , to the king of the sons of Ammon , to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah .
24:27:004:0	Command them to go to their masters , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , thus you shall say to your masters ,
24:27:005:0	“ I have made the earth , the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm , and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight .
24:27:006:0	Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , My servant , and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him .
24:27:007:0	All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes ; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant .
24:27:008:0	“ It will be , that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , I will punish that nation with the sword , with famine and with pestilence , ” declares the Lord , “ until I have destroyed it by his hand .
24:27:009:0	But as for you , do not listen to your prophets , your diviners , your dreamers , your soothsayers or your sorcerers who speak to you , saying , ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon . ’
24:27:010:0	For they prophesy a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land ; and I will drive you out and you will perish .
24:27:011:0	But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him , I will let remain on its land , ” declares the Lord , “ and they will till it and dwell in it . ” ’ ”
24:27:012:0	I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah , saying , “ Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people , and live !
24:27:013:0	Why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , famine and pestilence , as the Lord has spoken to that nation which will not serve the king of Babylon ?
24:27:014:0	So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon , ’ for they prophesy a lie to you ;
24:27:015:0	for I have not sent them , ” declares the Lord , “ but they prophesy falsely in My name , in order that I may drive you out and that you may perish , you and the prophets who prophesy to you . ”
24:27:016:0	Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people , saying , “ Thus says the Lord : Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you , saying , ‘Behold , the vessels of the Lord’s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon’ ; for they are prophesying a lie to you .
24:27:017:0	Do not listen to them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live ! Why should this city become a ruin ?
24:27:018:0	But if they are prophets , and if the word of the Lord is with them , let them now entreat the Lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord , in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon .
24:27:019:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars , concerning the sea , concerning the stands and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city ,
24:27:020:0	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem .
24:27:021:0	Yes , thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem ,
24:27:022:0	‘They will be carried to Babylon and they will be there until the day I visit them , ’ declares the Lord . ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place . ’ ”
