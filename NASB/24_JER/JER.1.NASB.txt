24:1:001:1	Jeremiah’s Call and Commission
24:1:001:0	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin ,
24:1:002:0	to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
24:1:003:0	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah , king of Judah , until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month .
24:1:004:0	Now the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
24:1:005:0	“ Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , And before you were born I consecrated you ; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations . ”
24:1:006:0	Then I said , “ Alas , Lord God ! Behold , I do not know how to speak , Because I am a youth . ”
24:1:007:0	But the Lord said to me , “ Do not say , ‘I am a youth , ’Because everywhere I send you , you shall go , And all that I command you , you shall speak .
24:1:008:0	Do not be afraid of them , For I am with you to deliver you , ” declares the Lord .
24:1:009:0	Then the Lord stretched out His hand and touched my mouth , and the Lord said to me , “ Behold , I have put My words in your mouth .
24:1:002:1	The Almond Rod and Boiling Pot
24:1:010:0	See , I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms , To pluck up and to break down , To destroy and to overthrow , To build and to plant . ”
24:1:011:0	The word of the Lord came to me saying , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” And I said , “ I see a rod of an almond tree . ”
24:1:012:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ You have seen well , for I am watching over My word to perform it . ”
24:1:013:0	The word of the Lord came to me a second time saying , “ What do you see ? ” And I said , “ I see a boiling pot , facing away from the north . ”
24:1:014:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Out of the north the evil will break forth on all the inhabitants of the land .
24:1:015:0	For , behold , I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north , ” declares the Lord ; “ and they will come and they will set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls round about and against all the cities of Judah .
24:1:016:0	I will pronounce My judgments on them concerning all their wickedness , whereby they have forsaken Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods , and worshiped the works of their own hands .
24:1:017:0	Now , gird up your loins and arise , and speak to them all which I command you . Do not be dismayed before them , or I will dismay you before them .
24:1:018:0	Now behold , I have made you today as a fortified city and as a pillar of iron and as walls of bronze against the whole land , to the kings of Judah , to its princes , to its priests and to the people of the land .
24:1:019:0	They will fight against you , but they will not overcome you , for I am with you to deliver you , ” declares the Lord .
