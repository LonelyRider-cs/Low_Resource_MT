24:2:001:1	Judah’s Apostasy
24:2:001:0	Now the word of the Lord came to me saying ,
24:2:002:0	“ Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ I remember concerning you the devotion of your youth , The love of your betrothals , Your following after Me in the wilderness , Through a land not sown .
24:2:003:0	Israel was holy to the Lord , The first of His harvest . All who ate of it became guilty ; Evil came upon them , ” declares the Lord . ’ ”
24:2:004:0	Hear the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel .
24:2:005:0	Thus says the Lord , “ What injustice did your fathers find in Me , That they went far from MeAnd walked after emptiness and became empty ?
24:2:006:0	They did not say , ‘Where is the LordWho brought us up out of the land of Egypt , Who led us through the wilderness , Through a land of deserts and of pits , Through a land of drought and of deep darkness , Through a land that no one crossedAnd where no man dwelt ? ’
24:2:007:0	I brought you into the fruitful landTo eat its fruit and its good things . But you came and defiled My land , And My inheritance you made an abomination .
24:2:008:0	The priests did not say , ‘Where is the Lord ? ’And those who handle the law did not know Me ; The rulers also transgressed against Me , And the prophets prophesied by BaalAnd walked after things that did not profit .
24:2:009:0	“ Therefore I will yet contend with you , ” declares the Lord , “ And with your sons’ sons I will contend .
24:2:010:0	For cross to the coastlands of Kittim and see , And send to Kedar and observe closelyAnd see if there has been such a thing as this !
24:2:011:0	Has a nation changed godsWhen they were not gods ? But My people have changed their gloryFor that which does not profit .
24:2:012:0	Be appalled , O heavens , at this , And shudder , be very desolate , ” declares the Lord .
24:2:013:0	“ For My people have committed two evils : They have forsaken Me , The fountain of living waters , To hew for themselves cisterns , Broken cisternsThat can hold no water .
24:2:014:0	“ Is Israel a slave ? Or is he a homeborn servant ? Why has he become a prey ?
24:2:015:0	The young lions have roared at him , They have roared loudly . And they have made his land a waste ; His cities have been destroyed , without inhabitant .
24:2:016:0	Also the men of Memphis and TahpanhesHave shaved the crown of your head .
24:2:017:0	Have you not done this to yourselfBy your forsaking the Lord your GodWhen He led you in the way ?
24:2:018:0	But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt , To drink the waters of the Nile ? Or what are you doing on the road to Assyria , To drink the waters of the Euphrates ?
24:2:019:0	Your own wickedness will correct you , And your apostasies will reprove you ; Know therefore and see that it is evil and bitterFor you to forsake the Lord your God , And the dread of Me is not in you , ” declares the Lord God of hosts .
24:2:020:0	“ For long ago I broke your yoke And tore off your bonds ; But you said , ‘I will not serve ! ’For on every high hillAnd under every green treeYou have lain down as a harlot .
24:2:021:0	Yet I planted you a choice vine , A completely faithful seed . How then have you turned yourself before MeInto the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine ?
24:2:022:0	Although you wash yourself with lyeAnd use much soap , The stain of your iniquity is before Me , ” declares the Lord God .
24:2:023:0	“ How can you say , ‘I am not defiled , I have not gone after the Baals’ ? Look at your way in the valley ! Know what you have done ! You are a swift young camel entangling her ways ,
24:2:024:0	A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness , That sniffs the wind in her passion . In the time of her heat who can turn her away ? All who seek her will not become weary ; In her month they will find her .
24:2:025:0	Keep your feet from being unshodAnd your throat from thirst ; But you said , ‘It is hopeless ! No ! For I have loved strangers , And after them I will walk . ’
24:2:026:0	“ As the thief is shamed when he is discovered , So the house of Israel is shamed ; They , their kings , their princesAnd their priests and their prophets ,
24:2:027:0	Who say to a tree , ‘You are my father , ’And to a stone , ‘You gave me birth . ’For they have turned their back to Me , And not their face ; But in the time of their trouble they will say , ‘Arise and save us . ’
24:2:028:0	But where are your godsWhich you made for yourself ? Let them arise , if they can save youIn the time of your trouble ; For according to the number of your citiesAre your gods , O Judah .
24:2:029:0	“ Why do you contend with Me ? You have all transgressed against Me , ” declares the Lord .
24:2:030:0	“ In vain I have struck your sons ; They accepted no chastening . Your sword has devoured your prophetsLike a destroying lion .
24:2:031:0	O generation , heed the word of the Lord . Have I been a wilderness to Israel , Or a land of thick darkness ? Why do My people say , ‘We are free to roam ; We will no longer come to You’ ?
24:2:032:0	Can a virgin forget her ornaments , Or a bride her attire ? Yet My people have forgotten MeDays without number .
24:2:033:0	How well you prepare your wayTo seek love ! Therefore even the wicked womenYou have taught your ways .
24:2:034:0	Also on your skirts is foundThe lifeblood of the innocent poor ; You did not find them breaking in . But in spite of all these things ,
24:2:035:0	Yet you said , ‘I am innocent ; Surely His anger is turned away from me . ’Behold , I will enter into judgment with youBecause you say , ‘I have not sinned . ’
24:2:036:0	Why do you go around so muchChanging your way ? Also , you will be put to shame by EgyptAs you were put to shame by Assyria .
24:2:037:0	From this place also you will go outWith your hands on your head ; For the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust , And you will not prosper with them . ”
