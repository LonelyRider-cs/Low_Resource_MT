24:4:001:1	Judah Threatened with Invasion
24:4:001:0	“ If you will return , O Israel , ” declares the Lord , “ Then you should return to Me . And if you will put away your detested things from My presence , And will not waver ,
24:4:002:0	And you will swear , ‘As the Lord lives , ’In truth , in justice and in righteousness ; Then the nations will bless themselves in Him , And in Him they will glory . ”
24:4:003:0	For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem , “ Break up your fallow ground , And do not sow among thorns .
24:4:004:0	Circumcise yourselves to the LordAnd remove the foreskins of your heart , Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem , Or else My wrath will go forth like fireAnd burn with none to quench it , Because of the evil of your deeds . ”
24:4:005:0	Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem , and say , “ Blow the trumpet in the land ; Cry aloud and say , ‘Assemble yourselves , and let us goInto the fortified cities . ’
24:4:006:0	Lift up a standard toward Zion ! Seek refuge , do not stand still , For I am bringing evil from the north , And great destruction .
24:4:007:0	A lion has gone up from his thicket , And a destroyer of nations has set out ; He has gone out from his placeTo make your land a waste . Your cities will be ruinsWithout inhabitant .
24:4:008:0	For this , put on sackcloth , Lament and wail ; For the fierce anger of the LordHas not turned back from us . ”
24:4:009:0	“ It shall come about in that day , ” declares the Lord , “ that the heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail ; and the priests will be appalled and the prophets will be astounded . ”
24:4:010:0	Then I said , “ Ah , Lord God ! Surely You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem , saying , ‘You will have peace’ ; whereas a sword touches the throat . ”
24:4:011:0	In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem , “ A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness in the direction of the daughter of My people—not to winnow and not to cleanse ,
24:4:012:0	a wind too strong for this—will come at My command ; now I will also pronounce judgments against them .
24:4:013:0	Behold , he goes up like clouds , And his chariots like the whirlwind ; His horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us , for we are ruined ! ”
24:4:014:0	Wash your heart from evil , O Jerusalem , That you may be saved . How long will your wicked thoughtsLodge within you ?
24:4:015:0	For a voice declares from Dan , And proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim .
24:4:016:0	“ Report it to the nations , now ! Proclaim over Jerusalem , ‘Besiegers come from a far country , And lift their voices against the cities of Judah .
24:4:017:0	Like watchmen of a field they are against her round about , Because she has rebelled against Me , ’ declares the Lord .
24:4:002:1	Lament over Judah’s Devastation
24:4:018:0	Your ways and your deedsHave brought these things to you . This is your evil . How bitter ! How it has touched your heart ! ”
24:4:019:0	My soul , my soul ! I am in anguish ! Oh , my heart ! My heart is pounding in me ; I cannot be silent , Because you have heard , O my soul , The sound of the trumpet , The alarm of war .
24:4:020:0	Disaster on disaster is proclaimed , For the whole land is devastated ; Suddenly my tents are devastated , My curtains in an instant .
24:4:021:0	How long must I see the standardAnd hear the sound of the trumpet ?
24:4:022:0	“ For My people are foolish , They know Me not ; They are stupid childrenAnd have no understanding . They are shrewd to do evil , But to do good they do not know . ”
24:4:023:0	I looked on the earth , and behold , it was formless and void ; And to the heavens , and they had no light .
24:4:024:0	I looked on the mountains , and behold , they were quaking , And all the hills moved to and fro .
24:4:025:0	I looked , and behold , there was no man , And all the birds of the heavens had fled .
24:4:026:0	I looked , and behold , the fruitful land was a wilderness , And all its cities were pulled downBefore the Lord , before His fierce anger .
24:4:027:0	For thus says the Lord , “ The whole land shall be a desolation , Yet I will not execute a complete destruction .
24:4:028:0	For this the earth shall mournAnd the heavens above be dark , Because I have spoken , I have purposed , And I will not change My mind , nor will I turn from it . ”
24:4:029:0	At the sound of the horseman and bowman every city flees ; They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks ; Every city is forsaken , And no man dwells in them .
24:4:030:0	And you , O desolate one , what will you do ? Although you dress in scarlet , Although you decorate yourself with ornaments of gold , Although you enlarge your eyes with paint , In vain you make yourself beautiful . Your lovers despise you ; They seek your life .
24:4:031:0	For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor , The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child , The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath , Stretching out her hands , saying , “ Ah , woe is me , for I faint before murderers . ”
