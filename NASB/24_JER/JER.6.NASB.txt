24:6:001:1	Destruction of Jerusalem Impending
24:6:001:0	“ Flee for safety , O sons of Benjamin , From the midst of Jerusalem ! Now blow a trumpet in TekoaAnd raise a signal over Beth-haccerem ; For evil looks down from the north , And a great destruction .
24:6:002:0	The comely and dainty one , the daughter of Zion , I will cut off .
24:6:003:0	Shepherds and their flocks will come to her , They will pitch their tents around her , They will pasture each in his place .
24:6:004:0	Prepare war against her ; Arise , and let us attack at noon . Woe to us , for the day declines , For the shadows of the evening lengthen !
24:6:005:0	Arise , and let us attack by nightAnd destroy her palaces ! ”
24:6:006:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Cut down her treesAnd cast up a siege against Jerusalem . This is the city to be punished , In whose midst there is only oppression .
24:6:007:0	As a well keeps its waters fresh , So she keeps fresh her wickedness . Violence and destruction are heard in her ; Sickness and wounds are ever before Me .
24:6:008:0	Be warned , O Jerusalem , Or I shall be alienated from you , And make you a desolation , A land not inhabited . ”
24:6:009:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel ; Pass your hand again like a grape gathererOver the branches . ”
24:6:010:0	To whom shall I speak and give warningThat they may hear ? Behold , their ears are closedAnd they cannot listen . Behold , the word of the Lord has become a reproach to them ; They have no delight in it .
24:6:011:0	But I am full of the wrath of the Lord ; I am weary with holding it in . “ Pour it out on the children in the streetAnd on the gathering of young men together ; For both husband and wife shall be taken , The aged and the very old .
24:6:012:0	Their houses shall be turned over to others , Their fields and their wives together ; For I will stretch out My handAgainst the inhabitants of the land , ” declares the Lord .
24:6:013:0	“ For from the least of them even to the greatest of them , Everyone is greedy for gain , And from the prophet even to the priestEveryone deals falsely .
24:6:014:0	They have healed the brokenness of My people superficially , Saying , ‘Peace , peace , ’But there is no peace .
24:6:015:0	Were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done ? They were not even ashamed at all ; They did not even know how to blush . Therefore they shall fall among those who fall ; At the time that I punish them , They shall be cast down , ” says the Lord .
24:6:016:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths , Where the good way is , and walk in it ; And you will find rest for your souls . But they said , ‘We will not walk in it . ’
24:6:017:0	And I set watchmen over you , saying , ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet ! ’But they said , ‘We will not listen . ’
24:6:018:0	Therefore hear , O nations , And know , O congregation , what is among them .
24:6:019:0	Hear , O earth : behold , I am bringing disaster on this people , The fruit of their plans , Because they have not listened to My words , And as for My law , they have rejected it also .
24:6:020:0	For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from ShebaAnd the sweet cane from a distant land ? Your burnt offerings are not acceptableAnd your sacrifices are not pleasing to Me . ”
24:6:002:1	The Enemy from the North
24:6:021:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I am laying stumbling blocks before this people . And they will stumble against them , Fathers and sons together ; Neighbor and friend will perish . ”
24:6:022:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Behold , a people is coming from the north land , And a great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth .
24:6:023:0	They seize bow and spear ; They are cruel and have no mercy ; Their voice roars like the sea , And they ride on horses , Arrayed as a man for the battleAgainst you , O daughter of Zion ! ”
24:6:024:0	We have heard the report of it ; Our hands are limp . Anguish has seized us , Pain as of a woman in childbirth .
24:6:025:0	Do not go out into the fieldAnd do not walk on the road , For the enemy has a sword , Terror is on every side .
24:6:026:0	O daughter of my people , put on sackclothAnd roll in ashes ; Mourn as for an only son , A lamentation most bitter . For suddenly the destroyerWill come upon us .
24:6:027:0	“ I have made you an assayer and a tester among My people , That you may know and assay their way . ”
24:6:028:0	All of them are stubbornly rebellious , Going about as a talebearer . They are bronze and iron ; They , all of them , are corrupt .
24:6:029:0	The bellows blow fiercely , The lead is consumed by the fire ; In vain the refining goes on , But the wicked are not separated .
24:6:030:0	They call them rejected silver , Because the Lord has rejected them .
