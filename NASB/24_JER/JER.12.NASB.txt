24:12:001:1	Jeremiah’s Prayer
24:12:001:0	Righteous are You , O Lord , that I would plead my case with You ; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You : Why has the way of the wicked prospered ? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease ?
24:12:002:0	You have planted them , they have also taken root ; They grow , they have even produced fruit . You are near to their lipsBut far from their mind .
24:12:003:0	But You know me , O Lord ; You see me ; And You examine my heart’s attitude toward You . Drag them off like sheep for the slaughterAnd set them apart for a day of carnage !
24:12:004:0	How long is the land to mournAnd the vegetation of the countryside to wither ? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it , Animals and birds have been snatched away , Because men have said , “ He will not see our latter ending . ”
24:12:005:0	“ If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out , Then how can you compete with horses ? If you fall down in a land of peace , How will you do in the thicket of the Jordan ?
24:12:002:1	God’s Answer
24:12:006:0	For even your brothers and the household of your father , Even they have dealt treacherously with you , Even they have cried aloud after you . Do not believe them , although they may say nice things to you . ”
24:12:007:0	“ I have forsaken My house , I have abandoned My inheritance ; I have given the beloved of My soulInto the hand of her enemies .
24:12:008:0	My inheritance has become to MeLike a lion in the forest ; She has roared against Me ; Therefore I have come to hate her .
24:12:009:0	Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me ? Are the birds of prey against her on every side ? Go , gather all the beasts of the field , Bring them to devour !
24:12:010:0	Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard , They have trampled down My field ; They have made My pleasant fieldA desolate wilderness .
24:12:011:0	It has been made a desolation , Desolate , it mourns before Me ; The whole land has been made desolate , Because no man lays it to heart .
24:12:012:0	On all the bare heights in the wildernessDestroyers have come , For a sword of the Lord is devouringFrom one end of the land even to the other ; There is no peace for anyone .
24:12:013:0	They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns , They have strained themselves to no profit . But be ashamed of your harvestBecause of the fierce anger of the Lord . ”
24:12:014:0	Thus says the Lord concerning all My wicked neighbors who strike at the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel , “ Behold I am about to uproot them from their land and will uproot the house of Judah from among them .
24:12:015:0	And it will come about that after I have uprooted them , I will again have compassion on them ; and I will bring them back , each one to his inheritance and each one to his land .
24:12:016:0	Then if they will really learn the ways of My people , to swear by My name , ‘As the Lord lives , ’ even as they taught My people to swear by Baal , they will be built up in the midst of My people .
24:12:017:0	But if they will not listen , then I will uproot that nation , uproot and destroy it , ” declares the Lord .
