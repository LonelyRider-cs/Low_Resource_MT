24:52:001:1	The Fall of Jerusalem
24:52:001:0	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
24:52:002:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord like all that Jehoiakim had done .
24:52:003:0	For through the anger of the Lord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence . And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
24:52:004:0	Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign , on the tenth day of the tenth month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , camped against it and built a siege wall all around it .
24:52:005:0	So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
24:52:006:0	On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land .
24:52:007:0	Then the city was broken into , and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king’s garden , though the Chaldeans were all around the city . And they went by way of the Arabah .
24:52:008:0	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho , and all his army was scattered from him .
24:52:009:0	Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath , and he passed sentence on him .
24:52:010:0	The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
24:52:011:0	Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death .
24:52:012:0	Now on the tenth day of the fifth month , which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard , who was in the service of the king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem .
24:52:013:0	He burned the house of the Lord , the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem ; even every large house he burned with fire .
24:52:014:0	So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem .
24:52:015:0	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people , the rest of the people who were left in the city , the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the artisans .
24:52:016:0	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen .
24:52:017:0	Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the Lord and the stands and the bronze sea , which were in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon .
24:52:018:0	They also took away the pots , the shovels , the snuffers , the basins , the pans and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service .
24:52:019:0	The captain of the guard also took away the bowls , the firepans , the basins , the pots , the lampstands , the pans and the drink offering bowls , what was fine gold and what was fine silver .
24:52:020:0	The two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea , and the stands , which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord—the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight .
24:52:021:0	As for the pillars , the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits , and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness , and hollow .
24:52:022:0	Now a capital of bronze was on it ; and the height of each capital was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around , all of bronze . And the second pillar was like these , including pomegranates .
24:52:023:0	There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates ; all the pomegranates numbered a hundred on the network all around .
24:52:024:0	Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest , with the three officers of the temple .
24:52:025:0	He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war , and seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city , and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land , and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city .
24:52:026:0	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
24:52:027:0	Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . So Judah was led away into exile from its land .
24:52:028:0	These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile : in the seventh year 3 , 023 Jews ;
24:52:029:0	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem ;
24:52:030:0	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile 745 Jewish people ; there were 4 , 600 persons in all .
24:52:031:0	Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-fifth of the month , that Evil-merodach king of Babylon , in the first year of his reign , showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison .
24:52:032:0	Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon .
24:52:033:0	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes , and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life .
24:52:034:0	For his allowance , a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon , a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death .
