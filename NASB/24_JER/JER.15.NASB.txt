24:15:001:1	Judgment Must Come
24:15:001:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me , My heart would not be with this people ; send them away from My presence and let them go !
24:15:002:0	And it shall be that when they say to you , ‘Where should we go ? ’ then you are to tell them , ‘Thus says the Lord : “ Those destined for death , to death ; And those destined for the sword , to the sword ; And those destined for famine , to famine ; And those destined for captivity , to captivity . ” ’
24:15:003:0	I will appoint over them four kinds of doom , ” declares the Lord : “ the sword to slay , the dogs to drag off , and the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy .
24:15:004:0	I will make them an object of horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh , the son of Hezekiah , the king of Judah , for what he did in Jerusalem .
24:15:005:0	“ Indeed , who will have pity on you , O Jerusalem , Or who will mourn for you , Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare ?
24:15:006:0	You who have forsaken Me , ” declares the Lord , “ You keep going backward . So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you ; I am tired of relenting !
24:15:007:0	I will winnow them with a winnowing forkAt the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy My people ; They did not repent of their ways .
24:15:008:0	Their widows will be more numerous before MeThan the sand of the seas ; I will bring against them , against the mother of a young man , A destroyer at noonday ; I will suddenly bring down on herAnguish and dismay .
24:15:009:0	She who bore seven sons pines away ; Her breathing is labored . Her sun has set while it was yet day ; She has been shamed and humiliated . So I will give over their survivors to the swordBefore their enemies , ” declares the Lord .
24:15:010:0	Woe to me , my mother , that you have borne me As a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land ! I have not lent , nor have men lent money to me , Yet everyone curses me .
24:15:011:0	The Lord said , “ Surely I will set you free for purposes of good ; Surely I will cause the enemy to make supplication to youIn a time of disaster and a time of distress .
24:15:012:0	“ Can anyone smash iron , Iron from the north , or bronze ?
24:15:013:0	Your wealth and your treasuresI will give for booty without cost , Even for all your sinsAnd within all your borders .
24:15:002:1	Jeremiah’s Prayer and God’s Answer
24:15:014:0	Then I will cause your enemies to bring itInto a land you do not know ; For a fire has been kindled in My anger , It will burn upon you . ”
24:15:015:0	You who know , O Lord , Remember me , take notice of me , And take vengeance for me on my persecutors . Do not , in view of Your patience , take me away ; Know that for Your sake I endure reproach .
24:15:016:0	Your words were found and I ate them , And Your words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart ; For I have been called by Your name , O Lord God of hosts .
24:15:017:0	I did not sit in the circle of merrymakers , Nor did I exult . Because of Your hand upon me I sat alone , For You filled me with indignation .
24:15:018:0	Why has my pain been perpetualAnd my wound incurable , refusing to be healed ? Will You indeed be to me like a deceptive streamWith water that is unreliable ?
24:15:019:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord , “ If you return , then I will restore you—Before Me you will stand ; And if you extract the precious from the worthless , You will become My spokesman . They for their part may turn to you , But as for you , you must not turn to them .
24:15:020:0	Then I will make you to this peopleA fortified wall of bronze ; And though they fight against you , They will not prevail over you ; For I am with you to save youAnd deliver you , ” declares the Lord .
24:15:021:0	“ So I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked , And I will redeem you from the grasp of the violent . ”
