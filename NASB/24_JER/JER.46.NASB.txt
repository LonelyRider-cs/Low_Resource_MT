24:46:001:1	Defeat of Pharaoh Foretold
24:46:001:0	That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations .
24:46:002:0	To Egypt , concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt , which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah :
24:46:003:0	“ Line up the shield and buckler , And draw near for the battle !
24:46:004:0	Harness the horses , And mount the steeds , And take your stand with helmets on ! Polish the spears , Put on the scale-armor !
24:46:005:0	Why have I seen it ? They are terrified , They are drawing back , And their mighty men are defeatedAnd have taken refuge in flight , Without facing back ; Terror is on every side ! ” Declares the Lord .
24:46:006:0	Let not the swift man flee , Nor the mighty man escape ; In the north beside the river EuphratesThey have stumbled and fallen .
24:46:007:0	Who is this that rises like the Nile , Like the rivers whose waters surge about ?
24:46:008:0	Egypt rises like the Nile , Even like the rivers whose waters surge about ; And He has said , “ I will rise and cover that land ; I will surely destroy the city and its inhabitants . ”
24:46:009:0	Go up , you horses , and drive madly , you chariots , That the mighty men may march forward : Ethiopia and Put , that handle the shield , And the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
24:46:010:0	For that day belongs to the Lord God of hosts , A day of vengeance , so as to avenge Himself on His foes ; And the sword will devour and be satiatedAnd drink its fill of their blood ; For there will be a slaughter for the Lord God of hosts , In the land of the north by the river Euphrates .
24:46:011:0	Go up to Gilead and obtain balm , O virgin daughter of Egypt ! In vain have you multiplied remedies ; There is no healing for you .
24:46:012:0	The nations have heard of your shame , And the earth is full of your cry of distress ; For one warrior has stumbled over another , And both of them have fallen down together .
24:46:013:0	This is the message which the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt :
24:46:014:0	“ Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol , Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes ; Say , ‘Take your stand and get yourself ready , For the sword has devoured those around you . ’
24:46:015:0	Why have your mighty ones become prostrate ? They do not stand because the Lord has thrust them down .
24:46:016:0	They have repeatedly stumbled ; Indeed , they have fallen one against another . Then they said , ‘Get up ! And let us go backTo our own people and our native landAway from the sword of the oppressor . ’
24:46:017:0	They cried there , ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a big noise ; He has let the appointed time pass by ! ’
24:46:018:0	As I live , ” declares the KingWhose name is the Lord of hosts , “ Surely one shall come who looms up like Tabor among the mountains , Or like Carmel by the sea .
24:46:019:0	Make your baggage ready for exile , O daughter dwelling in Egypt , For Memphis will become a desolation ; It will even be burned down and bereft of inhabitants .
24:46:020:0	Egypt is a pretty heifer , But a horsefly is coming from the north—it is coming !
24:46:021:0	Also her mercenaries in her midstAre like fattened calves , For even they too have turned back and have fled away together ; They did not stand their ground . For the day of their calamity has come upon them , The time of their punishment .
24:46:022:0	Its sound moves along like a serpent ; For they move on like an armyAnd come to her as woodcutters with axes .
24:46:023:0	They have cut down her forest , ” declares the Lord ; “ Surely it will no more be found , Even though they are now more numerous than locustsAnd are without number .
24:46:024:0	The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame , Given over to the power of the people of the north . ”
24:46:025:0	The Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , says , “ Behold , I am going to punish Amon of Thebes , and Pharaoh , and Egypt along with her gods and her kings , even Pharaoh and those who trust in him .
24:46:026:0	I shall give them over to the power of those who are seeking their lives , even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his officers . Afterwards , however , it will be inhabited as in the days of old , ” declares the Lord .
24:46:027:0	“ But as for you , O Jacob My servant , do not fear , Nor be dismayed , O Israel ! For , see , I am going to save you from afar , And your descendants from the land of their captivity ; And Jacob will return and be undisturbedAnd secure , with no one making him tremble .
24:46:028:0	O Jacob My servant , do not fear , ” declares the Lord , “ For I am with you . For I will make a full end of all the nationsWhere I have driven you , Yet I will not make a full end of you ; But I will correct you properlyAnd by no means leave you unpunished . ”
