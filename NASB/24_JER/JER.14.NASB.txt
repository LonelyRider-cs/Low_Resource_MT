24:14:001:1	Drought and a Prayer for Mercy
24:14:001:0	That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah in regard to the drought :
24:14:002:0	“ Judah mournsAnd her gates languish ; They sit on the ground in mourning , And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended .
24:14:003:0	Their nobles have sent their servants for water ; They have come to the cisterns and found no water . They have returned with their vessels empty ; They have been put to shame and humiliated , And they cover their heads .
24:14:004:0	Because the ground is cracked , For there has been no rain on the land ; The farmers have been put to shame , They have covered their heads .
24:14:005:0	For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon her young , Because there is no grass .
24:14:006:0	The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights ; They pant for air like jackals , Their eyes failFor there is no vegetation .
24:14:007:0	Although our iniquities testify against us , O Lord , act for Your name’s sake ! Truly our apostasies have been many , We have sinned against You .
24:14:008:0	O Hope of Israel , Its Savior in time of distress , Why are You like a stranger in the landOr like a traveler who has pitched his tent for the night ?
24:14:009:0	Why are You like a man dismayed , Like a mighty man who cannot save ? Yet You are in our midst , O Lord , And we are called by Your name ; Do not forsake us ! ”
24:14:010:0	Thus says the Lord to this people , “ Even so they have loved to wander ; they have not kept their feet in check . Therefore the Lord does not accept them ; now He will remember their iniquity and call their sins to account . ”
24:14:011:0	So the Lord said to me , “ Do not pray for the welfare of this people .
24:14:002:1	False Prophets
24:14:012:0	When they fast , I am not going to listen to their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering , I am not going to accept them . Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword , famine and pestilence . ”
24:14:013:0	But , “ Ah , Lord God ! ” I said , “ Look , the prophets are telling them , ‘You will not see the sword nor will you have famine , but I will give you lasting peace in this place . ’ ”
24:14:014:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name . I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them ; they are prophesying to you a false vision , divination , futility and the deception of their own minds .
24:14:015:0	Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name , although it was not I who sent them—yet they keep saying , ‘There will be no sword or famine in this land’—by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end !
24:14:016:0	The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and there will be no one to bury them—neither them , nor their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters—for I will pour out their own wickedness on them .
24:14:017:0	You will say this word to them , ‘Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day , And let them not cease ; For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow , With a sorely infected wound .
24:14:018:0	If I go out to the country , Behold , those slain with the sword ! Or if I enter the city , Behold , diseases of famine ! For both prophet and priestHave gone roving about in the land that they do not know . ’ ”
24:14:019:0	Have You completely rejected Judah ? Or have You loathed Zion ? Why have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing ? We waited for peace , but nothing good came ; And for a time of healing , but behold , terror !
24:14:020:0	We know our wickedness , O Lord , The iniquity of our fathers , for we have sinned against You .
24:14:021:0	Do not despise us , for Your own name’s sake ; Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory ; Remember and do not annul Your covenant with us .
24:14:022:0	Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain ? Or can the heavens grant showers ? Is it not You , O Lord our God ? Therefore we hope in You , For You are the one who has done all these things .
