24:5:001:1	Jerusalem’s Godlessness
24:5:001:0	“ Roam to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem , And look now and take note . And seek in her open squares , If you can find a man , If there is one who does justice , who seeks truth , Then I will pardon her .
24:5:002:0	And although they say , ‘As the Lord lives , ’Surely they swear falsely . ”
24:5:003:0	O Lord , do not Your eyes look for truth ? You have smitten them , But they did not weaken ; You have consumed them , But they refused to take correction . They have made their faces harder than rock ; They have refused to repent .
24:5:004:0	Then I said , “ They are only the poor , They are foolish ; For they do not know the way of the Lord Or the ordinance of their God .
24:5:005:0	I will go to the greatAnd will speak to them , For they know the way of the Lord And the ordinance of their God . ” But they too , with one accord , have broken the yoke And burst the bonds .
24:5:006:0	Therefore a lion from the forest will slay them , A wolf of the deserts will destroy them , A leopard is watching their cities . Everyone who goes out of them will be torn in pieces , Because their transgressions are many , Their apostasies are numerous .
24:5:007:0	“ Why should I pardon you ? Your sons have forsaken MeAnd sworn by those who are not gods . When I had fed them to the full , They committed adulteryAnd trooped to the harlot’s house .
24:5:008:0	They were well-fed lusty horses , Each one neighing after his neighbor’s wife .
24:5:009:0	Shall I not punish these people , ” declares the Lord , “ And on a nation such as thisShall I not avenge Myself ?
24:5:010:0	“ Go up through her vine rows and destroy , But do not execute a complete destruction ; Strip away her branches , For they are not the Lord’s .
24:5:011:0	For the house of Israel and the house of JudahHave dealt very treacherously with Me , ” declares the Lord .
24:5:012:0	They have lied about the LordAnd said , “ Not He ; Misfortune will not come on us , And we will not see sword or famine .
24:5:002:1	Judgment Proclaimed
24:5:013:0	The prophets are as wind , And the word is not in them . Thus it will be done to them ! ”
24:5:014:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord , the God of hosts , “ Because you have spoken this word , Behold , I am making My words in your mouth fireAnd this people wood , and it will consume them .
24:5:015:0	Behold , I am bringing a nation against you from afar , O house of Israel , ” declares the Lord . “ It is an enduring nation , It is an ancient nation , A nation whose language you do not know , Nor can you understand what they say .
24:5:016:0	Their quiver is like an open grave , All of them are mighty men .
24:5:017:0	They will devour your harvest and your food ; They will devour your sons and your daughters ; They will devour your flocks and your herds ; They will devour your vines and your fig trees ; They will demolish with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust .
24:5:018:0	“ Yet even in those days , ” declares the Lord , “ I will not make you a complete destruction .
24:5:019:0	It shall come about when they say , ‘Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us ? ’ then you shall say to them , ‘As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land , so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours . ’
24:5:020:0	“ Declare this in the house of JacobAnd proclaim it in Judah , saying ,
24:5:021:0	‘Now hear this , O foolish and senseless people , Who have eyes but do not see ; Who have ears but do not hear .
24:5:022:0	Do you not fear Me ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘Do you not tremble in My presence ? For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea , An eternal decree , so it cannot cross over it . Though the waves toss , yet they cannot prevail ; Though they roar , yet they cannot cross over it .
24:5:023:0	But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart ; They have turned aside and departed .
24:5:024:0	They do not say in their heart , “ Let us now fear the Lord our God , Who gives rain in its season , Both the autumn rain and the spring rain , Who keeps for usThe appointed weeks of the harvest . ”
24:5:025:0	Your iniquities have turned these away , And your sins have withheld good from you .
24:5:026:0	For wicked men are found among My people , They watch like fowlers lying in wait ; They set a trap , They catch men .
24:5:027:0	Like a cage full of birds , So their houses are full of deceit ; Therefore they have become great and rich .
24:5:028:0	They are fat , they are sleek , They also excel in deeds of wickedness ; They do not plead the cause , The cause of the orphan , that they may prosper ; And they do not defend the rights of the poor .
24:5:029:0	Shall I not punish these people ? ’ declares the Lord , ‘On a nation such as thisShall I not avenge Myself ? ’
24:5:030:0	“ An appalling and horrible thingHas happened in the land :
24:5:031:0	The prophets prophesy falsely , And the priests rule on their own authority ; And My people love it so ! But what will you do at the end of it ?
