24:47:001:1	Prophecy against Philistia
24:47:001:0	That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines , before Pharaoh conquered Gaza .
24:47:002:0	Thus says the Lord : “ Behold , waters are going to rise from the northAnd become an overflowing torrent , And overflow the land and all its fullness , The city and those who live in it ; And the men will cry out , And every inhabitant of the land will wail .
24:47:003:0	Because of the noise of the galloping hoofs of his stallions , The tumult of his chariots , and the rumbling of his wheels , The fathers have not turned back for their children , Because of the limpness of their hands ,
24:47:004:0	On account of the day that is comingTo destroy all the Philistines , To cut off from Tyre and SidonEvery ally that is left ; For the Lord is going to destroy the Philistines , The remnant of the coastland of Caphtor .
24:47:005:0	Baldness has come upon Gaza ; Ashkelon has been ruined . O remnant of their valley , How long will you gash yourself ?
24:47:006:0	Ah , sword of the Lord , How long will you not be quiet ? Withdraw into your sheath ; Be at rest and stay still .
24:47:007:0	How can it be quiet , When the Lord has given it an order ? Against Ashkelon and against the seacoast—There He has assigned it . ”
