24:8:001:1	The Sin and Treachery of Judah
24:8:001:0	“ At that time , ” declares the Lord , “ they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of its princes , and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves .
24:8:002:0	They will spread them out to the sun , the moon and to all the host of heaven , which they have loved and which they have served , and which they have gone after and which they have sought , and which they have worshiped . They will not be gathered or buried ; they will be as dung on the face of the ground .
24:8:003:0	And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family , that remains in all the places to which I have driven them , ” declares the Lord of hosts .
24:8:004:0	“ You shall say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Do men fall and not get up again ? Does one turn away and not repent ?
24:8:005:0	Why then has this people , Jerusalem , Turned away in continual apostasy ? They hold fast to deceit , They refuse to return .
24:8:006:0	I have listened and heard , They have spoken what is not right ; No man repented of his wickedness , Saying , ‘What have I done ? ’Everyone turned to his course , Like a horse charging into the battle .
24:8:007:0	Even the stork in the skyKnows her seasons ; And the turtledove and the swift and the thrushObserve the time of their migration ; But My people do not knowThe ordinance of the Lord .
24:8:008:0	“ How can you say , ‘We are wise , And the law of the Lord is with us’ ? But behold , the lying pen of the scribesHas made it into a lie .
24:8:009:0	The wise men are put to shame , They are dismayed and caught ; Behold , they have rejected the word of the Lord , And what kind of wisdom do they have ?
24:8:010:0	Therefore I will give their wives to others , Their fields to new owners ; Because from the least even to the greatestEveryone is greedy for gain ; From the prophet even to the priestEveryone practices deceit .
24:8:011:0	They heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially , Saying , ‘Peace , peace , ’But there is no peace .
24:8:012:0	Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done ? They certainly were not ashamed , And they did not know how to blush ; Therefore they shall fall among those who fall ; At the time of their punishment they shall be brought down , ” Says the Lord .
24:8:013:0	“ I will surely snatch them away , ” declares the Lord ; “ There will be no grapes on the vineAnd no figs on the fig tree , And the leaf will wither ; And what I have given them will pass away . ” ’ ”
24:8:014:0	Why are we sitting still ? Assemble yourselves , and let us go into the fortified citiesAnd let us perish there , Because the Lord our God has doomed usAnd given us poisoned water to drink , For we have sinned against the Lord .
24:8:015:0	We waited for peace , but no good came ; For a time of healing , but behold , terror !
24:8:016:0	From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses ; At the sound of the neighing of his stallionsThe whole land quakes ; For they come and devour the land and its fullness , The city and its inhabitants .
24:8:017:0	“ For behold , I am sending serpents against you , Adders , for which there is no charm , And they will bite you , ” declares the Lord .
24:8:018:0	My sorrow is beyond healing , My heart is faint within me !
24:8:019:0	Behold , listen ! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land : “ Is the Lord not in Zion ? Is her King not within her ? ” “ Why have they provoked Me with their graven images , with foreign idols ? ”
24:8:020:0	“ Harvest is past , summer is ended , And we are not saved . ”
24:8:021:0	For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken ; I mourn , dismay has taken hold of me .
24:8:022:0	Is there no balm in Gilead ? Is there no physician there ? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored ?
