24:51:001:1	Babylon Judged for Sins against Israel
24:51:001:0	Thus says the Lord : “ Behold , I am going to arouse against BabylonAnd against the inhabitants of Leb-kamaiThe spirit of a destroyer .
24:51:002:0	I will dispatch foreigners to Babylon that they may winnow herAnd may devastate her land ; For on every side they will be opposed to herIn the day of her calamity .
24:51:003:0	Let not him who bends his bow bend it , Nor let him rise up in his scale-armor ; So do not spare her young men ; Devote all her army to destruction .
24:51:004:0	They will fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans , And pierced through in their streets . ”
24:51:005:0	For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsakenBy his God , the Lord of hosts , Although their land is full of guiltBefore the Holy One of Israel .
24:51:006:0	Flee from the midst of Babylon , And each of you save his life ! Do not be destroyed in her punishment , For this is the Lord’s time of vengeance ; He is going to render recompense to her .
24:51:007:0	Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord , Intoxicating all the earth . The nations have drunk of her wine ; Therefore the nations are going mad .
24:51:008:0	Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken ; Wail over her ! Bring balm for her pain ; Perhaps she may be healed .
24:51:009:0	We applied healing to Babylon , but she was not healed ; Forsake her and let us each go to his own country , For her judgment has reached to heavenAnd towers up to the very skies .
24:51:010:0	The Lord has brought about our vindication ; Come and let us recount in ZionThe work of the Lord our God !
24:51:011:0	Sharpen the arrows , fill the quivers ! The Lord has aroused the spirit of the kings of the Medes , Because His purpose is against Babylon to destroy it ; For it is the vengeance of the Lord , vengeance for His temple .
24:51:012:0	Lift up a signal against the walls of Babylon ; Post a strong guard , Station sentries , Place men in ambush ! For the Lord has both purposed and performedWhat He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon .
24:51:013:0	O you who dwell by many waters , Abundant in treasures , Your end has come , The measure of your end .
24:51:014:0	The Lord of hosts has sworn by Himself : “ Surely I will fill you with a population like locusts , And they will cry out with shouts of victory over you . ”
24:51:015:0	It is He who made the earth by His power , Who established the world by His wisdom , And by His understanding He stretched out the heavens .
24:51:016:0	When He utters His voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth ; He makes lightning for the rainAnd brings forth the wind from His storehouses .
24:51:017:0	All mankind is stupid , devoid of knowledge ; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols , For his molten images are deceitful , And there is no breath in them .
24:51:018:0	They are worthless , a work of mockery ; In the time of their punishment they will perish .
24:51:019:0	The portion of Jacob is not like these ; For the Maker of all is He , And of the tribe of His inheritance ; The Lord of hosts is His name .
24:51:020:0	He says , “ You are My war-club , My weapon of war ; And with you I shatter nations , And with you I destroy kingdoms .
24:51:021:0	With you I shatter the horse and his rider , And with you I shatter the chariot and its rider ,
24:51:022:0	And with you I shatter man and woman , And with you I shatter old man and youth , And with you I shatter young man and virgin ,
24:51:023:0	And with you I shatter the shepherd and his flock , And with you I shatter the farmer and his team , And with you I shatter governors and prefects .
24:51:024:0	“ But I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes , ” declares the Lord .
24:51:025:0	“ Behold , I am against you , O destroying mountain , Who destroys the whole earth , ” declares the Lord , “ And I will stretch out My hand against you , And roll you down from the crags , And I will make you a burnt out mountain .
24:51:026:0	They will not take from you even a stone for a cornerNor a stone for foundations , But you will be desolate forever , ” declares the Lord .
24:51:027:0	Lift up a signal in the land , Blow a trumpet among the nations ! Consecrate the nations against her , Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni and Ashkenaz ; Appoint a marshal against her , Bring up the horses like bristly locusts .
24:51:028:0	Consecrate the nations against her , The kings of the Medes , Their governors and all their prefects , And every land of their dominion .
24:51:029:0	So the land quakes and writhes , For the purposes of the Lord against Babylon stand , To make the land of BabylonA desolation without inhabitants .
24:51:030:0	The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting , They stay in the strongholds ; Their strength is exhausted , They are becoming like women ; Their dwelling places are set on fire , The bars of her gates are broken .
24:51:031:0	One courier runs to meet another , And one messenger to meet another , To tell the king of BabylonThat his city has been captured from end to end ;
24:51:032:0	The fords also have been seized , And they have burned the marshes with fire , And the men of war are terrified .
24:51:033:0	For thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel : “ The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floorAt the time it is stamped firm ; Yet in a little while the time of harvest will come for her . ”
24:51:034:0	“ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me and crushed me , He has set me down like an empty vessel ; He has swallowed me like a monster , He has filled his stomach with my delicacies ; He has washed me away .
24:51:035:0	May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , ” The inhabitant of Zion will say ; And , “ May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea , ” Jerusalem will say .
24:51:036:0	Therefore thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I am going to plead your caseAnd exact full vengeance for you ; And I will dry up her seaAnd make her fountain dry .
24:51:037:0	Babylon will become a heap of ruins , a haunt of jackals , An object of horror and hissing , without inhabitants .
24:51:038:0	They will roar together like young lions , They will growl like lions’ cubs .
24:51:039:0	When they become heated up , I will serve them their banquetAnd make them drunk , that they may become jubilantAnd may sleep a perpetual sleepAnd not wake up , ” declares the Lord .
24:51:040:0	“ I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , Like rams together with male goats .
24:51:041:0	“ How Sheshak has been captured , And the praise of the whole earth been seized ! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations !
24:51:042:0	The sea has come up over Babylon ; She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves .
24:51:043:0	Her cities have become an object of horror , A parched land and a desert , A land in which no man livesAnd through which no son of man passes .
24:51:044:0	I will punish Bel in Babylon , And I will make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth ; And the nations will no longer stream to him . Even the wall of Babylon has fallen down !
24:51:045:0	“ Come forth from her midst , My people , And each of you save yourselvesFrom the fierce anger of the Lord .
24:51:046:0	Now so that your heart does not grow faint , And you are not afraid at the report that will be heard in the land—For the report will come one year , And after that another report in another year , And violence will be in the landWith ruler against ruler—
24:51:047:0	Therefore behold , days are comingWhen I will punish the idols of Babylon ; And her whole land will be put to shameAnd all her slain will fall in her midst .
24:51:048:0	Then heaven and earth and all that is in themWill shout for joy over Babylon , For the destroyers will come to her from the north , ” Declares the Lord .
24:51:049:0	Indeed Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel , As also for Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen .
24:51:050:0	You who have escaped the sword , Depart ! Do not stay ! Remember the Lord from afar , And let Jerusalem come to your mind .
24:51:051:0	We are ashamed because we have heard reproach ; Disgrace has covered our faces , For aliens have enteredThe holy places of the Lord’s house .
24:51:052:0	“ Therefore behold , the days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ When I will punish her idols , And the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land .
24:51:053:0	Though Babylon should ascend to the heavens , And though she should fortify her lofty stronghold , From Me destroyers will come to her , ” declares the Lord .
24:51:054:0	The sound of an outcry from Babylon , And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans !
24:51:055:0	For the Lord is going to destroy Babylon , And He will make her loud noise vanish from her . And their waves will roar like many waters ; The tumult of their voices sounds forth .
24:51:056:0	For the destroyer is coming against her , against Babylon , And her mighty men will be captured , Their bows are shattered ; For the Lord is a God of recompense , He will fully repay .
24:51:057:0	“ I will make her princes and her wise men drunk , Her governors , her prefects and her mighty men , That they may sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up , ” Declares the King , whose name is the Lord of hosts .
24:51:058:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ The broad wall of Babylon will be completely razedAnd her high gates will be set on fire ; So the peoples will toil for nothing , And the nations become exhausted only for fire . ”
24:51:059:0	The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah , the grandson of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . ( Now Seraiah was quartermaster . )
24:51:060:0	So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon , that is , all these words which have been written concerning Babylon .
24:51:061:0	Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah , “ As soon as you come to Babylon , then see that you read all these words aloud ,
24:51:062:0	and say , ‘You , O Lord , have promised concerning this place to cut it off , so that there will be nothing dwelling in it , whether man or beast , but it will be a perpetual desolation . ’
24:51:063:0	And as soon as you finish reading this scroll , you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates ,
24:51:064:0	and say , ‘Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her ; and they will become exhausted . ’ ” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah .
