24:49:001:1	Prophecy against Ammon
24:49:001:0	Concerning the sons of Ammon . Thus says the Lord : “ Does Israel have no sons ? Or has he no heirs ? Why then has Malcam taken possession of GadAnd his people settled in its cities ?
24:49:002:0	Therefore behold , the days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ That I will cause a trumpet blast of war to be heardAgainst Rabbah of the sons of Ammon ; And it will become a desolate heap , And her towns will be set on fire . Then Israel will take possession of his possessors , ” Says the Lord .
24:49:003:0	“ Wail , O Heshbon , for Ai has been destroyed ! Cry out , O daughters of Rabbah , Gird yourselves with sackcloth and lament , And rush back and forth inside the walls ; For Malcam will go into exileTogether with his priests and his princes .
24:49:004:0	How boastful you are about the valleys ! Your valley is flowing away , O backsliding daughterWho trusts in her treasures , saying , ‘Who will come against me ? ’
24:49:005:0	Behold , I am going to bring terror upon you , ” Declares the Lord God of hosts , “ From all directions around you ; And each of you will be driven out headlong , With no one to gather the fugitives together .
24:49:002:1	Prophecy against Edom
24:49:006:0	But afterward I will restoreThe fortunes of the sons of Ammon , ” Declares the Lord .
24:49:007:0	Concerning Edom . Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Is there no longer any wisdom in Teman ? Has good counsel been lost to the prudent ? Has their wisdom decayed ?
24:49:008:0	Flee away , turn back , dwell in the depths , O inhabitants of Dedan , For I will bring the disaster of Esau upon himAt the time I punish him .
24:49:009:0	If grape gatherers came to you , Would they not leave gleanings ? If thieves came by night , They would destroy only until they had enough .
24:49:010:0	But I have stripped Esau bare , I have uncovered his hiding placesSo that he will not be able to conceal himself ; His offspring has been destroyed along with his relativesAnd his neighbors , and he is no more .
24:49:011:0	Leave your orphans behind , I will keep them alive ; And let your widows trust in Me . ”
24:49:012:0	For thus says the Lord , “ Behold , those who were not sentenced to drink the cup will certainly drink it , and are you the one who will be completely acquitted ? You will not be acquitted , but you will certainly drink it .
24:49:013:0	For I have sworn by Myself , ” declares the Lord , “ that Bozrah will become an object of horror , a reproach , a ruin and a curse ; and all its cities will become perpetual ruins . ”
24:49:014:0	I have heard a message from the Lord , And an envoy is sent among the nations , saying , “ Gather yourselves together and come against her , And rise up for battle ! ”
24:49:015:0	“ For behold , I have made you small among the nations , Despised among men .
24:49:016:0	As for the terror of you , The arrogance of your heart has deceived you , O you who live in the clefts of the rock , Who occupy the height of the hill . Though you make your nest as high as an eagle’s , I will bring you down from there , ” declares the Lord .
24:49:017:0	“ Edom will become an object of horror ; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss at all its wounds .
24:49:018:0	Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with its neighbors , ” says the Lord , “ no one will live there , nor will a son of man reside in it .
24:49:019:0	Behold , one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan against a perennially watered pasture ; for in an instant I will make him run away from it , and whoever is chosen I shall appoint over it . For who is like Me , and who will summon Me into court ? And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me ? ”
24:49:020:0	Therefore hear the plan of the Lord which He has planned against Edom , and His purposes which He has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely they will drag them off , even the little ones of the flock ; surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them .
24:49:021:0	The earth has quaked at the noise of their downfall . There is an outcry ! The noise of it has been heard at the Red Sea .
24:49:003:1	Prophecy against Damascus
24:49:022:0	Behold , He will mount up and swoop like an eagle and spread out His wings against Bozrah ; and the hearts of the mighty men of Edom in that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor .
24:49:023:0	Concerning Damascus . “ Hamath and Arpad are put to shame , For they have heard bad news ; They are disheartened . There is anxiety by the sea , It cannot be calmed .
24:49:024:0	Damascus has become helpless ; She has turned away to flee , And panic has gripped her ; Distress and pangs have taken hold of herLike a woman in childbirth .
24:49:025:0	How the city of praise has not been deserted , The town of My joy !
24:49:026:0	Therefore , her young men will fall in her streets , And all the men of war will be silenced in that day , ” declares the Lord of hosts .
24:49:004:1	Prophecy against Kedar and Hazor
24:49:027:0	“ I will set fire to the wall of Damascus , And it will devour the fortified towers of Ben-hadad . ”
24:49:028:0	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated . Thus says the Lord , “ Arise , go up to KedarAnd devastate the men of the east .
24:49:029:0	They will take away their tents and their flocks ; They will carry off for themselvesTheir tent curtains , all their goods and their camels , And they will call out to one another , ‘Terror on every side ! ’
24:49:030:0	Run away , flee ! Dwell in the depths , O inhabitants of Hazor , ” declares the Lord ; “ For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has formed a plan against youAnd devised a scheme against you .
24:49:031:0	Arise , go up against a nation which is at ease , Which lives securely , ” declares the Lord . “ It has no gates or bars ; They dwell alone .
24:49:032:0	Their camels will become plunder , And their many cattle for booty , And I will scatter to all the winds those who cut the corners of their hair ; And I will bring their disaster from every side , ” declares the Lord .
24:49:005:1	Prophecy against Elam
24:49:033:0	“ Hazor will become a haunt of jackals , A desolation forever ; No one will live there , Nor will a son of man reside in it . ”
24:49:034:0	That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam , at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying :
24:49:035:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Behold , I am going to break the bow of Elam , The finest of their might .
24:49:036:0	I will bring upon Elam the four windsFrom the four ends of heaven , And will scatter them to all these winds ; And there will be no nationTo which the outcasts of Elam will not go .
24:49:037:0	So I will shatter Elam before their enemiesAnd before those who seek their lives ; And I will bring calamity upon them , Even My fierce anger , ’ declares the Lord , ‘And I will send out the sword after themUntil I have consumed them .
24:49:038:0	Then I will set My throne in ElamAnd destroy out of it king and princes , ’Declares the Lord .
24:49:039:0	‘But it will come about in the last daysThat I will restore the fortunes of Elam , ’ ” Declares the Lord .
