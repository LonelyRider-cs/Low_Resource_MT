24:39:001:1	Jerusalem Captured
24:39:001:0	Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it ;
24:39:002:0	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the city wall was breached .
24:39:003:0	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate : Nergal-sar-ezer , Samgar-nebu , Sar-sekim the Rab-saris , Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag , and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon .
24:39:004:0	When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls ; and he went out toward the Arabah .
24:39:005:0	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath , and he passed sentence on him .
24:39:006:0	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah ; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah .
24:39:007:0	He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon .
24:39:008:0	The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king’s palace and the houses of the people , and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
24:39:009:0	As for the rest of the people who were left in the city , the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained , Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried them into exile in Babylon .
24:39:002:1	Jeremiah Spared
24:39:010:0	But some of the poorest people who had nothing , Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at that time .
24:39:011:0	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard , saying ,
24:39:012:0	“ Take him and look after him , and do nothing harmful to him , but rather deal with him just as he tells you . ”
24:39:013:0	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word , along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris , and Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag , and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon ;
24:39:014:0	they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , to take him home . So he stayed among the people .
24:39:015:0	Now the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guardhouse , saying ,
24:39:016:0	“ Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , “ Behold , I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity ; and they will take place before you on that day .
24:39:017:0	But I will deliver you on that day , ” declares the Lord , “ and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread .
24:39:018:0	For I will certainly rescue you , and you will not fall by the sword ; but you will have your own life as booty , because you have trusted in Me , ” declares the Lord . ’ ”
