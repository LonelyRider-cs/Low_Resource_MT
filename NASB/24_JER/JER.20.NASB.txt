24:20:001:1	Pashhur Persecutes Jeremiah
24:20:001:0	When Pashhur the priest , the son of Immer , who was chief officer in the house of the Lord , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things ,
24:20:002:0	Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate , which was by the house of the Lord .
24:20:003:0	On the next day , when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks , Jeremiah said to him , “ Pashhur is not the name the Lord has called you , but rather Magor-missabib .
24:20:004:0	For thus says the Lord , ‘Behold , I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends ; and while your eyes look on , they will fall by the sword of their enemies . So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon , and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword .
24:20:005:0	I will also give over all the wealth of this city , all its produce and all its costly things ; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of their enemies , and they will plunder them , take them away and bring them to Babylon .
24:20:002:1	Jeremiah’s Complaint
24:20:006:0	And you , Pashhur , and all who live in your house will go into captivity ; and you will enter Babylon , and there you will die and there you will be buried , you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied . ’ ”
24:20:007:0	O Lord , You have deceived me and I was deceived ; You have overcome me and prevailed . I have become a laughingstock all day long ; Everyone mocks me .
24:20:008:0	For each time I speak , I cry aloud ; I proclaim violence and destruction , Because for me the word of the Lord has resultedIn reproach and derision all day long .
24:20:009:0	But if I say , “ I will not remember HimOr speak anymore in His name , ” Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fireShut up in my bones ; And I am weary of holding it in , And I cannot endure it .
24:20:010:0	For I have heard the whispering of many , “ Terror on every side ! Denounce him ; yes , let us denounce him ! ” All my trusted friends , Watching for my fall , say : “ Perhaps he will be deceived , so that we may prevail against himAnd take our revenge on him . ”
24:20:011:0	But the Lord is with me like a dread champion ; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail . They will be utterly ashamed , because they have failed , With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten .
24:20:012:0	Yet , O Lord of hosts , You who test the righteous , Who see the mind and the heart ; Let me see Your vengeance on them ; For to You I have set forth my cause .
24:20:013:0	Sing to the Lord , praise the Lord ! For He has delivered the soul of the needy oneFrom the hand of evildoers .
24:20:014:0	Cursed be the day when I was born ; Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me !
24:20:015:0	Cursed be the man who brought the newsTo my father , saying , “ A baby boy has been born to you ! ” And made him very happy .
24:20:016:0	But let that man be like the citiesWhich the Lord overthrew without relenting , And let him hear an outcry in the morningAnd a shout of alarm at noon ;
24:20:017:0	Because he did not kill me before birth , So that my mother would have been my grave , And her womb ever pregnant .
24:20:018:0	Why did I ever come forth from the wombTo look on trouble and sorrow , So that my days have been spent in shame ?
