27:8:001:1	Vision of the Ram and Goat
27:8:001:0	In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me , Daniel , subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously .
27:8:002:0	I looked in the vision , and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa , which is in the province of Elam ; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal .
27:8:003:0	Then I lifted my eyes and looked , and behold , a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal . Now the two horns were long , but one was longer than the other , with the longer one coming up last .
27:8:004:0	I saw the ram butting westward , northward , and southward , and no other beasts could stand before him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power , but he did as he pleased and magnified himself .
27:8:005:0	While I was observing , behold , a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground ; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes .
27:8:006:0	He came up to the ram that had the two horns , which I had seen standing in front of the canal , and rushed at him in his mighty wrath .
27:8:007:0	I saw him come beside the ram , and he was enraged at him ; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns , and the ram had no strength to withstand him . So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him , and there was none to rescue the ram from his power .
27:8:002:1	The Little Horn
27:8:008:0	Then the male goat magnified himself exceedingly . But as soon as he was mighty , the large horn was broken ; and in its place there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven .
27:8:009:0	Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south , toward the east , and toward the Beautiful Land .
27:8:010:0	It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth , and it trampled them down .
27:8:011:0	It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander of the host ; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him , and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down .
27:8:012:0	And on account of transgression the host will be given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice ; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform its will and prosper .
27:8:013:0	Then I heard a holy one speaking , and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking , “ How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply , while the transgression causes horror , so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled ? ”
27:8:003:1	Interpretation of the Vision
27:8:014:0	He said to me , “ For 2 , 300 evenings and mornings ; then the holy place will be properly restored . ”
27:8:015:0	When I , Daniel , had seen the vision , I sought to understand it ; and behold , standing before me was one who looked like a man .
27:8:016:0	And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai , and he called out and said , “ Gabriel , give this man an understanding of the vision . ”
27:8:017:0	So he came near to where I was standing , and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face ; but he said to me , “ Son of man , understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end . ”
27:8:018:0	Now while he was talking with me , I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground ; but he touched me and made me stand upright .
27:8:004:1	The Ram’s Identity
27:8:019:0	He said , “ Behold , I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation , for it pertains to the appointed time of the end .
27:8:005:1	The Goat
27:8:020:0	The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia .
27:8:021:0	The shaggy goat represents the kingdom of Greece , and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
27:8:022:0	The broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place represent four kingdoms which will arise from his nation , although not with his power .
27:8:023:0	In the latter period of their rule , When the transgressors have run their course , A king will arise , Insolent and skilled in intrigue .
27:8:024:0	His power will be mighty , but not by his own power , And he will destroy to an extraordinary degreeAnd prosper and perform his will ; He will destroy mighty men and the holy people .
27:8:025:0	And through his shrewdnessHe will cause deceit to succeed by his influence ; And he will magnify himself in his heart , And he will destroy many while they are at ease . He will even oppose the Prince of princes , But he will be broken without human agency .
27:8:026:0	The vision of the evenings and morningsWhich has been told is true ; But keep the vision secret , For it pertains to many days in the future . ”
27:8:027:0	Then I , Daniel , was exhausted and sick for days . Then I got up again and carried on the king’s business ; but I was astounded at the vision , and there was none to explain it .
