27:7:001:1	Vision of the Four Beasts
27:7:001:0	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed ; then he wrote the dream down and related the following summary of it .
27:7:002:0	Daniel said , “ I was looking in my vision by night , and behold , the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea .
27:7:003:0	And four great beasts were coming up from the sea , different from one another .
27:7:004:0	The first was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle . I kept looking until its wings were plucked , and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man ; a human mind also was given to it .
27:7:005:0	And behold , another beast , a second one , resembling a bear . And it was raised up on one side , and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth ; and thus they said to it , ‘Arise , devour much meat ! ’
27:7:006:0	After this I kept looking , and behold , another one , like a leopard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the beast also had four heads , and dominion was given to it .
27:7:007:0	After this I kept looking in the night visions , and behold , a fourth beast , dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong ; and it had large iron teeth . It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet ; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it , and it had ten horns .
27:7:002:1	The Ancient of Days Reigns
27:7:008:0	While I was contemplating the horns , behold , another horn , a little one , came up among them , and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it ; and behold , this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts .
27:7:009:0	“ I kept lookingUntil thrones were set up , And the Ancient of Days took His seat ; His vesture was like white snowAnd the hair of His head like pure wool . His throne was ablaze with flames , Its wheels were a burning fire .
27:7:010:0	A river of fire was flowingAnd coming out from before Him ; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him , And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him ; The court sat , And the books were opened .
27:7:011:0	Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking ; I kept looking until the beast was slain , and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire .
27:7:003:1	The Son of Man Presented
27:7:012:0	As for the rest of the beasts , their dominion was taken away , but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time .
27:7:013:0	“ I kept looking in the night visions , And behold , with the clouds of heavenOne like a Son of Man was coming , And He came up to the Ancient of DaysAnd was presented before Him .
27:7:004:1	The Vision Interpreted
27:7:014:0	And to Him was given dominion , Glory and a kingdom , That all the peoples , nations and men of every languageMight serve Him . His dominion is an everlasting dominionWhich will not pass away ; And His kingdom is oneWhich will not be destroyed .
27:7:015:0	“ As for me , Daniel , my spirit was distressed within me , and the visions in my mind kept alarming me .
27:7:016:0	I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this . So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things :
27:7:017:0	‘These great beasts , which are four in number , are four kings who will arise from the earth .
27:7:018:0	But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever , for all ages to come . ’
27:7:019:0	“ Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast , which was different from all the others , exceedingly dreadful , with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze , and which devoured , crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet ,
27:7:020:0	and the meaning of the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up , and before which three of them fell , namely , that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great boasts and which was larger in appearance than its associates .
27:7:021:0	I kept looking , and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them
27:7:022:0	until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One , and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom .
27:7:023:0	“ Thus he said : ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth , which will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it .
27:7:024:0	As for the ten horns , out of this kingdom ten kings will arise ; and another will arise after them , and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings .
27:7:025:0	He will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One , and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law ; and they will be given into his hand for a time , times , and half a time .
27:7:026:0	But the court will sit for judgment , and his dominion will be taken away , annihilated and destroyed forever .
27:7:027:0	Then the sovereignty , the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One ; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom , and all the dominions will serve and obey Him . ’
27:7:028:0	“ At this point the revelation ended . As for me , Daniel , my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale , but I kept the matter to myself . ”
