27:4:001:1	The King Acknowledges God
27:4:001:0	Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples , nations , and men of every language that live in all the earth : “ May your peace abound !
27:4:002:0	It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me .
27:4:002:1	The Vision of a Great Tree
27:4:003:0	How great are His signsAnd how mighty are His wonders ! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdomAnd His dominion is from generation to generation .
27:4:004:0	“ I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace .
27:4:005:0	I saw a dream and it made me fearful ; and these fantasies as I lay on my bed and the visions in my mind kept alarming me .
27:4:006:0	So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
27:4:007:0	Then the magicians , the conjurers , the Chaldeans and the diviners came in and I related the dream to them , but they could not make its interpretation known to me .
27:4:008:0	But finally Daniel came in before me , whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god , and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods ; and I related the dream to him , saying ,
27:4:009:0	‘O Belteshazzar , chief of the magicians , since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you , tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen , along with its interpretation .
27:4:010:0	‘Now these were the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed : I was looking , and behold , there was a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was great .
27:4:011:0	The tree grew large and became strongAnd its height reached to the sky , And it was visible to the end of the whole earth .
27:4:012:0	Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant , And in it was food for all . The beasts of the field found shade under it , And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches , And all living creatures fed themselves from it .
27:4:013:0	‘I was looking in the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed , and behold , an angelic watcher , a holy one , descended from heaven .
27:4:014:0	He shouted out and spoke as follows : “ Chop down the tree and cut off its branches , Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit ; Let the beasts flee from under itAnd the birds from its branches .
27:4:015:0	Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground , But with a band of iron and bronze around itIn the new grass of the field ; And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven , And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth .
27:4:016:0	Let his mind be changed from that of a manAnd let a beast’s mind be given to him , And let seven periods of time pass over him .
27:4:017:0	This sentence is by the decree of the angelic watchersAnd the decision is a command of the holy ones , In order that the living may knowThat the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind , And bestows it on whom He wishesAnd sets over it the lowliest of men . ”
27:4:003:1	Daniel Interprets the Vision
27:4:018:0	This is the dream which I , King Nebuchadnezzar , have seen . Now you , Belteshazzar , tell me its interpretation , inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able to make known to me the interpretation ; but you are able , for a spirit of the holy gods is in you . ’
27:4:019:0	“ Then Daniel , whose name is Belteshazzar , was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him . The king responded and said , ‘Belteshazzar , do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you . ’ Belteshazzar replied , ‘My lord , if only the dream applied to those who hate you and its interpretation to your adversaries !
27:4:020:0	The tree that you saw , which became large and grew strong , whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth
27:4:021:0	and whose foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant , and in which was food for all , under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged—
27:4:022:0	it is you , O king ; for you have become great and grown strong , and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth .
27:4:023:0	In that the king saw an angelic watcher , a holy one , descending from heaven and saying , “ Chop down the tree and destroy it ; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground , but with a band of iron and bronze around it in the new grass of the field , and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven , and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him , ”
27:4:024:0	this is the interpretation , O king , and this is the decree of the Most High , which has come upon my lord the king :
27:4:025:0	that you be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field , and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven ; and seven periods of time will pass over you , until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes .
27:4:026:0	And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree , your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that it is Heaven that rules .
27:4:004:1	The Vision Fulfilled
27:4:027:0	Therefore , O king , may my advice be pleasing to you : break away now from your sins by doing righteousness and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor , in case there may be a prolonging of your prosperity . ’
27:4:028:0	“ All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king .
27:4:029:0	Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon .
27:4:030:0	The king reflected and said , ‘Is this not Babylon the great , which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ? ’
27:4:031:0	While the word was in the king’s mouth , a voice came from heaven , saying , ‘King Nebuchadnezzar , to you it is declared : sovereignty has been removed from you ,
27:4:032:0	and you will be driven away from mankind , and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field . You will be given grass to eat like cattle , and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes . ’
27:4:033:0	Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled ; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle , and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws .
27:4:034:0	“ But at the end of that period , I , Nebuchadnezzar , raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me , and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever ; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion , And His kingdom endures from generation to generation .
27:4:035:0	All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing , But He does according to His will in the host of heavenAnd among the inhabitants of earth ; And no one can ward off His handOr say to Him , ‘What have You done ? ’
27:4:036:0	At that time my reason returned to me . And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom , and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out ; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty , and surpassing greatness was added to me .
27:4:037:0	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise , exalt and honor the King of heaven , for all His works are true and His ways just , and He is able to humble those who walk in pride . ”
