27:1:001:1	The Choice Young Men
27:1:001:0	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it .
27:1:002:0	The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , along with some of the vessels of the house of God ; and he brought them to the land of Shinar , to the house of his god , and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god .
27:1:003:0	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz , the chief of his officials , to bring in some of the sons of Israel , including some of the royal family and of the nobles ,
27:1:004:0	youths in whom was no defect , who were good-looking , showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom , endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge , and who had ability for serving in the king’s court ; and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans .
27:1:005:0	The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king’s choice food and from the wine which he drank , and appointed that they should be educated three years , at the end of which they were to enter the king’s personal service .
27:1:006:0	Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah .
27:1:002:1	Daniel’s Resolve
27:1:007:0	Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them ; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar , to Hananiah Shadrach , to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego .
27:1:008:0	But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s choice food or with the wine which he drank ; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself .
27:1:009:0	Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials ,
27:1:010:0	and the commander of the officials said to Daniel , “ I am afraid of my lord the king , who has appointed your food and your drink ; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age ? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king . ”
27:1:011:0	But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah ,
27:1:012:0	“ Please test your servants for ten days , and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink .
27:1:013:0	Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king’s choice food ; and deal with your servants according to what you see . ”
27:1:014:0	So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days .
27:1:015:0	At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king’s choice food .
27:1:016:0	So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink , and kept giving them vegetables .
27:1:017:0	As for these four youths , God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom ; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams .
27:1:018:0	Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them , the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar .
27:1:019:0	The king talked with them , and out of them all not one was found like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah ; so they entered the king’s personal service .
27:1:020:0	As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm .
27:1:021:0	And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king .
