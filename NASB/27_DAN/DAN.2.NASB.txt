27:2:001:1	The King’s Forgotten Dream
27:2:001:0	Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar had dreams ; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him .
27:2:002:0	Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians , the conjurers , the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams . So they came in and stood before the king .
27:2:003:0	The king said to them , “ I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream . ”
27:2:004:0	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic : “ O king , live forever ! Tell the dream to your servants , and we will declare the interpretation . ”
27:2:005:0	The king replied to the Chaldeans , “ The command from me is firm : if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap .
27:2:006:0	But if you declare the dream and its interpretation , you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor ; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation . ”
27:2:007:0	They answered a second time and said , “ Let the king tell the dream to his servants , and we will declare the interpretation . ”
27:2:008:0	The king replied , “ I know for certain that you are bargaining for time , inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm ,
27:2:009:0	that if you do not make the dream known to me , there is only one decree for you . For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed ; therefore tell me the dream , that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation . ”
27:2:010:0	The Chaldeans answered the king and said , “ There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king , inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician , conjurer or Chaldean .
27:2:011:0	Moreover , the thing which the king demands is difficult , and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods , whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh . ”
27:2:012:0	Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
27:2:013:0	So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain ; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them .
27:2:014:0	Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch , the captain of the king’s bodyguard , who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon ;
27:2:015:0	he said to Arioch , the king’s commander , “ For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent ? ” Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter .
27:2:016:0	So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time , in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king .
27:2:017:0	Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah , about the matter ,
27:2:002:1	The Secret Is Revealed to Daniel
27:2:018:0	so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery , so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
27:2:019:0	Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision . Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven ;
27:2:020:0	Daniel said , “ Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever , For wisdom and power belong to Him .
27:2:021:0	It is He who changes the times and the epochs ; He removes kings and establishes kings ; He gives wisdom to wise menAnd knowledge to men of understanding .
27:2:022:0	It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things ; He knows what is in the darkness , And the light dwells with Him .
27:2:023:0	To You , O God of my fathers , I give thanks and praise , For You have given me wisdom and power ; Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You , For You have made known to us the king’s matter . ”
27:2:024:0	Therefore , Daniel went in to Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon ; he went and spoke to him as follows : “ Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon ! Take me into the king’s presence , and I will declare the interpretation to the king . ”
27:2:025:0	Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king’s presence and spoke to him as follows : “ I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king ! ”
27:2:026:0	The king said to Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , “ Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation ? ”
27:2:027:0	Daniel answered before the king and said , “ As for the mystery about which the king has inquired , neither wise men , conjurers , magicians nor diviners are able to declare it to the king .
27:2:028:0	However , there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries , and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days . This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed .
27:2:029:0	As for you , O king , while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future ; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place .
27:2:003:1	The King’s Dream
27:2:030:0	But as for me , this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man , but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king , and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind .
27:2:031:0	“ You , O king , were looking and behold , there was a single great statue ; that statue , which was large and of extraordinary splendor , was standing in front of you , and its appearance was awesome .
27:2:032:0	The head of that statue was made of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of bronze ,
27:2:033:0	its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of clay .
27:2:034:0	You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands , and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them .
27:2:004:1	The Interpretation—Babylon the First Kingdom
27:2:035:0	Then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors ; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found . But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth .
27:2:036:0	“ This was the dream ; now we will tell its interpretation before the king .
27:2:037:0	You , O king , are the king of kings , to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom , the power , the strength and the glory ;
27:2:005:1	Medo-Persia and Greece
27:2:038:0	and wherever the sons of men dwell , or the beasts of the field , or the birds of the sky , He has given them into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all . You are the head of gold .
27:2:006:1	Rome
27:2:039:0	After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you , then another third kingdom of bronze , which will rule over all the earth .
27:2:040:0	Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron ; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things , so , like iron that breaks in pieces , it will crush and break all these in pieces .
27:2:041:0	In that you saw the feet and toes , partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron , it will be a divided kingdom ; but it will have in it the toughness of iron , inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay .
27:2:042:0	As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery , so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle .
27:2:007:1	The Divine Kingdom
27:2:043:0	And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay , they will combine with one another in the seed of men ; but they will not adhere to one another , even as iron does not combine with pottery .
27:2:044:0	In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed , and that kingdom will not be left for another people ; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms , but it will itself endure forever .
27:2:008:1	Daniel Promoted
27:2:045:0	Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron , the bronze , the clay , the silver and the gold , the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future ; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy . ”
27:2:046:0	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel , and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense .
27:2:047:0	The king answered Daniel and said , “ Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries , since you have been able to reveal this mystery . ”
27:2:048:0	Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts , and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon .
27:2:049:0	And Daniel made request of the king , and he appointed Shadrach , Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon , while Daniel was at the king’s court .
