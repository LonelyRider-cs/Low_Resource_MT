5:22:001:1	Sundry Laws
5:22:001:0	“ You shall not see your countryman’s ox or his sheep straying away , and pay no attention to them ; you shall certainly bring them back to your countryman .
5:22:002:0	If your countryman is not near you , or if you do not know him , then you shall bring it home to your house , and it shall remain with you until your countryman looks for it ; then you shall restore it to him .
5:22:003:0	Thus you shall do with his donkey , and you shall do the same with his garment , and you shall do likewise with anything lost by your countryman , which he has lost and you have found . You are not allowed to neglect them .
5:22:004:0	You shall not see your countryman’s donkey or his ox fallen down on the way , and pay no attention to them ; you shall certainly help him to raise them up .
5:22:005:0	“ A woman shall not wear man’s clothing , nor shall a man put on a woman’s clothing ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God .
5:22:006:0	“ If you happen to come upon a bird’s nest along the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs , you shall not take the mother with the young ;
5:22:007:0	you shall certainly let the mother go , but the young you may take for yourself , in order that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days .
5:22:008:0	“ When you build a new house , you shall make a parapet for your roof , so that you will not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone falls from it .
5:22:009:0	“ You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , or all the produce of the seed which you have sown and the increase of the vineyard will become defiled .
5:22:010:0	“ You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together .
5:22:011:0	“ You shall not wear a material mixed of wool and linen together .
5:22:002:1	Laws on Morality
5:22:012:0	“ You shall make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garment with which you cover yourself .
5:22:013:0	“ If any man takes a wife and goes in to her and then turns against her ,
5:22:014:0	and charges her with shameful deeds and publicly defames her , and says , ‘I took this woman , but when I came near her , I did not find her a virgin , ’
5:22:015:0	then the girl’s father and her mother shall take and bring out the evidence of the girl’s virginity to the elders of the city at the gate .
5:22:016:0	The girl’s father shall say to the elders , ‘I gave my daughter to this man for a wife , but he turned against her ;
5:22:017:0	and behold , he has charged her with shameful deeds , saying , “ I did not find your daughter a virgin . ” But this is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity . ’ And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city .
5:22:018:0	So the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ,
5:22:019:0	and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give it to the girl’s father , because he publicly defamed a virgin of Israel . And she shall remain his wife ; he cannot divorce her all his days .
5:22:020:0	“ But if this charge is true , that the girl was not found a virgin ,
5:22:021:0	then they shall bring out the girl to the doorway of her father’s house , and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed an act of folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father’s house ; thus you shall purge the evil from among you .
5:22:022:0	“ If a man is found lying with a married woman , then both of them shall die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman ; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel .
5:22:023:0	“ If there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man , and another man finds her in the city and lies with her ,
5:22:024:0	then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and you shall stone them to death ; the girl , because she did not cry out in the city , and the man , because he has violated his neighbor’s wife . Thus you shall purge the evil from among you .
5:22:025:0	“ But if in the field the man finds the girl who is engaged , and the man forces her and lies with her , then only the man who lies with her shall die .
5:22:026:0	But you shall do nothing to the girl ; there is no sin in the girl worthy of death , for just as a man rises against his neighbor and murders him , so is this case .
5:22:027:0	When he found her in the field , the engaged girl cried out , but there was no one to save her .
5:22:028:0	“ If a man finds a girl who is a virgin , who is not engaged , and seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered ,
5:22:029:0	then the man who lay with her shall give to the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall become his wife because he has violated her ; he cannot divorce her all his days .
5:22:030:0	“ A man shall not take his father’s wife so that he will not uncover his father’s skirt .
