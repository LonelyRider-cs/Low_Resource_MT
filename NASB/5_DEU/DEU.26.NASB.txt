5:26:001:1	Offering First Fruits
5:26:001:0	“ Then it shall be , when you enter the land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance , and you possess it and live in it ,
5:26:002:0	that you shall take some of the first of all the produce of the ground which you bring in from your land that the Lord your God gives you , and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish His name .
5:26:003:0	You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him , ‘I declare this day to the Lord my God that I have entered the land which the Lord swore to our fathers to give us . ’
5:26:004:0	Then the priest shall take the basket from your hand and set it down before the altar of the Lord your God .
5:26:005:0	You shall answer and say before the Lord your God , ‘My father was a wandering Aramean , and he went down to Egypt and sojourned there , few in number ; but there he became a great , mighty and populous nation .
5:26:006:0	And the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us , and imposed hard labor on us .
5:26:007:0	Then we cried to the Lord , the God of our fathers , and the Lord heard our voice and saw our affliction and our toil and our oppression ;
5:26:008:0	and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror and with signs and wonders ;
5:26:009:0	and He has brought us to this place and has given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
5:26:010:0	Now behold , I have brought the first of the produce of the ground which You , O Lord have given me . ’ And you shall set it down before the Lord your God , and worship before the Lord your God ;
5:26:011:0	and you and the Levite and the alien who is among you shall rejoice in all the good which the Lord your God has given you and your household .
5:26:012:0	“ When you have finished paying all the tithe of your increase in the third year , the year of tithing , then you shall give it to the Levite , to the stranger , to the orphan and to the widow , that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied .
5:26:013:0	You shall say before the Lord your God , ‘I have removed the sacred portion from my house , and also have given it to the Levite and the alien , the orphan and the widow , according to all Your commandments which You have commanded me ; I have not transgressed or forgotten any of Your commandments .
5:26:014:0	I have not eaten of it while mourning , nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean , nor offered any of it to the dead . I have listened to the voice of the Lord my God ; I have done according to all that You have commanded me .
5:26:015:0	Look down from Your holy habitation , from heaven , and bless Your people Israel , and the ground which You have given us , a land flowing with milk and honey , as You swore to our fathers . ’
5:26:016:0	“ This day the Lord your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances . You shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your soul .
5:26:017:0	You have today declared the Lord to be your God , and that you would walk in His ways and keep His statutes , His commandments and His ordinances , and listen to His voice .
5:26:018:0	The Lord has today declared you to be His people , a treasured possession , as He promised you , and that you should keep all His commandments ;
5:26:019:0	and that He will set you high above all nations which He has made , for praise , fame , and honor ; and that you shall be a consecrated people to the Lord your God , as He has spoken . ”
