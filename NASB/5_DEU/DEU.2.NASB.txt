5:2:001:1	Wanderings in the Wilderness
5:2:001:0	“ Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as the Lord spoke to me , and circled Mount Seir for many days .
5:2:002:0	And the Lord spoke to me , saying ,
5:2:003:0	‘You have circled this mountain long enough . Now turn north ,
5:2:004:0	and command the people , saying , “ You will pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau who live in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you . So be very careful ;
5:2:005:0	do not provoke them , for I will not give you any of their land , even as little as a footstep because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession .
5:2:006:0	You shall buy food from them with money so that you may eat , and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink .
5:2:007:0	For the Lord your God has blessed you in all that you have done ; He has known your wanderings through this great wilderness . These forty years the Lord your God has been with you ; you have not lacked a thing . ” ’
5:2:008:0	“ So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau , who live in Seir , away from the Arabah road , away from Elath and from Ezion-geber . And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
5:2:009:0	Then the Lord said to me , ‘Do not harass Moab , nor provoke them to war , for I will not give you any of their land as a possession , because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession . ’
5:2:010:0	( The Emim lived there formerly , a people as great , numerous , and tall as the Anakim .
5:2:011:0	Like the Anakim , they are also regarded as Rephaim , but the Moabites call them Emim .
5:2:012:0	The Horites formerly lived in Seir , but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place , just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave to them . )
5:2:013:0	‘Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves . ’ So we crossed over the brook Zered .
5:2:014:0	Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years , until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp , as the Lord had sworn to them .
5:2:015:0	Moreover the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished .
5:2:016:0	“ So it came about when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people ,
5:2:017:0	that the Lord spoke to me , saying ,
5:2:018:0	‘Today you shall cross over Ar , the border of Moab .
5:2:019:0	When you come opposite the sons of Ammon , do not harass them nor provoke them , for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession , because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession . ’
5:2:020:0	( It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim , for Rephaim formerly lived in it , but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin ,
5:2:021:0	a people as great , numerous , and tall as the Anakim , but the Lord destroyed them before them . And they dispossessed them and settled in their place ,
5:2:022:0	just as He did for the sons of Esau , who live in Seir , when He destroyed the Horites from before them ; they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day .
5:2:023:0	And the Avvim , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor , destroyed them and lived in their place . )
5:2:024:0	‘Arise , set out , and pass through the valley of Arnon . Look ! I have given Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land into your hand ; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle .
5:2:025:0	This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens , who , when they hear the report of you , will tremble and be in anguish because of you . ’
5:2:026:0	“ So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
5:2:027:0	‘Let me pass through your land , I will travel only on the highway ; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left .
5:2:028:0	You will sell me food for money so that I may eat , and give me water for money so that I may drink , only let me pass through on foot ,
5:2:029:0	just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me , until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving to us . ’
5:2:030:0	But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land ; for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate , in order to deliver him into your hand , as he is today .
5:2:031:0	The Lord said to me , ‘See , I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you . Begin to occupy , that you may possess his land . ’
5:2:032:0	“ Then Sihon with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz .
5:2:033:0	The Lord our God delivered him over to us , and we defeated him with his sons and all his people .
5:2:034:0	So we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men , women and children of every city . We left no survivor .
5:2:035:0	We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured .
5:2:036:0	From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and from the city which is in the valley , even to Gilead , there was no city that was too high for us ; the Lord our God delivered all over to us .
5:2:037:0	Only you did not go near to the land of the sons of Ammon , all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country , and wherever the Lord our God had commanded us .
