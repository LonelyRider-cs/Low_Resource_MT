5:23:001:1	Persons Excluded from the Assembly
5:23:001:0	“ No one who is emasculated or has his male organ cut off shall enter the assembly of the Lord .
5:23:002:0	No one of illegitimate birth shall enter the assembly of the Lord ; none of his descendants , even to the tenth generation , shall enter the assembly of the Lord .
5:23:003:0	No Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly of the Lord ; none of their descendants , even to the tenth generation , shall ever enter the assembly of the Lord ,
5:23:004:0	because they did not meet you with food and water on the way when you came out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse you .
5:23:005:0	Nevertheless , the Lord your God was not willing to listen to Balaam , but the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because the Lord your God loves you .
5:23:006:0	You shall never seek their peace or their prosperity all your days .
5:23:007:0	“ You shall not detest an Edomite , for he is your brother ; you shall not detest an Egyptian , because you were an alien in his land .
5:23:008:0	The sons of the third generation who are born to them may enter the assembly of the Lord .
5:23:009:0	“ When you go out as an army against your enemies , you shall keep yourself from every evil thing .
5:23:010:0	“ If there is among you any man who is unclean because of a nocturnal emission , then he must go outside the camp ; he may not reenter the camp .
5:23:011:0	But it shall be when evening approaches , he shall bathe himself with water , and at sundown he may reenter the camp .
5:23:012:0	“ You shall also have a place outside the camp and go out there ,
5:23:013:0	and you shall have a spade among your tools , and it shall be when you sit down outside , you shall dig with it and shall turn to cover up your excrement .
5:23:014:0	Since the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to defeat your enemies before you , therefore your camp must be holy ; and He must not see anything indecent among you or He will turn away from you .
5:23:015:0	“ You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you .
5:23:016:0	He shall live with you in your midst , in the place which he shall choose in one of your towns where it pleases him ; you shall not mistreat him .
5:23:017:0	“ None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute , nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a cult prostitute .
5:23:018:0	You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the wages of a dog into the house of the Lord your God for any votive offering , for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God .
5:23:019:0	“ You shall not charge interest to your countrymen : interest on money , food , or anything that may be loaned at interest .
5:23:020:0	You may charge interest to a foreigner , but to your countrymen you shall not charge interest , so that the Lord your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land which you are about to enter to possess .
5:23:021:0	“ When you make a vow to the Lord your God , you shall not delay to pay it , for it would be sin in you , and the Lord your God will surely require it of you .
5:23:022:0	However , if you refrain from vowing , it would not be sin in you .
5:23:023:0	You shall be careful to perform what goes out from your lips , just as you have voluntarily vowed to the Lord your God , what you have promised .
5:23:024:0	“ When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard , then you may eat grapes until you are fully satisfied , but you shall not put any in your basket .
5:23:025:0	“ When you enter your neighbor’s standing grain , then you may pluck the heads with your hand , but you shall not wield a sickle in your neighbor’s standing grain .
