5:24:001:1	Law of Divorce
5:24:001:0	“ When a man takes a wife and marries her , and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her , and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out from his house ,
5:24:002:0	and she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man’s wife ,
5:24:003:0	and if the latter husband turns against her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house , or if the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife ,
5:24:004:0	then her former husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife , since she has been defiled ; for that is an abomination before the Lord , and you shall not bring sin on the land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance .
5:24:002:1	Sundry Laws
