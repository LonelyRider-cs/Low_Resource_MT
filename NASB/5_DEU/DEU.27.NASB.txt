5:27:001:1	The Curses of Mount Ebal
5:27:001:0	Then Moses and the elders of Israel charged the people , saying , “ Keep all the commandments which I command you today .
5:27:002:0	So it shall be on the day when you cross the Jordan to the land which the Lord your God gives you , that you shall set up for yourself large stones and coat them with lime
5:27:003:0	and write on them all the words of this law , when you cross over , so that you may enter the land which the Lord your God gives you , a land flowing with milk and honey , as the Lord , the God of your fathers , promised you .
5:27:004:0	So it shall be when you cross the Jordan , you shall set up on Mount Ebal , these stones , as I am commanding you today , and you shall coat them with lime .
5:27:005:0	Moreover , you shall build there an altar to the Lord your God , an altar of stones ; you shall not wield an iron tool on them .
5:27:006:0	You shall build the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones , and you shall offer on it burnt offerings to the Lord your God ;
5:27:007:0	and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and eat there , and rejoice before the Lord your God .
5:27:008:0	You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very distinctly . ”
5:27:009:0	Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel , saying , “ Be silent and listen , O Israel ! This day you have become a people for the Lord your God .
5:27:010:0	You shall therefore obey the Lord your God , and do His commandments and His statutes which I command you today . ”
5:27:011:0	Moses also charged the people on that day , saying ,
5:27:012:0	“ When you cross the Jordan , these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people : Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , Joseph , and Benjamin .
5:27:013:0	For the curse , these shall stand on Mount Ebal : Reuben , Gad , Asher , Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
5:27:014:0	The Levites shall then answer and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice ,
5:27:015:0	‘Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image , an abomination to the Lord , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and sets it up in secret . ’ And all the people shall answer and say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:016:0	‘Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:017:0	‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary mark . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:018:0	‘Cursed is he who misleads a blind person on the road . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:019:0	‘Cursed is he who distorts the justice due an alien , orphan , and widow . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:020:0	‘Cursed is he who lies with his father’s wife , because he has uncovered his father’s skirt . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:021:0	‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:022:0	‘Cursed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father or of his mother . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:023:0	‘Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:024:0	‘Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:025:0	‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to strike down an innocent person . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
5:27:026:0	‘Cursed is he who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them . ’ And all the people shall say , ‘Amen . ’
