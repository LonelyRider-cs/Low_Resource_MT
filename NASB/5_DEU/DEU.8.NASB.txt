5:8:001:1	God’s Gracious Dealings
5:8:001:0	“ All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do , that you may live and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your forefathers .
5:8:002:0	You shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years , that He might humble you , testing you , to know what was in your heart , whether you would keep His commandments or not .
5:8:003:0	He humbled you and let you be hungry , and fed you with manna which you did not know , nor did your fathers know , that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone , but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord .
5:8:004:0	Your clothing did not wear out on you , nor did your foot swell these forty years .
5:8:005:0	Thus you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son .
5:8:006:0	Therefore , you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God , to walk in His ways and to fear Him .
5:8:007:0	For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and springs , flowing forth in valleys and hills ;
5:8:008:0	a land of wheat and barley , of vines and fig trees and pomegranates , a land of olive oil and honey ;
5:8:009:0	a land where you will eat food without scarcity , in which you will not lack anything ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills you can dig copper .
5:8:010:0	When you have eaten and are satisfied , you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which He has given you .
5:8:011:0	“ Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today ;
5:8:012:0	otherwise , when you have eaten and are satisfied , and have built good houses and lived in them ,
5:8:013:0	and when your herds and your flocks multiply , and your silver and gold multiply , and all that you have multiplies ,
5:8:014:0	then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
5:8:015:0	He led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water ; He brought water for you out of the rock of flint .
5:8:016:0	In the wilderness He fed you manna which your fathers did not know , that He might humble you and that He might test you , to do good for you in the end .
5:8:017:0	Otherwise , you may say in your heart , ‘My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth . ’
5:8:018:0	But you shall remember the Lord your God , for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth , that He may confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers , as it is this day .
5:8:019:0	It shall come about if you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them , I testify against you today that you will surely perish .
5:8:020:0	Like the nations that the Lord makes to perish before you , so you shall perish ; because you would not listen to the voice of the Lord your God .
