5:29:001:1	The Covenant in Moab
5:29:001:0	These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab , besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb .
5:29:002:0	And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them , “ You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land ;
5:29:003:0	the great trials which your eyes have seen , those great signs and wonders .
5:29:004:0	Yet to this day the Lord has not given you a heart to know , nor eyes to see , nor ears to hear .
5:29:005:0	I have led you forty years in the wilderness ; your clothes have not worn out on you , and your sandal has not worn out on your foot .
5:29:006:0	You have not eaten bread , nor have you drunk wine or strong drink , in order that you might know that I am the Lord your God .
5:29:007:0	When you reached this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle , but we defeated them ;
5:29:008:0	and we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half-tribe of the Manassites .
5:29:009:0	So keep the words of this covenant to do them , that you may prosper in all that you do .
5:29:010:0	“ You stand today , all of you , before the Lord your God : your chiefs , your tribes , your elders and your officers , even all the men of Israel ,
5:29:011:0	your little ones , your wives , and the alien who is within your camps , from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water ,
5:29:012:0	that you may enter into the covenant with the Lord your God , and into His oath which the Lord your God is making with you today ,
5:29:013:0	in order that He may establish you today as His people and that He may be your God , just as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
5:29:014:0	“ Now not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath ,
5:29:015:0	but both with those who stand here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God and with those who are not with us here today
5:29:016:0	( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
5:29:017:0	moreover , you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood , stone , silver , and gold , which they had with them ) ;
5:29:018:0	so that there will not be among you a man or woman , or family or tribe , whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God , to go and serve the gods of those nations ; that there will not be among you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood .
5:29:019:0	It shall be when he hears the words of this curse , that he will boast , saying , ‘I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart in order to destroy the watered land with the dry . ’
5:29:020:0	The Lord shall never be willing to forgive him , but rather the anger of the Lord and His jealousy will burn against that man , and every curse which is written in this book will rest on him , and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven .
5:29:021:0	Then the Lord will single him out for adversity from all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant which are written in this book of the law .
5:29:022:0	“ Now the generation to come , your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land , when they see the plagues of the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it , will say ,
5:29:023:0	‘All its land is brimstone and salt , a burning waste , unsown and unproductive , and no grass grows in it , like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboiim , which the Lord overthrew in His anger and in His wrath . ’
5:29:024:0	All the nations will say , ‘Why has the Lord done thus to this land ? Why this great outburst of anger ? ’
5:29:025:0	Then men will say , ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord , the God of their fathers , which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt .
5:29:026:0	They went and served other gods and worshiped them , gods whom they have not known and whom He had not allotted to them .
5:29:027:0	Therefore , the anger of the Lord burned against that land , to bring upon it every curse which is written in this book ;
5:29:028:0	and the Lord uprooted them from their land in anger and in fury and in great wrath , and cast them into another land , as it is this day . ’
5:29:029:0	“ The secret things belong to the Lord our God , but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever , that we may observe all the words of this law .
