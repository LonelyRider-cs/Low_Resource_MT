5:15:001:1	The Sabbatic Year
5:15:001:0	“ At the end of every seven years you shall grant a remission of debts .
5:15:002:0	This is the manner of remission : every creditor shall release what he has loaned to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother , because the Lord’s remission has been proclaimed .
5:15:003:0	From a foreigner you may exact it , but your hand shall release whatever of yours is with your brother .
5:15:004:0	However , there will be no poor among you , since the Lord will surely bless you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess ,
5:15:005:0	if only you listen obediently to the voice of the Lord your God , to observe carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today .
5:15:006:0	For the Lord your God will bless you as He has promised you , and you will lend to many nations , but you will not borrow ; and you will rule over many nations , but they will not rule over you .
5:15:007:0	“ If there is a poor man with you , one of your brothers , in any of your towns in your land which the Lord your God is giving you , you shall not harden your heart , nor close your hand from your poor brother ;
5:15:008:0	but you shall freely open your hand to him , and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks .
5:15:009:0	Beware that there is no base thought in your heart , saying , ‘The seventh year , the year of remission , is near , ’ and your eye is hostile toward your poor brother , and you give him nothing ; then he may cry to the Lord against you , and it will be a sin in you .
5:15:010:0	You shall generously give to him , and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him , because for this thing the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings .
5:15:011:0	For the poor will never cease to be in the land ; therefore I command you , saying , ‘You shall freely open your hand to your brother , to your needy and poor in your land . ’
5:15:012:0	“ If your kinsman , a Hebrew man or woman , is sold to you , then he shall serve you six years , but in the seventh year you shall set him free .
5:15:013:0	When you set him free , you shall not send him away empty-handed .
5:15:014:0	You shall furnish him liberally from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat ; you shall give to him as the Lord your God has blessed you .
5:15:015:0	You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt , and the Lord your God redeemed you ; therefore I command you this today .
5:15:016:0	It shall come about if he says to you , ‘I will not go out from you , ’ because he loves you and your household , since he fares well with you ;
5:15:017:0	then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door , and he shall be your servant forever . Also you shall do likewise to your maidservant .
5:15:018:0	“ It shall not seem hard to you when you set him free , for he has given you six years with double the service of a hired man ; so the Lord your God will bless you in whatever you do .
5:15:019:0	“ You shall consecrate to the Lord your God all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock ; you shall not work with the firstborn of your herd , nor shear the firstborn of your flock .
5:15:020:0	You and your household shall eat it every year before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord chooses .
5:15:021:0	But if it has any defect , such as lameness or blindness , or any serious defect , you shall not sacrifice it to the Lord your God .
5:15:022:0	You shall eat it within your gates ; the unclean and the clean alike may eat it , as a gazelle or a deer .
5:15:023:0	Only you shall not eat its blood ; you are to pour it out on the ground like water .
