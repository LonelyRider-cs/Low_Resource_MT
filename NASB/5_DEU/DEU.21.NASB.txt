5:21:001:1	Expiation of a Crime
5:21:001:0	“ If a slain person is found lying in the open country in the land which the Lord your God gives you to possess , and it is not known who has struck him ,
5:21:002:0	then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance to the cities which are around the slain one .
5:21:003:0	It shall be that the city which is nearest to the slain man , that is , the elders of that city , shall take a heifer of the herd , which has not been worked and which has not pulled in a yoke ;
5:21:004:0	and the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water , which has not been plowed or sown , and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley .
5:21:005:0	Then the priests , the sons of Levi , shall come near , for the Lord your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of the Lord ; and every dispute and every assault shall be settled by them .
5:21:006:0	All the elders of that city which is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
5:21:007:0	and they shall answer and say , ‘Our hands did not shed this blood , nor did our eyes see it .
5:21:008:0	Forgive Your people Israel whom You have redeemed , O Lord , and do not place the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of Your people Israel . ’ And the bloodguiltiness shall be forgiven them .
5:21:002:1	Domestic Relations
5:21:009:0	So you shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from your midst , when you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord .
5:21:010:0	“ When you go out to battle against your enemies , and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take them away captive ,
5:21:011:0	and see among the captives a beautiful woman , and have a desire for her and would take her as a wife for yourself ,
5:21:012:0	then you shall bring her home to your house , and she shall shave her head and trim her nails .
5:21:013:0	She shall also remove the clothes of her captivity and shall remain in your house , and mourn her father and mother a full month ; and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife .
5:21:014:0	It shall be , if you are not pleased with her , then you shall let her go wherever she wishes ; but you shall certainly not sell her for money , you shall not mistreat her , because you have humbled her .
5:21:015:0	“ If a man has two wives , the one loved and the other unloved , and both the loved and the unloved have borne him sons , if the firstborn son belongs to the unloved ,
5:21:016:0	then it shall be in the day he wills what he has to his sons , he cannot make the son of the loved the firstborn before the son of the unloved , who is the firstborn .
5:21:017:0	But he shall acknowledge the firstborn , the son of the unloved , by giving him a double portion of all that he has , for he is the beginning of his strength ; to him belongs the right of the firstborn .
5:21:018:0	“ If any man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father or his mother , and when they chastise him , he will not even listen to them ,
5:21:019:0	then his father and mother shall seize him , and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gateway of his hometown .
5:21:020:0	They shall say to the elders of his city , ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey us , he is a glutton and a drunkard . ’
5:21:021:0	Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death ; so you shall remove the evil from your midst , and all Israel will hear of it and fear .
5:21:022:0	“ If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and he is put to death , and you hang him on a tree ,
5:21:023:0	his corpse shall not hang all night on the tree , but you shall surely bury him on the same day ( for he who is hanged is accursed of God ) , so that you do not defile your land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance .
