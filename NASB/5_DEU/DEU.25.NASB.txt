5:25:001:1	Sundry Laws
5:25:001:0	“ If there is a dispute between men and they go to court , and the judges decide their case , and they justify the righteous and condemn the wicked ,
5:25:002:0	then it shall be if the wicked man deserves to be beaten , the judge shall then make him lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of stripes according to his guilt .
5:25:003:0	He may beat him forty times but no more , so that he does not beat him with many more stripes than these and your brother is not degraded in your eyes .
5:25:004:0	“ You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing .
5:25:005:0	“ When brothers live together and one of them dies and has no son , the wife of the deceased shall not be married outside the family to a strange man . Her husband’s brother shall go in to her and take her to himself as wife and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her .
5:25:006:0	It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall assume the name of his dead brother , so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel .
5:25:007:0	But if the man does not desire to take his brother’s wife , then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say , ‘My husband’s brother refuses to establish a name for his brother in Israel ; he is not willing to perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me . ’
5:25:008:0	Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak to him . And if he persists and says , ‘I do not desire to take her , ’
5:25:009:0	then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the sight of the elders , and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face ; and she shall declare , ‘Thus it is done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house . ’
5:25:010:0	In Israel his name shall be called , ‘The house of him whose sandal is removed . ’
5:25:011:0	“ If two men , a man and his countryman , are struggling together , and the wife of one comes near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who is striking him , and puts out her hand and seizes his genitals ,
5:25:012:0	then you shall cut off her hand ; you shall not show pity .
5:25:013:0	“ You shall not have in your bag differing weights , a large and a small .
5:25:014:0	You shall not have in your house differing measures , a large and a small .
5:25:015:0	You shall have a full and just weight ; you shall have a full and just measure , that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you .
5:25:016:0	For everyone who does these things , everyone who acts unjustly is an abomination to the Lord your God .
5:25:017:0	“ Remember what Amalek did to you along the way when you came out from Egypt ,
5:25:018:0	how he met you along the way and attacked among you all the stragglers at your rear when you were faint and weary ; and he did not fear God .
5:25:019:0	Therefore it shall come about when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies , in the land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance to possess , you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven ; you must not forget .
