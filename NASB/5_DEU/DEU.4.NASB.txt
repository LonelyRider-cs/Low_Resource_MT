5:4:001:1	Israel Urged to Obey God’s Law
5:4:001:0	“ Now , O Israel , listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform , so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord , the God of your fathers , is giving you .
5:4:002:0	You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you , nor take away from it , that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
5:4:003:0	Your eyes have seen what the Lord has done in the case of Baal-peor , for all the men who followed Baal-peor , the Lord your God has destroyed them from among you .
5:4:004:0	But you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive today , every one of you .
5:4:005:0	“ See , I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the Lord my God commanded me , that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it .
5:4:006:0	So keep and do them , for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say , ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people . ’
5:4:007:0	For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the Lord our God whenever we call on Him ?
5:4:008:0	Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I am setting before you today ?
5:4:009:0	“ Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently , so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life ; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons .
5:4:010:0	Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb , when the Lord said to me , ‘Assemble the people to Me , that I may let them hear My words so they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth , and that they may teach their children . ’
5:4:011:0	You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain , and the mountain burned with fire to the very heart of the heavens : darkness , cloud and thick gloom .
5:4:012:0	Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire ; you heard the sound of words , but you saw no form—only a voice .
5:4:013:0	So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform , that is , the Ten Commandments ; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone .
5:4:014:0	The Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that you might perform them in the land where you are going over to possess it .
5:4:015:0	“ So watch yourselves carefully , since you did not see any form on the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire ,
5:4:016:0	so that you do not act corruptly and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
5:4:017:0	the likeness of any animal that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky ,
5:4:018:0	the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth .
5:4:019:0	And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars , all the host of heaven , and be drawn away and worship them and serve them , those which the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven .
5:4:020:0	But the Lord has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace , from Egypt , to be a people for His own possession , as today .
5:4:021:0	“ Now the Lord was angry with me on your account , and swore that I would not cross the Jordan , and that I would not enter the good land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance .
5:4:022:0	For I will die in this land , I shall not cross the Jordan , but you shall cross and take possession of this good land .
5:4:023:0	So watch yourselves , that you do not forget the covenant of the Lord your God which He made with you , and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything against which the Lord your God has commanded you .
5:4:024:0	For the Lord your God is a consuming fire , a jealous God .
5:4:025:0	“ When you become the father of children and children’s children and have remained long in the land , and act corruptly , and make an idol in the form of anything , and do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord your God so as to provoke Him to anger ,
5:4:026:0	I call heaven and earth to witness against you today , that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it . You shall not live long on it , but will be utterly destroyed .
5:4:027:0	The Lord will scatter you among the peoples , and you will be left few in number among the nations where the Lord drives you .
5:4:028:0	There you will serve gods , the work of man’s hands , wood and stone , which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell .
5:4:029:0	But from there you will seek the Lord your God , and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul .
5:4:030:0	When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you , in the latter days you will return to the Lord your God and listen to His voice .
5:4:031:0	For the Lord your God is a compassionate God ; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them .
5:4:032:0	“ Indeed , ask now concerning the former days which were before you , since the day that God created man on the earth , and inquire from one end of the heavens to the other . Has anything been done like this great thing , or has anything been heard like it ?
5:4:033:0	Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire , as you have heard it , and survived ?
5:4:034:0	Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials , by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors , as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes ?
5:4:035:0	To you it was shown that you might know that the Lord , He is God ; there is no other besides Him .
5:4:036:0	Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you ; and on earth He let you see His great fire , and you heard His words from the midst of the fire .
5:4:037:0	Because He loved your fathers , therefore He chose their descendants after them . And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power ,
5:4:038:0	driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you , to bring you in and to give you their land for an inheritance , as it is today .
5:4:039:0	Know therefore today , and take it to your heart , that the Lord , He is God in heaven above and on the earth below ; there is no other .
5:4:040:0	So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today , that it may go well with you and with your children after you , and that you may live long on the land which the Lord your God is giving you for all time . ”
5:4:041:0	Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east ,
5:4:042:0	that a manslayer might flee there , who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past ; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
5:4:043:0	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites , and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites , and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites .
5:4:044:0	Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel ;
5:4:045:0	these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel , when they came out from Egypt ,
5:4:046:0	across the Jordan , in the valley opposite Beth-peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon , whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt .
5:4:047:0	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two kings of the Amorites , who were across the Jordan to the east ,
5:4:048:0	from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon , even as far as Mount Sion ( that is , Hermon ) ,
5:4:049:0	with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east , even as far as the sea of the Arabah , at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah .
