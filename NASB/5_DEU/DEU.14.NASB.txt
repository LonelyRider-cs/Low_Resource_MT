5:14:001:1	Clean and Unclean Animals
5:14:001:0	“ You are the sons of the Lord your God ; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead .
5:14:002:0	For you are a holy people to the Lord your God , and the Lord has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth .
5:14:003:0	“ You shall not eat any detestable thing .
5:14:004:0	These are the animals which you may eat : the ox , the sheep , the goat ,
5:14:005:0	the deer , the gazelle , the roebuck , the wild goat , the ibex , the antelope and the mountain sheep .
5:14:006:0	Any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud , among the animals , that you may eat .
5:14:007:0	Nevertheless , you are not to eat of these among those which chew the cud , or among those that divide the hoof in two : the camel and the rabbit and the shaphan , for though they chew the cud , they do not divide the hoof ; they are unclean for you .
5:14:008:0	The pig , because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud , it is unclean for you . You shall not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses .
5:14:009:0	“ These you may eat of all that are in water : anything that has fins and scales you may eat ,
5:14:010:0	but anything that does not have fins and scales you shall not eat ; it is unclean for you .
5:14:011:0	“ You may eat any clean bird .
5:14:012:0	But these are the ones which you shall not eat : the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard ,
5:14:013:0	and the red kite , the falcon , and the kite in their kinds ,
5:14:014:0	and every raven in its kind ,
5:14:015:0	and the ostrich , the owl , the sea gull , and the hawk in their kinds ,
5:14:016:0	the little owl , the great owl , the white owl ,
5:14:017:0	the pelican , the carrion vulture , the cormorant ,
5:14:018:0	the stork , and the heron in their kinds , and the hoopoe and the bat .
5:14:019:0	And all the teeming life with wings are unclean to you ; they shall not be eaten .
5:14:020:0	You may eat any clean bird .
5:14:021:0	“ You shall not eat anything which dies of itself . You may give it to the alien who is in your town , so that he may eat it , or you may sell it to a foreigner , for you are a holy people to the Lord your God . You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk .
5:14:022:0	“ You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow , which comes out of the field every year .
5:14:023:0	You shall eat in the presence of the Lord your God , at the place where He chooses to establish His name , the tithe of your grain , your new wine , your oil , and the firstborn of your herd and your flock , so that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always .
5:14:024:0	If the distance is so great for you that you are not able to bring the tithe , since the place where the Lord your God chooses to set His name is too far away from you when the Lord your God blesses you ,
5:14:025:0	then you shall exchange it for money , and bind the money in your hand and go to the place which the Lord your God chooses .
5:14:026:0	You may spend the money for whatever your heart desires : for oxen , or sheep , or wine , or strong drink , or whatever your heart desires ; and there you shall eat in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice , you and your household .
5:14:027:0	Also you shall not neglect the Levite who is in your town , for he has no portion or inheritance among you .
5:14:028:0	“ At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year , and shall deposit it in your town .
5:14:029:0	The Levite , because he has no portion or inheritance among you , and the alien , the orphan and the widow who are in your town , shall come and eat and be satisfied , in order that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do .
