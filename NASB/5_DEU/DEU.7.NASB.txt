5:7:001:1	Warnings
5:7:001:0	“ When the Lord your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it , and clears away many nations before you , the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites , seven nations greater and stronger than you ,
5:7:002:0	and when the Lord your God delivers them before you and you defeat them , then you shall utterly destroy them . You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them .
5:7:003:0	Furthermore , you shall not intermarry with them ; you shall not give your daughters to their sons , nor shall you take their daughters for your sons .
5:7:004:0	For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods ; then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and He will quickly destroy you .
5:7:005:0	But thus you shall do to them : you shall tear down their altars , and smash their sacred pillars , and hew down their Asherim , and burn their graven images with fire .
5:7:006:0	For you are a holy people to the Lord your God ; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth .
5:7:007:0	“ The Lord did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples , for you were the fewest of all peoples ,
5:7:008:0	but because the Lord loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers , the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
5:7:009:0	Know therefore that the Lord your God , He is God , the faithful God , who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments ;
5:7:010:0	but repays those who hate Him to their faces , to destroy them ; He will not delay with him who hates Him , He will repay him to his face .
5:7:002:1	Promises of God
5:7:011:0	Therefore , you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today , to do them .
5:7:012:0	“ Then it shall come about , because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them , that the Lord your God will keep with you His covenant and His lovingkindness which He swore to your forefathers .
5:7:013:0	He will love you and bless you and multiply you ; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground , your grain and your new wine and your oil , the increase of your herd and the young of your flock , in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you .
5:7:014:0	You shall be blessed above all peoples ; there will be no male or female barren among you or among your cattle .
5:7:015:0	The Lord will remove from you all sickness ; and He will not put on you any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known , but He will lay them on all who hate you .
5:7:016:0	You shall consume all the peoples whom the Lord your God will deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them , nor shall you serve their gods , for that would be a snare to you .
5:7:017:0	“ If you should say in your heart , ‘These nations are greater than I ; how can I dispossess them ? ’
5:7:018:0	you shall not be afraid of them ; you shall well remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt :
5:7:019:0	the great trials which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out . So shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid .
5:7:020:0	Moreover , the Lord your God will send the hornet against them , until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish .
5:7:021:0	You shall not dread them , for the Lord your God is in your midst , a great and awesome God .
5:7:022:0	The Lord your God will clear away these nations before you little by little ; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly , for the wild beasts would grow too numerous for you .
5:7:023:0	But the Lord your God will deliver them before you , and will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed .
5:7:024:0	He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you will make their name perish from under heaven ; no man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them .
5:7:025:0	The graven images of their gods you are to burn with fire ; you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them , nor take it for yourselves , or you will be snared by it , for it is an abomination to the Lord your God .
5:7:026:0	You shall not bring an abomination into your house , and like it come under the ban ; you shall utterly detest it and you shall utterly abhor it , for it is something banned .
