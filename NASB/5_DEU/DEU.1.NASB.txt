5:1:001:1	Israel’s History after the Exodus
5:1:001:0	These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness , in the Arabah opposite Suph , between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab .
5:1:002:0	It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea .
5:1:003:0	In the fortieth year , on the first day of the eleventh month , Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that the Lord had commanded him to give to them ,
5:1:004:0	after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites , who lived in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei .
5:1:005:0	Across the Jordan in the land of Moab , Moses undertook to expound this law , saying ,
5:1:006:0	“ The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb , saying , ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain .
5:1:007:0	Turn and set your journey , and go to the hill country of the Amorites , and to all their neighbors in the Arabah , in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negev and by the seacoast , the land of the Canaanites , and Lebanon , as far as the great river , the river Euphrates .
5:1:008:0	See , I have placed the land before you ; go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to them and their descendants after them . ’
5:1:009:0	“ I spoke to you at that time , saying , ‘I am not able to bear the burden of you alone .
5:1:010:0	The Lord your God has multiplied you , and behold , you are this day like the stars of heaven in number .
5:1:011:0	May the Lord , the God of your fathers , increase you a thousand-fold more than you are and bless you , just as He has promised you !
5:1:012:0	How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife ?
5:1:013:0	Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes , and I will appoint them as your heads . ’
5:1:014:0	You answered me and said , ‘The thing which you have said to do is good . ’
5:1:015:0	So I took the heads of your tribes , wise and experienced men , and appointed them heads over you , leaders of thousands and of hundreds , of fifties and of tens , and officers for your tribes .
5:1:016:0	“ Then I charged your judges at that time , saying , ‘Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen , and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman , or the alien who is with him .
5:1:017:0	You shall not show partiality in judgment ; you shall hear the small and the great alike . You shall not fear man , for the judgment is God’s . The case that is too hard for you , you shall bring to me , and I will hear it . ’
5:1:018:0	I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do .
5:1:019:0	“ Then we set out from Horeb , and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites , just as the Lord our God had commanded us ; and we came to Kadesh-barnea .
5:1:020:0	I said to you , ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the Lord our God is about to give us .
5:1:021:0	See , the Lord your God has placed the land before you ; go up , take possession , as the Lord , the God of your fathers , has spoken to you . Do not fear or be dismayed . ’
5:1:022:0	“ Then all of you approached me and said , ‘Let us send men before us , that they may search out the land for us , and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up and the cities which we shall enter . ’
5:1:023:0	The thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men , one man for each tribe .
5:1:024:0	They turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the valley of Eshcol and spied it out .
5:1:025:0	Then they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us ; and they brought us back a report and said , ‘It is a good land which the Lord our God is about to give us . ’
5:1:026:0	“ Yet you were not willing to go up , but rebelled against the command of the Lord your God ;
5:1:027:0	and you grumbled in your tents and said , ‘Because the Lord hates us , He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us .
5:1:028:0	Where can we go up ? Our brethren have made our hearts melt , saying , “ The people are bigger and taller than we ; the cities are large and fortified to heaven . And besides , we saw the sons of the Anakim there . ” ’
5:1:029:0	Then I said to you , ‘Do not be shocked , nor fear them .
5:1:030:0	The Lord your God who goes before you will Himself fight on your behalf , just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes ,
5:1:031:0	and in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you , just as a man carries his son , in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place . ’
5:1:032:0	But for all this , you did not trust the Lord your God ,
5:1:033:0	who goes before you on your way , to seek out a place for you to encamp , in fire by night and cloud by day , to show you the way in which you should go .
5:1:034:0	“ Then the Lord heard the sound of your words , and He was angry and took an oath , saying ,
5:1:035:0	‘Not one of these men , this evil generation , shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers ,
5:1:036:0	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has set foot , because he has followed the Lord fully . ’
5:1:037:0	The Lord was angry with me also on your account , saying , ‘Not even you shall enter there .
5:1:038:0	Joshua the son of Nun , who stands before you , he shall enter there ; encourage him , for he will cause Israel to inherit it .
5:1:039:0	Moreover , your little ones who you said would become a prey , and your sons , who this day have no knowledge of good or evil , shall enter there , and I will give it to them and they shall possess it .
5:1:040:0	But as for you , turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea . ’
5:1:041:0	“ Then you said to me , ‘We have sinned against the Lord ; we will indeed go up and fight , just as the Lord our God commanded us . ’ And every man of you girded on his weapons of war , and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country .
5:1:042:0	And the Lord said to me , ‘Say to them , “ Do not go up nor fight , for I am not among you ; otherwise you will be defeated before your enemies . ” ’
5:1:043:0	So I spoke to you , but you would not listen . Instead you rebelled against the command of the Lord , and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country .
5:1:044:0	The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do , and crushed you from Seir to Hormah .
5:1:045:0	Then you returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord did not listen to your voice nor give ear to you .
5:1:046:0	So you remained in Kadesh many days , the days that you spent there .
