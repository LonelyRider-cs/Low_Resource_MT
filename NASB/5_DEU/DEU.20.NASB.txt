5:20:001:1	Laws of Warfare
5:20:001:0	“ When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you , do not be afraid of them ; for the Lord your God , who brought you up from the land of Egypt , is with you .
5:20:002:0	When you are approaching the battle , the priest shall come near and speak to the people .
5:20:003:0	He shall say to them , ‘Hear , O Israel , you are approaching the battle against your enemies today . Do not be fainthearted . Do not be afraid , or panic , or tremble before them ,
5:20:004:0	for the Lord your God is the one who goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you . ’
5:20:005:0	The officers also shall speak to the people , saying , ‘Who is the man that has built a new house and has not dedicated it ? Let him depart and return to his house , otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would dedicate it .
5:20:006:0	Who is the man that has planted a vineyard and has not begun to use its fruit ? Let him depart and return to his house , otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would begin to use its fruit .
5:20:007:0	And who is the man that is engaged to a woman and has not married her ? Let him depart and return to his house , otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would marry her . ’
5:20:008:0	Then the officers shall speak further to the people and say , ‘Who is the man that is afraid and fainthearted ? Let him depart and return to his house , so that he might not make his brothers’ hearts melt like his heart . ’
5:20:009:0	When the officers have finished speaking to the people , they shall appoint commanders of armies at the head of the people .
5:20:010:0	“ When you approach a city to fight against it , you shall offer it terms of peace .
5:20:011:0	If it agrees to make peace with you and opens to you , then all the people who are found in it shall become your forced labor and shall serve you .
5:20:012:0	However , if it does not make peace with you , but makes war against you , then you shall besiege it .
5:20:013:0	When the Lord your God gives it into your hand , you shall strike all the men in it with the edge of the sword .
5:20:014:0	Only the women and the children and the animals and all that is in the city , all its spoil , you shall take as booty for yourself ; and you shall use the spoil of your enemies which the Lord your God has given you .
5:20:015:0	Thus you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you , which are not of the cities of these nations nearby .
5:20:016:0	Only in the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance , you shall not leave alive anything that breathes .
5:20:017:0	But you shall utterly destroy them , the Hittite and the Amorite , the Canaanite and the Perizzite , the Hivite and the Jebusite , as the Lord your God has commanded you ,
5:20:018:0	so that they may not teach you to do according to all their detestable things which they have done for their gods , so that you would sin against the Lord your God .
5:20:019:0	“ When you besiege a city a long time , to make war against it in order to capture it , you shall not destroy its trees by swinging an axe against them ; for you may eat from them , and you shall not cut them down . For is the tree of the field a man , that it should be besieged by you ?
5:20:020:0	Only the trees which you know are not fruit trees you shall destroy and cut down , that you may construct siegeworks against the city that is making war with you until it falls .
