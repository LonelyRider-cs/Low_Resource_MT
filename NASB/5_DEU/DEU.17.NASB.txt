5:17:001:1	Administration of Justice
5:17:001:0	“ You shall not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep which has a blemish or any defect , for that is a detestable thing to the Lord your God .
5:17:002:0	“ If there is found in your midst , in any of your towns , which the Lord your God is giving you , a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God , by transgressing His covenant ,
5:17:003:0	and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them , or the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host , which I have not commanded ,
5:17:004:0	and if it is told you and you have heard of it , then you shall inquire thoroughly . Behold , if it is true and the thing certain that this detestable thing has been done in Israel ,
5:17:005:0	then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil deed to your gates , that is , the man or the woman , and you shall stone them to death .
5:17:006:0	On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses , he who is to die shall be put to death ; he shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness .
5:17:007:0	The hand of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death , and afterward the hand of all the people . So you shall purge the evil from your midst .
5:17:008:0	“ If any case is too difficult for you to decide , between one kind of homicide or another , between one kind of lawsuit or another , and between one kind of assault or another , being cases of dispute in your courts , then you shall arise and go up to the place which the Lord your God chooses .
5:17:009:0	So you shall come to the Levitical priest or the judge who is in office in those days , and you shall inquire of them and they will declare to you the verdict in the case .
5:17:010:0	You shall do according to the terms of the verdict which they declare to you from that place which the Lord chooses ; and you shall be careful to observe according to all that they teach you .
5:17:011:0	According to the terms of the law which they teach you , and according to the verdict which they tell you , you shall do ; you shall not turn aside from the word which they declare to you , to the right or the left .
5:17:012:0	The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the Lord your God , nor to the judge , that man shall die ; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel .
5:17:013:0	Then all the people will hear and be afraid , and will not act presumptuously again .
5:17:014:0	“ When you enter the land which the Lord your God gives you , and you possess it and live in it , and you say , ‘I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me , ’
5:17:015:0	you shall surely set a king over you whom the Lord your God chooses , one from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves ; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman .
5:17:016:0	Moreover , he shall not multiply horses for himself , nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses , since the Lord has said to you , ‘You shall never again return that way . ’
5:17:017:0	He shall not multiply wives for himself , or else his heart will turn away ; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself .
5:17:018:0	“ Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom , he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests .
5:17:019:0	It shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life , that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes ,
5:17:020:0	that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen and that he may not turn aside from the commandment , to the right or the left , so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel .
