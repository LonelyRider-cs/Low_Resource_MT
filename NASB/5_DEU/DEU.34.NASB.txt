5:34:001:1	The Death of Moses
5:34:001:0	Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , which is opposite Jericho . And the Lord showed him all the land , Gilead as far as Dan ,
5:34:002:0	and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh , and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea ,
5:34:003:0	and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho , the city of palm trees , as far as Zoar .
5:34:004:0	Then the Lord said to him , “ This is the land which I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , saying , ‘I will give it to your descendants’ ; I have let you see it with your eyes , but you shall not go over there . ”
5:34:005:0	So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord .
5:34:006:0	And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab , opposite Beth-peor ; but no man knows his burial place to this day .
5:34:007:0	Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died , his eye was not dim , nor his vigor abated .
5:34:008:0	So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days ; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end .
5:34:009:0	Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom , for Moses had laid his hands on him ; and the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the Lord had commanded Moses .
5:34:010:0	Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face ,
5:34:011:0	for all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh , all his servants , and all his land ,
5:34:012:0	and for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel .
