5:10:001:1	The Tablets Rewritten
5:10:001:0	“ At that time the Lord said to me , ‘Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones , and come up to Me on the mountain , and make an ark of wood for yourself .
5:10:002:0	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered , and you shall put them in the ark . ’
5:10:003:0	So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the former ones , and went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand .
5:10:004:0	He wrote on the tablets , like the former writing , the Ten Commandments which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly ; and the Lord gave them to me .
5:10:005:0	Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made ; and there they are , as the Lord commanded me . ”
5:10:006:0	( Now the sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah . There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place .
5:10:007:0	From there they set out to Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land of brooks of water .
5:10:008:0	At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day .
5:10:009:0	Therefore , Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers ; the Lord is his inheritance , just as the Lord your God spoke to him . )
5:10:010:0	“ I , moreover , stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time , and the Lord listened to me that time also ; the Lord was not willing to destroy you .
5:10:011:0	Then the Lord said to me , ‘Arise , proceed on your journey ahead of the people , that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them . ’
5:10:012:0	“ Now , Israel , what does the Lord your God require from you , but to fear the Lord your God , to walk in all His ways and love Him , and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul ,
5:10:013:0	and to keep the Lord’s commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good ?
5:10:014:0	Behold , to the Lord your God belong heaven and the highest heavens , the earth and all that is in it .
5:10:015:0	Yet on your fathers did the Lord set His affection to love them , and He chose their descendants after them , even you above all peoples , as it is this day .
5:10:016:0	So circumcise your heart , and stiffen your neck no longer .
5:10:017:0	For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords , the great , the mighty , and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe .
5:10:018:0	He executes justice for the orphan and the widow , and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing .
5:10:019:0	So show your love for the alien , for you were aliens in the land of Egypt .
5:10:020:0	You shall fear the Lord your God ; you shall serve Him and cling to Him , and you shall swear by His name .
5:10:021:0	He is your praise and He is your God , who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen .
5:10:022:0	Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all , and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven .
