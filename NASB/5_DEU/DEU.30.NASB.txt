5:30:001:1	Restoration Promised
5:30:001:0	“ So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you , the blessing and the curse which I have set before you , and you call them to mind in all nations where the Lord your God has banished you ,
5:30:002:0	and you return to the Lord your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today , you and your sons ,
5:30:003:0	then the Lord your God will restore you from captivity , and have compassion on you , and will gather you again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you .
5:30:004:0	If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth , from there the Lord your God will gather you , and from there He will bring you back .
5:30:005:0	The Lord your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers .
5:30:006:0	“ Moreover the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants , to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul , so that you may live .
5:30:007:0	The Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you , who persecuted you .
5:30:008:0	And you shall again obey the Lord , and observe all His commandments which I command you today .
5:30:009:0	Then the Lord your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand , in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground , for the Lord will again rejoice over you for good , just as He rejoiced over your fathers ;
5:30:010:0	if you obey the Lord your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law , if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul .
5:30:011:0	“ For this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you , nor is it out of reach .
5:30:012:0	It is not in heaven , that you should say , ‘Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it , that we may observe it ? ’
5:30:013:0	Nor is it beyond the sea , that you should say , ‘Who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it , that we may observe it ? ’
5:30:002:1	Choose Life
5:30:014:0	But the word is very near you , in your mouth and in your heart , that you may observe it .
5:30:015:0	“ See , I have set before you today life and prosperity , and death and adversity ;
5:30:016:0	in that I command you today to love the Lord your God , to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments , that you may live and multiply , and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it .
5:30:017:0	But if your heart turns away and you will not obey , but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them ,
5:30:018:0	I declare to you today that you shall surely perish . You will not prolong your days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it .
5:30:019:0	I call heaven and earth to witness against you today , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse . So choose life in order that you may live , you and your descendants ,
5:30:020:0	by loving the Lord your God , by obeying His voice , and by holding fast to Him ; for this is your life and the length of your days , that you may live in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give them . ”
