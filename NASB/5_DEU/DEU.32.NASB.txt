5:32:001:1	The Song of Moses
5:32:001:0	“ Give ear , O heavens , and let me speak ; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth .
5:32:002:0	Let my teaching drop as the rain , My speech distill as the dew , As the droplets on the fresh grassAnd as the showers on the herb .
5:32:003:0	For I proclaim the name of the Lord ; Ascribe greatness to our God !
5:32:004:0	The Rock ! His work is perfect , For all His ways are just ; A God of faithfulness and without injustice , Righteous and upright is He .
5:32:005:0	They have acted corruptly toward Him , They are not His children , because of their defect ; But are a perverse and crooked generation .
5:32:006:0	Do you thus repay the Lord , O foolish and unwise people ? Is not He your Father who has bought you ? He has made you and established you .
5:32:007:0	Remember the days of old , Consider the years of all generations . Ask your father , and he will inform you , Your elders , and they will tell you .
5:32:008:0	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance , When He separated the sons of man , He set the boundaries of the peoplesAccording to the number of the sons of Israel .
5:32:009:0	For the Lord’s portion is His people ; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance .
5:32:010:0	He found him in a desert land , And in the howling waste of a wilderness ; He encircled him , He cared for him , He guarded him as the pupil of His eye .
5:32:011:0	Like an eagle that stirs up its nest , That hovers over its young , He spread His wings and caught them , He carried them on His pinions .
5:32:012:0	The Lord alone guided him , And there was no foreign god with him .
5:32:013:0	He made him ride on the high places of the earth , And he ate the produce of the field ; And He made him suck honey from the rock , And oil from the flinty rock ,
5:32:014:0	Curds of cows , and milk of the flock , With fat of lambs , And rams , the breed of Bashan , and goats , With the finest of the wheat—And of the blood of grapes you drank wine .
5:32:015:0	“ But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked—You are grown fat , thick , and sleek—Then he forsook God who made him , And scorned the Rock of his salvation .
5:32:016:0	They made Him jealous with strange gods ; With abominations they provoked Him to anger .
5:32:017:0	They sacrificed to demons who were not God , To gods whom they have not known , New gods who came lately , Whom your fathers did not dread .
5:32:018:0	You neglected the Rock who begot you , And forgot the God who gave you birth .
5:32:019:0	“ The Lord saw this , and spurned themBecause of the provocation of His sons and daughters .
5:32:020:0	Then He said , ‘I will hide My face from them , I will see what their end shall be ; For they are a perverse generation , Sons in whom is no faithfulness .
5:32:021:0	They have made Me jealous with what is not God ; They have provoked Me to anger with their idols . So I will make them jealous with those who are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation ,
5:32:022:0	For a fire is kindled in My anger , And burns to the lowest part of Sheol , And consumes the earth with its yield , And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains .
5:32:023:0	‘I will heap misfortunes on them ; I will use My arrows on them .
5:32:024:0	They will be wasted by famine , and consumed by plagueAnd bitter destruction ; And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them , With the venom of crawling things of the dust .
5:32:025:0	Outside the sword will bereave , And inside terror—Both young man and virgin , The nursling with the man of gray hair .
5:32:026:0	I would have said , “ I will cut them to pieces , I will remove the memory of them from men , ”
5:32:027:0	Had I not feared the provocation by the enemy , That their adversaries would misjudge , That they would say , “ Our hand is triumphant , And the Lord has not done all this . ” ’
5:32:028:0	“ For they are a nation lacking in counsel , And there is no understanding in them .
5:32:029:0	Would that they were wise , that they understood this , That they would discern their future !
5:32:030:0	How could one chase a thousand , And two put ten thousand to flight , Unless their Rock had sold them , And the Lord had given them up ?
5:32:031:0	Indeed their rock is not like our Rock , Even our enemies themselves judge this .
5:32:032:0	For their vine is from the vine of Sodom , And from the fields of Gomorrah ; Their grapes are grapes of poison , Their clusters , bitter .
5:32:033:0	Their wine is the venom of serpents , And the deadly poison of cobras .
5:32:034:0	‘Is it not laid up in store with Me , Sealed up in My treasuries ?
5:32:035:0	Vengeance is Mine , and retribution , In due time their foot will slip ; For the day of their calamity is near , And the impending things are hastening upon them . ’
5:32:036:0	For the Lord will vindicate His people , And will have compassion on His servants , When He sees that their strength is gone , And there is none remaining , bond or free .
5:32:037:0	And He will say , ‘Where are their gods , The rock in which they sought refuge ?
5:32:038:0	Who ate the fat of their sacrifices , And drank the wine of their drink offering ? Let them rise up and help you , Let them be your hiding place !
5:32:039:0	See now that I , I am He , And there is no god besides Me ; It is I who put to death and give life . I have wounded and it is I who heal , And there is no one who can deliver from My hand .
5:32:040:0	Indeed , I lift up My hand to heaven , And say , as I live forever ,
5:32:041:0	If I sharpen My flashing sword , And My hand takes hold on justice , I will render vengeance on My adversaries , And I will repay those who hate Me .
5:32:042:0	I will make My arrows drunk with blood , And My sword will devour flesh , With the blood of the slain and the captives , From the long-haired leaders of the enemy . ’
5:32:043:0	Rejoice , O nations , with His people ; For He will avenge the blood of His servants , And will render vengeance on His adversaries , And will atone for His land and His people . ”
5:32:044:0	Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people , he , with Joshua the son of Nun .
5:32:045:0	When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel ,
5:32:046:0	he said to them , “ Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today , which you shall command your sons to observe carefully , even all the words of this law .
5:32:047:0	For it is not an idle word for you ; indeed it is your life . And by this word you will prolong your days in the land , which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess . ”
5:32:048:0	The Lord spoke to Moses that very same day , saying ,
5:32:049:0	“ Go up to this mountain of the Abarim , Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho , and look at the land of Canaan , which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession .
5:32:050:0	Then die on the mountain where you ascend , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people ,
5:32:051:0	because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin , because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel .
5:32:052:0	For you shall see the land at a distance , but you shall not go there , into the land which I am giving the sons of Israel . ”
