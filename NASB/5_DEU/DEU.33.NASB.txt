5:33:001:1	The Blessing of Moses
5:33:001:0	Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death .
5:33:002:0	He said , “ The Lord came from Sinai , And dawned on them from Seir ; He shone forth from Mount Paran , And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones ; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them .
5:33:003:0	Indeed , He loves the people ; All Your holy ones are in Your hand , And they followed in Your steps ; Everyone receives of Your words .
5:33:004:0	Moses charged us with a law , A possession for the assembly of Jacob .
5:33:005:0	And He was king in Jeshurun , When the heads of the people were gathered , The tribes of Israel together .
5:33:006:0	“ May Reuben live and not die , Nor his men be few . ”
5:33:007:0	And this regarding Judah ; so he said , “ Hear , O Lord , the voice of Judah , And bring him to his people . With his hands he contended for them , And may You be a help against his adversaries . ”
5:33:008:0	Of Levi he said , “ Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to Your godly man , Whom You proved at Massah , With whom You contended at the waters of Meribah ;
5:33:009:0	Who said of his father and his mother , ‘I did not consider them’ ; And he did not acknowledge his brothers , Nor did he regard his own sons , For they observed Your word , And kept Your covenant .
5:33:010:0	They shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob , And Your law to Israel . They shall put incense before You , And whole burnt offerings on Your altar .
5:33:011:0	O Lord , bless his substance , And accept the work of his hands ; Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him , And those who hate him , so that they will not rise again . ”
5:33:012:0	Of Benjamin he said , “ May the beloved of the Lord dwell in security by Him , Who shields him all the day , And he dwells between His shoulders . ”
5:33:013:0	Of Joseph he said , “ Blessed of the Lord be his land , With the choice things of heaven , with the dew , And from the deep lying beneath ,
5:33:014:0	And with the choice yield of the sun , And with the choice produce of the months .
5:33:015:0	And with the best things of the ancient mountains , And with the choice things of the everlasting hills ,
5:33:016:0	And with the choice things of the earth and its fullness , And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush . Let it come to the head of Joseph , And to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers .
5:33:017:0	As the firstborn of his ox , majesty is his , And his horns are the horns of the wild ox ; With them he will push the peoples , All at once , to the ends of the earth . And those are the ten thousands of Ephraim , And those are the thousands of Manasseh . ”
5:33:018:0	Of Zebulun he said , “ Rejoice , Zebulun , in your going forth , And , Issachar , in your tents .
5:33:019:0	They will call peoples to the mountain ; There they will offer righteous sacrifices ; For they will draw out the abundance of the seas , And the hidden treasures of the sand . ”
5:33:020:0	Of Gad he said , “ Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad ; He lies down as a lion , And tears the arm , also the crown of the head .
5:33:021:0	Then he provided the first part for himself , For there the ruler’s portion was reserved ; And he came with the leaders of the people ; He executed the justice of the Lord , And His ordinances with Israel . ”
5:33:022:0	Of Dan he said , “ Dan is a lion’s whelp , That leaps forth from Bashan . ”
5:33:023:0	Of Naphtali he said , “ O Naphtali , satisfied with favor , And full of the blessing of the Lord , Take possession of the sea and the south . ”
5:33:024:0	Of Asher he said , “ More blessed than sons is Asher ; May he be favored by his brothers , And may he dip his foot in oil .
5:33:025:0	Your locks will be iron and bronze , And according to your days , so will your leisurely walk be .
5:33:026:0	“ There is none like the God of Jeshurun , Who rides the heavens to your help , And through the skies in His majesty .
5:33:027:0	The eternal God is a dwelling place , And underneath are the everlasting arms ; And He drove out the enemy from before you , And said , ‘Destroy ! ’
5:33:028:0	So Israel dwells in security , The fountain of Jacob secluded , In a land of grain and new wine ; His heavens also drop down dew .
5:33:029:0	Blessed are you , O Israel ; Who is like you , a people saved by the Lord , Who is the shield of your helpAnd the sword of your majesty ! So your enemies will cringe before you , And you will tread upon their high places . ”
