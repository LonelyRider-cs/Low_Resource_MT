5:19:001:1	Cities of Refuge
5:19:001:0	“ When the Lord your God cuts off the nations , whose land the Lord your God gives you , and you dispossess them and settle in their cities and in their houses ,
5:19:002:0	you shall set aside three cities for yourself in the midst of your land , which the Lord your God gives you to possess .
5:19:003:0	You shall prepare the roads for yourself , and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the Lord your God will give you as a possession , so that any manslayer may flee there .
5:19:004:0	“ Now this is the case of the manslayer who may flee there and live : when he kills his friend unintentionally , not hating him previously—
5:19:005:0	as when a man goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood , and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree , and the iron head slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies—he may flee to one of these cities and live ;
5:19:006:0	otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in the heat of his anger , and overtake him , because the way is long , and take his life , though he was not deserving of death , since he had not hated him previously .
5:19:007:0	Therefore , I command you , saying , ‘You shall set aside three cities for yourself . ’
5:19:008:0	“ If the Lord your God enlarges your territory , just as He has sworn to your fathers , and gives you all the land which He promised to give your fathers—
5:19:009:0	if you carefully observe all this commandment which I command you today , to love the Lord your God , and to walk in His ways always—then you shall add three more cities for yourself , besides these three .
5:19:010:0	So innocent blood will not be shed in the midst of your land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance , and bloodguiltiness be on you .
5:19:011:0	“ But if there is a man who hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and rises up against him and strikes him so that he dies , and he flees to one of these cities ,
5:19:012:0	then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
5:19:002:1	Laws of Landmark and Testimony
5:19:013:0	You shall not pity him , but you shall purge the blood of the innocent from Israel , that it may go well with you .
5:19:014:0	“ You shall not move your neighbor’s boundary mark , which the ancestors have set , in your inheritance which you will inherit in the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess .
5:19:015:0	“ A single witness shall not rise up against a man on account of any iniquity or any sin which he has committed ; on the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed .
5:19:016:0	If a malicious witness rises up against a man to accuse him of wrongdoing ,
5:19:017:0	then both the men who have the dispute shall stand before the Lord , before the priests and the judges who will be in office in those days .
5:19:018:0	The judges shall investigate thoroughly , and if the witness is a false witness and he has accused his brother falsely ,
5:19:019:0	then you shall do to him just as he had intended to do to his brother . Thus you shall purge the evil from among you .
5:19:020:0	The rest will hear and be afraid , and will never again do such an evil thing among you .
5:19:021:0	Thus you shall not show pity : life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
