5:18:001:1	Portion of the Levites
5:18:001:0	“ The Levitical priests , the whole tribe of Levi , shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel ; they shall eat the Lord’s offerings by fire and His portion .
5:18:002:0	They shall have no inheritance among their countrymen ; the Lord is their inheritance , as He promised them .
5:18:003:0	“ Now this shall be the priests’ due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , either an ox or a sheep , of which they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach .
5:18:004:0	You shall give him the first fruits of your grain , your new wine , and your oil , and the first shearing of your sheep .
5:18:005:0	For the Lord your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes , to stand and serve in the name of the Lord forever .
5:18:006:0	“ Now if a Levite comes from any of your towns throughout Israel where he resides , and comes whenever he desires to the place which the Lord chooses ,
5:18:007:0	then he shall serve in the name of the Lord his God , like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the Lord .
5:18:002:1	Spiritism Forbidden
5:18:008:0	They shall eat equal portions , except what they receive from the sale of their fathers’ estates .
5:18:009:0	“ When you enter the land which the Lord your God gives you , you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations .
5:18:010:0	There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire , one who uses divination , one who practices witchcraft , or one who interprets omens , or a sorcerer ,
5:18:011:0	or one who casts a spell , or a medium , or a spiritist , or one who calls up the dead .
5:18:012:0	For whoever does these things is detestable to the Lord ; and because of these detestable things the Lord your God will drive them out before you .
5:18:013:0	You shall be blameless before the Lord your God .
5:18:014:0	For those nations , which you shall dispossess , listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners , but as for you , the Lord your God has not allowed you to do so .
5:18:015:0	“ The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you , from your countrymen , you shall listen to him .
5:18:016:0	This is according to all that you asked of the Lord your God in Horeb on the day of the assembly , saying , ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , let me not see this great fire anymore , or I will die . ’
5:18:017:0	The Lord said to me , ‘They have spoken well .
5:18:018:0	I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you , and I will put My words in his mouth , and he shall speak to them all that I command him .
5:18:019:0	It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name , I Myself will require it of him .
5:18:020:0	But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak , or which he speaks in the name of other gods , that prophet shall die . ’
5:18:021:0	You may say in your heart , ‘How will we know the word which the Lord has not spoken ? ’
5:18:022:0	When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord , if the thing does not come about or come true , that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken . The prophet has spoken it presumptuously ; you shall not be afraid of him .
