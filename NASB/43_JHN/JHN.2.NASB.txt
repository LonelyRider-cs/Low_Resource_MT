43:2:001:1	Miracle at Cana
43:2:001:0	On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there ;
43:2:002:0	and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding .
43:2:003:0	When the wine ran out , the mother of Jesus *said to Him , “ They have no wine . ”
43:2:004:0	And Jesus *said to her , “ Woman , what does that have to do with us ? My hour has not yet come . ”
43:2:005:0	His mother *said to the servants , “ Whatever He says to you , do it . ”
43:2:006:0	Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification , containing twenty or thirty gallons each .
43:2:007:0	Jesus *said to them , “ Fill the waterpots with water . ” So they filled them up to the brim .
43:2:008:0	And He *said to them , “ Draw out now and take it to the headwaiter . ” So they took it to him .
43:2:009:0	When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine , and did not know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the headwaiter *called the bridegroom ,
43:2:010:0	and *said to him , “ Every man serves the good wine first , and when the people have drunk freely , then he serves the poorer wine ; but you have kept the good wine until now . ”
43:2:011:0	This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee , and manifested His glory , and His disciples believed in Him .
43:2:002:1	First Passover—Cleansing the Temple
43:2:012:0	After this He went down to Capernaum , He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples ; and they stayed there a few days .
43:2:013:0	The Passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43:2:014:0	And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers seated at their tables .
43:2:015:0	And He made a scourge of cords , and drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and the oxen ; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables ;
43:2:016:0	and to those who were selling the doves He said , “ Take these things away ; stop making My Father’s house a place of business . ”
43:2:017:0	His disciples remembered that it was written , “ Zeal for Your house will consume me . ”
43:2:018:0	The Jews then said to Him , “ What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things ? ”
43:2:019:0	Jesus answered them , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . ”
43:2:020:0	The Jews then said , “ It took forty-six years to build this temple , and will You raise it up in three days ? ”
43:2:021:0	But He was speaking of the temple of His body .
43:2:022:0	So when He was raised from the dead , His disciples remembered that He said this ; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken .
43:2:023:0	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover , during the feast , many believed in His name , observing His signs which He was doing .
43:2:024:0	But Jesus , on His part , was not entrusting Himself to them , for He knew all men ,
43:2:025:0	and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man , for He Himself knew what was in man .
