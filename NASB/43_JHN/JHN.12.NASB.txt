43:12:001:1	Mary Anoints Jesus
43:12:001:0	Jesus , therefore , six days before the Passover , came to Bethany where Lazarus was , whom Jesus had raised from the dead .
43:12:002:0	So they made Him a supper there , and Martha was serving ; but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him .
43:12:003:0	Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard , and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair ; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43:12:004:0	But Judas Iscariot , one of His disciples , who was intending to betray Him , *said ,
43:12:005:0	“ Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people ? ”
43:12:006:0	Now he said this , not because he was concerned about the poor , but because he was a thief , and as he had the money box , he used to pilfer what was put into it .
43:12:007:0	Therefore Jesus said , “ Let her alone , so that she may keep it for the day of My burial .
43:12:008:0	For you always have the poor with you , but you do not always have Me . ”
43:12:009:0	The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there ; and they came , not for Jesus’ sake only , but that they might also see Lazarus , whom He raised from the dead .
43:12:010:0	But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also ;
43:12:002:1	Jesus Enters Jerusalem
43:12:011:0	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus .
43:12:012:0	On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
43:12:013:0	took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him , and began to shout , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel . ”
43:12:014:0	Jesus , finding a young donkey , sat on it ; as it is written ,
43:12:015:0	“ Fear not , daughter of Zion ; behold , your King is coming , seated on a donkey’s colt . ”
43:12:016:0	These things His disciples did not understand at the first ; but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written of Him , and that they had done these things to Him .
43:12:017:0	So the people , who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead , continued to testify about Him .
43:12:018:0	For this reason also the people went and met Him , because they heard that He had performed this sign .
43:12:003:1	Greeks Seek Jesus
43:12:019:0	So the Pharisees said to one another , “ You see that you are not doing any good ; look , the world has gone after Him . ”
43:12:020:0	Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast ;
43:12:021:0	these then came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida of Galilee , and began to ask him , saying , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus . ”
43:12:022:0	Philip *came and *told Andrew ; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus .
43:12:023:0	And Jesus *answered them , saying , “ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43:12:024:0	Truly , truly , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
43:12:025:0	He who loves his life loses it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal .
43:12:004:1	Jesus Foretells His Death
43:12:026:0	If anyone serves Me , he must follow Me ; and where I am , there My servant will be also ; if anyone serves Me , the Father will honor him .
43:12:027:0	“ Now My soul has become troubled ; and what shall I say , ‘Father , save Me from this hour’ ? But for this purpose I came to this hour .
43:12:028:0	Father , glorify Your name . ” Then a voice came out of heaven : “ I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . ”
43:12:029:0	So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered ; others were saying , “ An angel has spoken to Him . ”
43:12:030:0	Jesus answered and said , “ This voice has not come for My sake , but for your sakes .
43:12:031:0	Now judgment is upon this world ; now the ruler of this world will be cast out .
43:12:032:0	And I , if I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to Myself . ”
43:12:033:0	But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die .
43:12:034:0	The crowd then answered Him , “ We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever ; and how can You say , ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’ ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43:12:035:0	So Jesus said to them , “ For a little while longer the Light is among you . Walk while you have the Light , so that darkness will not overtake you ; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes .
43:12:036:0	While you have the Light , believe in the Light , so that you may become sons of Light . ” These things Jesus spoke , and He went away and hid Himself from them .
43:12:037:0	But though He had performed so many signs before them , yet they were not believing in Him .
43:12:038:0	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke : “ Lord , who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
43:12:039:0	For this reason they could not believe , for Isaiah said again ,
43:12:040:0	“ He has blinded their eyes and He hardened their heart , so that they would not see with their eyes and perceive with their heart , and be converted and I heal them . ”
43:12:041:0	These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory , and he spoke of Him .
43:12:042:0	Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him , but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him , for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue ;
43:12:043:0	for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God .
43:12:044:0	And Jesus cried out and said , “ He who believes in Me , does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me .
43:12:045:0	He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me .
43:12:046:0	I have come Light into the world , so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness .
43:12:047:0	If anyone hears My sayings and does not keep them , I do not judge him ; for I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
43:12:048:0	He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings , has one who judges him ; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day .
43:12:049:0	For I did not speak on My own initiative , but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment what to say and what to speak .
43:12:050:0	I know that His commandment is eternal life ; therefore the things I speak , I speak just as the Father has told Me . ”
