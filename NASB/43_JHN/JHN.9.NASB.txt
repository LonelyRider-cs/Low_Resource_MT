43:9:001:1	Healing the Man Born Blind
43:9:001:0	As He passed by , He saw a man blind from birth .
43:9:002:0	And His disciples asked Him , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he would be born blind ? ”
43:9:003:0	Jesus answered , “ neither this man sinned , nor his parents ; but so that the works of God might be displayed in him .
43:9:004:0	We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day ; night is coming when no one can work .
43:9:005:0	While I am in the world , I am the Light of the world . ”
43:9:006:0	When He had said this , He spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and applied the clay to his eyes ,
43:9:007:0	and said to him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated , Sent ) . So he went away and washed , and came back seeing .
43:9:008:0	Therefore the neighbors , and those who previously saw him as a beggar , were saying , “ Is not this the one who used to sit and beg ? ”
43:9:009:0	Others were saying , “ This is he , ” still others were saying , “ No , but he is like him . ” He kept saying , “ I am the one . ”
43:9:010:0	So they were saying to him , “ How then were your eyes opened ? ”
43:9:011:0	He answered , “ The man who is called Jesus made clay , and anointed my eyes , and said to me , ‘Go to Siloam and wash’ ; so I went away and washed , and I received sight . ”
43:9:002:1	Controversy over the Man
43:9:012:0	They said to him , “ Where is He ? ” He *said , “ I do not know . ”
43:9:013:0	They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind .
43:9:014:0	Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
43:9:015:0	Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight . And he said to them , “ He applied clay to my eyes , and I washed , and I see . ”
43:9:016:0	Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man is not from God , because He does not keep the Sabbath . ” But others were saying , “ How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs ? ” And there was a division among them .
43:9:017:0	So they *said to the blind man again , “ What do you say about Him , since He opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ He is a prophet . ”
43:9:018:0	The Jews then did not believe it of him , that he had been blind and had received sight , until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight ,
43:9:019:0	and questioned them , saying , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
43:9:020:0	His parents answered them and said , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
43:9:021:0	but how he now sees , we do not know ; or who opened his eyes , we do not know . Ask him ; he is of age , he will speak for himself . ”
43:9:022:0	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ , he was to be put out of the synagogue .
43:9:023:0	For this reason his parents said , “ He is of age ; ask him . ”
43:9:024:0	So a second time they called the man who had been blind , and said to him , “ Give glory to God ; we know that this man is a sinner . ”
43:9:025:0	He then answered , “ Whether He is a sinner , I do not know ; one thing I do know , that though I was blind , now I see . ”
43:9:026:0	So they said to him , “ What did He do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
43:9:027:0	He answered them , “ I told you already and you did not listen ; why do you want to hear it again ? You do not want to become His disciples too , do you ? ”
43:9:028:0	They reviled him and said , “ You are His disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
43:9:029:0	We know that God has spoken to Moses , but as for this man , we do not know where He is from . ”
43:9:030:0	The man answered and said to them , “ Well , here is an amazing thing , that you do not know where He is from , and yet He opened my eyes .
43:9:031:0	We know that God does not hear sinners ; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will , He hears him .
43:9:032:0	Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind .
43:9:033:0	If this man were not from God , He could do nothing . ”
43:9:003:1	Jesus Affirms His Deity
43:9:034:0	They answered him , “ You were born entirely in sins , and are you teaching us ? ” So they put him out .
43:9:035:0	Jesus heard that they had put him out , and finding him , He said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43:9:036:0	He answered , “ Who is He , Lord , that I may believe in Him ? ”
43:9:037:0	Jesus said to him , “ You have both seen Him , and He is the one who is talking with you . ”
43:9:038:0	And he said , “ Lord , I believe . ” And he worshiped Him .
43:9:039:0	And Jesus said , “ For judgment I came into this world , so that those who do not see may see , and that those who see may become blind . ”
43:9:040:0	Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him , “ We are not blind too , are we ? ”
43:9:041:0	Jesus said to them , “ If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but since you say , ‘We see , ’ your sin remains .
