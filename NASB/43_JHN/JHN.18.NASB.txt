43:18:001:1	Judas Betrays Jesus
43:18:001:0	When Jesus had spoken these words , He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron , where there was a garden , in which He entered with His disciples .
43:18:002:0	Now Judas also , who was betraying Him , knew the place , for Jesus had often met there with His disciples .
43:18:003:0	Judas then , having received the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , *came there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
43:18:004:0	So Jesus , knowing all the things that were coming upon Him , went forth and *said to them , “ Whom do you seek ? ”
43:18:005:0	They answered Him , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ” He *said to them , “ I am ” And Judas also , who was betraying Him , was standing with them .
43:18:006:0	So when He said to them , “ I am ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
43:18:007:0	Therefore He again asked them , “ Whom do you seek ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ”
43:18:008:0	Jesus answered , “ I told you that I am so if you seek Me , let these go their way , ”
43:18:009:0	to fulfill the word which He spoke , “ Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one . ”
43:18:010:0	Simon Peter then , having a sword , drew it and struck the high priest’s slave , and cut off his right ear ; and the slave’s name was Malchus .
43:18:002:1	Jesus before the Priests
43:18:011:0	So Jesus said to Peter , “ Put the sword into the sheath ; the cup which the Father has given Me , shall I not drink it ? ”
43:18:012:0	So the Roman cohort and the commander and the officers of the Jews , arrested Jesus and bound Him ,
43:18:013:0	and led Him to Annas first ; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
43:18:014:0	Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people .
43:18:015:0	Simon Peter was following Jesus , and so was another disciple . Now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest ,
43:18:016:0	but Peter was standing at the door outside . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the doorkeeper , and brought Peter in .
43:18:017:0	Then the slave-girl who kept the door *said to Peter , “ You are not also one of this man’s disciples , are you ? ” He *said , “ I am not . ”
43:18:018:0	Now the slaves and the officers were standing there , having made a charcoal fire , for it was cold and they were warming themselves ; and Peter was also with them , standing and warming himself .
43:18:019:0	The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples , and about His teaching .
43:18:020:0	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken openly to the world ; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple , where all the Jews come together ; and I spoke nothing in secret .
43:18:021:0	Why do you question Me ? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them ; they know what I said . ”
43:18:022:0	When He had said this , one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus , saying , “ Is that the way You answer the high priest ? ”
43:18:023:0	Jesus answered him , “ If I have spoken wrongly , testify of the wrong ; but if rightly , why do you strike Me ? ”
43:18:003:1	Peter’s Denial of Jesus
43:18:024:0	So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
43:18:025:0	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . So they said to him , “ You are not also one of His disciples , are you ? ” He denied it , and said , “ I am not . ”
43:18:026:0	One of the slaves of the high priest , being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off , *said , “ Did I not see you in the garden with Him ? ”
43:18:004:1	Jesus before Pilate
43:18:027:0	Peter then denied it again , and immediately a rooster crowed .
43:18:028:0	Then they *led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium , and it was early ; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they would not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
43:18:029:0	Therefore Pilate went out to them and *said , “ What accusation do you bring against this Man ? ”
43:18:030:0	They answered and said to him , “ If this Man were not an evildoer , we would not have delivered Him to you . ”
43:18:031:0	So Pilate said to them , “ Take Him yourselves , and judge Him according to your law . ” The Jews said to him , “ We are not permitted to put anyone to death , ”
43:18:032:0	to fulfill the word of Jesus which He spoke , signifying by what kind of death He was about to die .
43:18:033:0	Therefore Pilate entered again into the Praetorium , and summoned Jesus and said to Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ”
43:18:034:0	Jesus answered , “ Are you saying this on your own initiative , or did others tell you about Me ? ”
43:18:035:0	Pilate answered , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You to me ; what have You done ? ”
43:18:036:0	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom is not of this world . If My kingdom were of this world , then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews ; but as it is , My kingdom is not of this realm . ”
43:18:037:0	Therefore Pilate said to Him , “ So You are a king ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say that I am a king . For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , to testify to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice . ”
43:18:038:0	Pilate *said to Him , “ What is truth ? ” And when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews and *said to them , “ I find no guilt in Him .
43:18:039:0	But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover ; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews ? ”
43:18:040:0	So they cried out again , saying , “ Not this Man , but Barabbas . ” Now Barabbas was a robber .
