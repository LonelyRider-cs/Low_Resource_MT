43:3:001:1	The New Birth
43:3:001:0	Now there was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews ;
43:3:002:0	this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him , “ Rabbi , we know that You have come from God as a teacher ; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him . ”
43:3:003:0	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God . ”
43:3:004:0	Nicodemus *said to Him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born , can he ? ”
43:3:005:0	Jesus answered , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
43:3:006:0	That which is born of the flesh is flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43:3:007:0	Do not be amazed that I said to you , ‘You must be born again . ’
43:3:008:0	The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it , but do not know where it comes from and where it is going ; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit . ”
43:3:009:0	Nicodemus said to Him , “ How can these things be ? ”
43:3:010:0	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things ?
43:3:011:0	Truly , truly , I say to you , we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen , and you do not accept our testimony .
43:3:012:0	If I told you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
43:3:013:0	No one has ascended into heaven , but He who descended from heaven : the Son of Man .
43:3:014:0	As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ;
43:3:015:0	so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life .
43:3:016:0	“ For God so loved the world , that He gave His only begotten Son , that whoever believes in Him shall not perish , but have eternal life .
43:3:017:0	For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world might be saved through Him .
43:3:018:0	He who believes in Him is not judged ; he who does not believe has been judged already , because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
43:3:019:0	This is the judgment , that the Light has come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the Light , for their deeds were evil .
43:3:020:0	For everyone who does evil hates the Light , and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed .
43:3:002:1	John’s Last Testimony
43:3:021:0	But he who practices the truth comes to the Light , so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God . ”
43:3:022:0	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea , and there He was spending time with them and baptizing .
43:3:023:0	John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim , because there was much water there ; and people were coming and were being baptized—
43:3:024:0	for John had not yet been thrown into prison .
43:3:025:0	Therefore there arose a discussion on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification .
43:3:026:0	And they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , He who was with you beyond the Jordan , to whom you have testified , behold , He is baptizing and all are coming to Him . ”
43:3:027:0	John answered and said , “ A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven .
43:3:028:0	You yourselves are my witnesses that I said , ‘I am not the Christ , ’ but , ‘I have been sent ahead of Him . ’
43:3:029:0	He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice . So this joy of mine has been made full .
43:3:030:0	He must increase , but I must decrease .
43:3:031:0	“ He who comes from above is above all , he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth . He who comes from heaven is above all .
43:3:032:0	What He has seen and heard , of that He testifies ; and no one receives His testimony .
43:3:033:0	He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this , that God is true .
43:3:034:0	For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God ; for He gives the Spirit without measure .
43:3:035:0	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand .
43:3:036:0	He who believes in the Son has eternal life ; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God abides on him . ”
