43:20:001:1	The Empty Tomb
43:20:001:0	Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb , while it *was still dark , and *saw the stone already taken away from the tomb .
43:20:002:0	So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and *said to them , “ They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid Him . ”
43:20:003:0	So Peter and the other disciple went forth , and they were going to the tomb .
43:20:004:0	The two were running together ; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first ;
43:20:005:0	and stooping and looking in , he *saw the linen wrappings lying there ; but he did not go in .
43:20:006:0	And so Simon Peter also *came , following him , and entered the tomb ; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying there ,
43:20:007:0	and the face-cloth which had been on His head , not lying with the linen wrappings , but rolled up in a place by itself .
43:20:008:0	So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered , and he saw and believed .
43:20:009:0	For as yet they did not understand the Scripture , that He must rise again from the dead .
43:20:010:0	So the disciples went away again to their own homes .
43:20:011:0	But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping ; and so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ;
43:20:012:0	and she *saw two angels in white sitting , one at the head and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had been lying .
43:20:013:0	And they *said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She *said to them , “ Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid Him . ”
43:20:014:0	When she had said this , she turned around and *saw Jesus standing there , and did not know that it was Jesus .
43:20:015:0	Jesus *said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? ” Supposing Him to be the gardener , she *said to Him , “ Sir , if you have carried Him away , tell me where you have laid Him , and I will take Him away . ”
43:20:016:0	Jesus *said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and *said to Him in Hebrew , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means , Teacher ) .
43:20:017:0	Jesus *said to her , “ Stop clinging to Me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father ; but go to My brethren and say to them , ‘I ascend to My Father and your Father , and My God and your God . ’ ”
43:20:002:1	Jesus among His Disciples
43:20:018:0	Mary Magdalene *came , announcing to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord , ” and that He had said these things to her .
43:20:019:0	So when it was evening on that day , the first day of the week , and when the doors were shut where the disciples were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in their midst and *said to them , “ Peace with you . ”
43:20:020:0	And when He had said this , He showed them both His hands and His side . The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord .
43:20:021:0	So Jesus said to them again , “ Peace with you ; as the Father has sent Me , I also send you . ”
43:20:022:0	And when He had said this , He breathed on them and *said to them , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43:20:023:0	If you forgive the sins of any , have been forgiven them ; if you retain the of any , they have been retained . ”
43:20:024:0	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
43:20:025:0	So the other disciples were saying to him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails , and put my finger into the place of the nails , and put my hand into His side , I will not believe . ”
43:20:026:0	After eight days His disciples were again inside , and Thomas with them . Jesus *came , the doors having been shut , and stood in their midst and said , “ Peace with you . ”
43:20:027:0	Then He *said to Thomas , “ Reach here with your finger , and see My hands ; and reach here your hand and put it into My side ; and do not be unbelieving , but believing . ”
43:20:028:0	Thomas answered and said to Him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
43:20:003:1	Why This Gospel Was Written
43:20:029:0	Jesus *said to him , “ Because you have seen Me , have you believed ? Blessed they who did not see , and believed . ”
43:20:030:0	Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book ;
43:20:031:0	but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing you may have life in His name .
