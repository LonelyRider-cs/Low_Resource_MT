43:6:001:1	Five Thousand Fed
43:6:001:0	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee ( or Tiberias ) .
43:6:002:0	A large crowd followed Him , because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick .
43:6:003:0	Then Jesus went up on the mountain , and there He sat down with His disciples .
43:6:004:0	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was near .
43:6:005:0	Therefore Jesus , lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him , *said to Philip , “ Where are we to buy bread , so that these may eat ? ”
43:6:006:0	This He was saying to test him , for He Himself knew what He was intending to do .
43:6:007:0	Philip answered Him , “ Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them , for everyone to receive a little . ”
43:6:008:0	One of His disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , *said to Him ,
43:6:009:0	“ There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish , but what are these for so many people ? ”
43:6:010:0	Jesus said , “ Have the people sit down . ” Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
43:6:011:0	Jesus then took the loaves , and having given thanks , He distributed to those who were seated ; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted .
43:6:012:0	When they were filled , He *said to His disciples , “ Gather up the leftover fragments so that nothing will be lost . ”
43:6:013:0	So they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten .
43:6:002:1	Jesus Walks on the Water
43:6:014:0	Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed , they said , “ This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world . ”
43:6:015:0	So Jesus , perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him king , withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone .
43:6:016:0	Now when evening came , His disciples went down to the sea ,
43:6:017:0	and after getting into a boat , they started to cross the sea to Capernaum . It had already become dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
43:6:018:0	The sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing .
43:6:019:0	Then , when they had rowed about three or four miles , they *saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat ; and they were frightened .
43:6:020:0	But He *said to them , “ It is I ; do not be afraid . ”
43:6:021:0	So they were willing to receive Him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going .
43:6:022:0	The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there , except one , and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat , but that His disciples had gone away alone .
43:6:023:0	There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43:6:024:0	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor His disciples , they themselves got into the small boats , and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus .
43:6:003:1	Words to the People
43:6:025:0	When they found Him on the other side of the sea , they said to Him , “ Rabbi , when did You get here ? ”
43:6:026:0	Jesus answered them and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you seek Me , not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves and were filled .
43:6:027:0	Do not work for the food which perishes , but for the food which endures to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you , for on Him the Father , God , has set His seal . ”
43:6:028:0	Therefore they said to Him , “ What shall we do , so that we may work the works of God ? ”
43:6:029:0	Jesus answered and said to them , “ This is the work of God , that you believe in Him whom He has sent . ”
43:6:030:0	So they said to Him , “ What then do You do for a sign , so that we may see , and believe You ? What work do You perform ?
43:6:031:0	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . ’ ”
43:6:032:0	Jesus then said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven , but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven .
43:6:033:0	For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . ”
43:6:034:0	Then they said to Him , “ Lord , always give us this bread . ”
43:6:035:0	Jesus said to them , “ I am the bread of life ; he who comes to Me will not hunger , and he who believes in Me will never thirst .
43:6:036:0	But I said to you that you have seen Me , and yet do not believe .
43:6:037:0	All that the Father gives Me will come to Me , and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out .
43:6:038:0	For I have come down from heaven , not to do My own will , but the will of Him who sent Me .
43:6:039:0	This is the will of Him who sent Me , that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing , but raise it up on the last day .
43:6:004:1	Words to the Jews
43:6:040:0	For this is the will of My Father , that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life , and I Myself will raise him up on the last day . ”
43:6:041:0	Therefore the Jews were grumbling about Him , because He said , “ I am the bread that came down out of heaven . ”
43:6:042:0	They were saying , “ Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How does He now say , ‘I have come down out of heaven’ ? ”
43:6:043:0	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Do not grumble among yourselves .
43:6:044:0	No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him ; and I will raise him up on the last day .
43:6:045:0	It is written in the prophets , ‘A G . ’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father , comes to Me .
43:6:046:0	Not that anyone has seen the Father , except the One who is from God ; He has seen the Father .
43:6:047:0	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes has eternal life .
43:6:048:0	I am the bread of life .
43:6:049:0	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
43:6:050:0	This is the bread which comes down out of heaven , so that one may eat of it and not die .
43:6:051:0	I am the living bread that came down out of heaven ; if anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever ; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh . ”
43:6:052:0	Then the Jews began to argue with one another , saying , “ How can this man give us His flesh to eat ? ”
43:6:053:0	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood , you have no life in yourselves .
43:6:054:0	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43:6:055:0	For My flesh is true food , and My blood is true drink .
43:6:056:0	He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me , and I in him .
43:6:057:0	As the living Father sent Me , and I live because of the Father , so he who eats Me , he also will live because of Me .
43:6:005:1	Words to the Disciples
43:6:058:0	This is the bread which came down out of heaven ; not as the fathers ate and died ; he who eats this bread will live forever . ”
43:6:059:0	These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum .
43:6:060:0	Therefore many of His disciples , when they heard this said , “ This is a difficult statement ; who can listen to it ? ”
43:6:061:0	But Jesus , conscious that His disciples grumbled at this , said to them , “ Does this cause you to stumble ?
43:6:062:0	then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before ?
43:6:063:0	It is the Spirit who gives life ; the flesh profits nothing ; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life .
43:6:064:0	But there are some of you who do not believe . ” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who it was that would betray Him .
43:6:006:1	Peter’s Confession of Faith
43:6:065:0	And He was saying , “ For this reason I have said to you , that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father . ”
43:6:066:0	As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore .
43:6:067:0	So Jesus said to the twelve , “ You do not want to go away also , do you ? ”
43:6:068:0	Simon Peter answered Him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have words of eternal life .
43:6:069:0	We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God . ”
43:6:070:0	Jesus answered them , “ Did I Myself not choose you , the twelve , and one of you is a devil ? ”
43:6:071:0	Now He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot , for he , one of the twelve , was going to betray Him .
