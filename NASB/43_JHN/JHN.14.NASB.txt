43:14:001:1	Jesus Comforts His Disciples
43:14:001:0	“ Do not let your heart be troubled ; believe in God , believe also in Me .
43:14:002:0	In My Father’s house are many dwelling places ; if it were not so , I would have told you ; for I go to prepare a place for you .
43:14:003:0	If I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and receive you to Myself , that where I am , you may be also .
43:14:004:0	And you know the way where I am going . ”
43:14:005:0	Thomas *said to Him , “ Lord , we do not know where You are going , how do we know the way ? ”
43:14:002:1	Oneness with the Father
43:14:006:0	Jesus *said to him , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life ; no one comes to the Father but through Me .
43:14:007:0	If you had known Me , you would have known My Father also ; from now on you know Him , and have seen Him . ”
43:14:008:0	Philip *said to Him , “ Lord , show us the Father , and it is enough for us . ”
43:14:009:0	Jesus *said to him , “ Have I been so long with you , and you have not come to know Me , Philip ? He who has seen Me has seen the Father ; how you say , ‘Show us the Father’ ?
43:14:010:0	Do you not believe that I am in the Father , and the Father is in Me ? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative , but the Father abiding in Me does His works .
43:14:011:0	Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me ; otherwise believe because of the works themselves .
43:14:012:0	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes in Me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and greater than these he will do ; because I go to the Father .
43:14:013:0	Whatever you ask in My name , that will I do , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43:14:014:0	If you ask Me anything in My name , I will do
43:14:003:1	Role of the Spirit
43:14:015:0	“ If you love Me , you will keep My commandments .
43:14:016:0	I will ask the Father , and He will give you another Helper , that He may be with you forever ;
43:14:017:0	the Spirit of truth , whom the world cannot receive , because it does not see Him or know Him , you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you .
43:14:018:0	“ I will not leave you as orphans ; I will come to you .
43:14:019:0	After a little while the world will no longer see Me , but you see Me ; because I live , you will live also .
43:14:020:0	In that day you will know that I am in My Father , and you in Me , and I in you .
43:14:021:0	He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me ; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father , and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him . ”
43:14:022:0	Judas ( not Iscariot ) *said to Him , “ Lord , what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
43:14:023:0	Jesus answered and said to him , “ If anyone loves Me , he will keep My word ; and My Father will love him , and We will come to him and make Our abode with him .
43:14:024:0	He who does not love Me does not keep My words ; and the word which you hear is not Mine , but the Father’s who sent Me .
43:14:025:0	“ These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you .
43:14:026:0	But the Helper , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in My name , He will teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you .
43:14:027:0	Peace I leave with you ; My peace I give to you ; not as the world gives do I give to you . Do not let your heart be troubled , nor let it be fearful .
43:14:028:0	You heard that I said to you , ‘I go away , and I will come to you . ’ If you loved Me , you would have rejoiced because I go to the Father , for the Father is greater than I .
43:14:029:0	Now I have told you before it happens , so that when it happens , you may believe .
43:14:030:0	I will not speak much more with you , for the ruler of the world is coming , and he has nothing in Me ;
43:14:031:0	but so that the world may know that I love the Father , I do exactly as the Father commanded Me . Get up , let us go from here .
