43:17:001:1	The High Priestly Prayer
43:17:001:0	Jesus spoke these things ; and lifting up His eyes to heaven , He said , “ Father , the hour has come ; glorify Your Son , that the Son may glorify You ,
43:17:002:0	even as You gave Him authority over all flesh , that to all whom You have given Him , He may give eternal life .
43:17:003:0	This is eternal life , that they may know You , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom You have sent .
43:17:004:0	I glorified You on the earth , having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do .
43:17:005:0	Now , Father , glorify Me together with Yourself , with the glory which I had with You before the world was .
43:17:006:0	“ I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world ; they were Yours and You gave them to Me , and they have kept Your word .
43:17:007:0	Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You ;
43:17:008:0	for the words which You gave Me I have given to them ; and they received and truly understood that I came forth from You , and they believed that You sent Me .
43:17:009:0	I ask on their behalf ; I do not ask on behalf of the world , but of those whom You have given Me ; for they are Yours ;
43:17:010:0	and all things that are Mine are Yours , and Yours are Mine ; and I have been glorified in them .
43:17:011:0	I am no longer in the world ; and they themselves are in the world , and I come to You . Holy Father , keep them in Your name , which You have given Me , that they may be one even as We
43:17:002:1	The Disciples in the World
43:17:012:0	While I was with them , I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me ; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition , so that the Scripture would be fulfilled .
43:17:013:0	But now I come to You ; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves .
43:17:014:0	I have given them Your word ; and the world has hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43:17:015:0	I do not ask You to take them out of the world , but to keep them from the evil
43:17:016:0	They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43:17:017:0	Sanctify them in the truth ; Your word is truth .
43:17:018:0	As You sent Me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
43:17:019:0	For their sakes I sanctify Myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
43:17:020:0	“ I do not ask on behalf of these alone , but for those also who believe in Me through their word ;
43:17:003:1	Their Future Glory
43:17:021:0	that they may all be one ; even as You , Father , in Me and I in You , that they also may be in Us , so that the world may believe that You sent Me .
43:17:022:0	The glory which You have given Me I have given to them , that they may be one , just as We are one ;
43:17:023:0	I in them and You in Me , that they may be perfected in unity , so that the world may know that You sent Me , and loved them , even as You have loved Me .
43:17:024:0	Father , I desire that they also , whom You have given Me , be with Me where I am , so that they may see My glory which You have given Me , for You loved Me before the foundation of the world .
43:17:025:0	“ O righteous Father , although the world has not known You , yet I have known You ; and these have known that You sent Me ;
43:17:026:0	and I have made Your name known to them , and will make it known , so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them , and I in them . ”
