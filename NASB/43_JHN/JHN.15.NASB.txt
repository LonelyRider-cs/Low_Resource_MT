43:15:001:1	Jesus Is the Vine—Followers Are Branches
43:15:001:0	“ I am the true vine , and My Father is the vinedresser .
43:15:002:0	Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit , He takes away ; and every that bears fruit , He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit .
43:15:003:0	You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you .
43:15:004:0	Abide in Me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine , so neither you unless you abide in Me .
43:15:005:0	I am the vine , you are the branches ; he who abides in Me and I in him , he bears much fruit , for apart from Me you can do nothing .
43:15:006:0	If anyone does not abide in Me , he is thrown away as a branch and dries up ; and they gather them , and cast them into the fire and they are burned .
43:15:007:0	If you abide in Me , and My words abide in you , ask whatever you wish , and it will be done for you .
43:15:008:0	My Father is glorified by this , that you bear much fruit , and prove to be My disciples .
43:15:009:0	Just as the Father has loved Me , I have also loved you ; abide in My love .
43:15:010:0	If you keep My commandments , you will abide in My love ; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love .
43:15:002:1	Disciples’ Relation to Each Other
43:15:011:0	These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you , and your joy may be made full .
43:15:012:0	“ This is My commandment , that you love one another , just as I have loved you .
43:15:013:0	Greater love has no one than this , that one lay down his life for his friends .
43:15:014:0	You are My friends if you do what I command you .
43:15:015:0	No longer do I call you slaves , for the slave does not know what his master is doing ; but I have called you friends , for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you .
43:15:016:0	You did not choose Me but I chose you , and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit , and your fruit would remain , so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you .
43:15:003:1	Disciples’ Relation to the World
43:15:017:0	This I command you , that you love one another .
43:15:018:0	“ If the world hates you , you know that it has hated Me before you .
43:15:019:0	If you were of the world , the world would love its own ; but because you are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , because of this the world hates you .
43:15:020:0	Remember the word that I said to you , ‘A slave is not greater than his master . ’ If they persecuted Me , they will also persecute you ; if they kept My word , they will keep yours also .
43:15:021:0	But all these things they will do to you for My name’s sake , because they do not know the One who sent Me .
43:15:022:0	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43:15:023:0	He who hates Me hates My Father also .
43:15:024:0	If I had not done among them the works which no one else did , they would not have sin ; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well .
43:15:025:0	But to fulfill the word that is written in their Law , ‘T M . ’
43:15:026:0	“ When the Helper comes , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father , He will testify about Me ,
43:15:027:0	and you testify also , because you have been with Me from the beginning .
