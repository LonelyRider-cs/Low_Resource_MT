43:11:001:1	The Death and Resurrection of Lazarus
43:11:001:0	Now a certain man was sick , Lazarus of Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha .
43:11:002:0	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
43:11:003:0	So the sisters sent word to Him , saying , “ Lord , behold , he whom You love is sick . ”
43:11:004:0	But when Jesus heard this , He said , “ This sickness is not to end in death , but for the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified by it . ”
43:11:005:0	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43:11:006:0	So when He heard that he was sick , He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was .
43:11:007:0	Then after this He *said to the disciples , “ Let us go to Judea again . ”
43:11:008:0	The disciples *said to Him , “ Rabbi , the Jews were just now seeking to stone You , and are You going there again ? ”
43:11:009:0	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43:11:010:0	But if anyone walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . ”
43:11:011:0	This He said , and after that He *said to them , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep ; but I go , so that I may awaken him out of sleep . ”
43:11:012:0	The disciples then said to Him , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover . ”
43:11:013:0	Now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep .
43:11:014:0	So Jesus then said to them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead ,
43:11:015:0	and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , so that you may believe ; but let us go to him . ”
43:11:016:0	Therefore Thomas , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us also go , so that we may die with Him . ”
43:11:017:0	So when Jesus came , He found that he had already been in the tomb four days .
43:11:018:0	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles off ;
43:11:019:0	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary , to console them concerning their brother .
43:11:020:0	Martha therefore , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went to meet Him , but Mary stayed at the house .
43:11:021:0	Martha then said to Jesus , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
43:11:022:0	Even now I know that whatever You ask of God , God will give You . ”
43:11:023:0	Jesus *said to her , “ Your brother will rise again . ”
43:11:024:0	Martha *said to Him , “ I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day . ”
43:11:025:0	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life ; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies ,
43:11:026:0	and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
43:11:027:0	She *said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; I have believed that You are the Christ , the Son of God , even He who comes into the world . ”
43:11:028:0	When she had said this , she went away and called Mary her sister , saying secretly , “ The Teacher is here and is calling for you . ”
43:11:029:0	And when she heard it , she *got up quickly and was coming to Him .
43:11:030:0	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha met Him .
43:11:031:0	Then the Jews who were with her in the house , and consoling her , when they saw that Mary got up quickly and went out , they followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
43:11:032:0	Therefore , when Mary came where Jesus was , she saw Him , and fell at His feet , saying to Him , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43:11:033:0	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her also weeping , He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled ,
43:11:034:0	and said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They *said to Him , “ Lord , come and see . ”
43:11:035:0	Jesus wept .
43:11:036:0	So the Jews were saying , “ See how He loved him ! ”
43:11:037:0	But some of them said , “ Could not this man , who opened the eyes of the blind man , have kept this man also from dying ? ”
43:11:038:0	So Jesus , again being deeply moved within , *came to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone was lying against it .
43:11:039:0	Jesus *said , “ Remove the stone . ” Martha , the sister of the deceased , *said to Him , “ Lord , by this time there will be a stench , for he has been dead four days . ”
43:11:040:0	Jesus *said to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? ”
43:11:041:0	So they removed the stone . Then Jesus raised His eyes , and said , “ Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
43:11:042:0	I knew that You always hear Me ; but because of the people standing around I said it , so that they may believe that You sent Me . ”
43:11:043:0	When He had said these things , He cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come forth . ”
43:11:044:0	The man who had died came forth , bound hand and foot with wrappings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus *said to them , “ Unbind him , and let him go . ”
43:11:045:0	Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary , and saw what He had done , believed in Him .
43:11:002:1	Conspiracy to Kill Jesus
43:11:046:0	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done .
43:11:047:0	Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council , and were saying , “ What are we doing ? For this man is performing many signs .
43:11:048:0	If we let Him go on like this , all men will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . ”
43:11:049:0	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , said to them , “ You know nothing at all ,
43:11:050:0	nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . ”
43:11:051:0	Now he did not say this on his own initiative , but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ,
43:11:052:0	and not for the nation only , but in order that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad .
43:11:053:0	So from that day on they planned together to kill Him .
43:11:054:0	Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews , but went away from there to the country near the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim ; and there He stayed with the disciples .
43:11:055:0	Now the Passover of the Jews was near , and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover to purify themselves .
43:11:056:0	So they were seeking for Jesus , and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple , “ What do you think ; that He will not come to the feast at all ? ”
43:11:057:0	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he was to report it , so that they might seize Him .
