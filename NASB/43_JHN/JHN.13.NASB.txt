43:13:001:1	The Lord’s Supper
43:13:001:0	Now before the Feast of the Passover , Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He would depart out of this world to the Father , having loved His own who were in the world , He loved them to the end .
43:13:002:0	During supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray Him ,
43:13:003:0	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands , and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God ,
43:13:002:1	Jesus Washes the Disciples’ Feet
43:13:004:0	*got up from supper , and *laid aside His garments ; and taking a towel , He girded Himself .
43:13:005:0	Then He *poured water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded .
43:13:006:0	So He *came to Simon Peter . He *said to Him , “ Lord , do You wash my feet ? ”
43:13:007:0	Jesus answered and said to him , “ What I do you do not realize now , but you will understand hereafter . ”
43:13:008:0	Peter *said to Him , “ Never shall You wash my feet ! ” Jesus answered him , “ If I do not wash you , you have no part with Me . ”
43:13:009:0	Simon Peter *said to Him , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but also my hands and my head . ”
43:13:010:0	Jesus *said to him , “ He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is completely clean ; and you are clean , but not all ”
43:13:011:0	For He knew the one who was betraying Him ; for this reason He said , “ Not all of you are clean . ”
43:13:012:0	So when He had washed their feet , and taken His garments and reclined at the table again , He said to them , “ Do you know what I have done to you ?
43:13:013:0	You call Me Teacher and Lord ; and you are right , for I am .
43:13:014:0	If I then , the Lord and the Teacher , washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another’s feet .
43:13:015:0	For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you .
43:13:016:0	Truly , truly , I say to you , a slave is not greater than his master , nor one who is sent greater than the one who sent him .
43:13:017:0	If you know these things , you are blessed if you do them .
43:13:018:0	I do not speak of all of you . I know the ones I have chosen ; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ‘H M M . ’
43:13:019:0	From now on I am telling you before comes to pass , so that when it does occur , you may believe that I am
43:13:003:1	Jesus Predicts His Betrayal
43:13:020:0	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who receives whomever I send receives Me ; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me . ”
43:13:021:0	When Jesus had said this , He became troubled in spirit , and testified and said , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , that one of you will betray Me . ”
43:13:022:0	The disciples began looking at one another , at a loss to know of which one He was speaking .
43:13:023:0	There was reclining on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples , whom Jesus loved .
43:13:024:0	So Simon Peter *gestured to him , and *said to him , “ Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking . ”
43:13:025:0	He , leaning back thus on Jesus’ bosom , *said to Him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
43:13:026:0	Jesus then *answered , “ That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him . ” So when He had dipped the morsel , He *took and *gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43:13:027:0	After the morsel , Satan then entered into him . Therefore Jesus *said to him , “ What you do , do quickly . ”
43:13:028:0	Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him .
43:13:029:0	For some were supposing , because Judas had the money box , that Jesus was saying to him , “ Buy the things we have need of for the feast ” ; or else , that he should give something to the poor .
43:13:030:0	So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately ; and it was night .
43:13:031:0	Therefore when he had gone out , Jesus *said , “ Now is the Son of Man glorified , and God is glorified in Him ;
43:13:032:0	if God is glorified in Him , God will also glorify Him in Himself , and will glorify Him immediately .
43:13:033:0	Little children , I am with you a little while longer . You will seek Me ; and as I said to the Jews , now I also say to you , ‘Where I am going , you cannot come . ’
43:13:034:0	A new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , even as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
43:13:035:0	By this all men will know that you are My disciples , if you have love for one another . ”
43:13:036:0	Simon Peter *said to Him , “ Lord , where are You going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I go , you cannot follow Me now ; but you will follow later . ”
43:13:037:0	Peter *said to Him , “ Lord , why can I not follow You right now ? I will lay down my life for You . ”
43:13:038:0	Jesus *answered , “ Will you lay down your life for Me ? Truly , truly , I say to you , a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times .
