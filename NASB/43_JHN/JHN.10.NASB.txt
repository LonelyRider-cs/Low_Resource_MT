43:10:001:1	Parable of the Good Shepherd
43:10:001:0	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep , but climbs up some other way , he is a thief and a robber .
43:10:002:0	But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep .
43:10:003:0	To him the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep hear his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43:10:004:0	When he puts forth all his own , he goes ahead of them , and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
43:10:005:0	A stranger they simply will not follow , but will flee from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers . ”
43:10:006:0	This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them , but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them .
43:10:007:0	So Jesus said to them again , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
43:10:008:0	All who came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them .
43:10:009:0	I am the door ; if anyone enters through Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture .
43:10:010:0	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy ; I came that they may have life , and have abundantly .
43:10:011:0	“ I am the good shepherd ; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep .
43:10:012:0	He who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who is not the owner of the sheep , sees the wolf coming , and leaves the sheep and flees , and the wolf snatches them and scatters
43:10:013:0	because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep .
43:10:014:0	I am the good shepherd , and I know My own and My own know Me ,
43:10:015:0	even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father ; and I lay down My life for the sheep .
43:10:016:0	I have other sheep , which are not of this fold ; I must bring them also , and they will hear My voice ; and they will become one flock one shepherd .
43:10:017:0	For this reason the Father loves Me , because I lay down My life so that I may take it again .
43:10:018:0	No one has taken it away from Me , but I lay it down on My own initiative . I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to take it up again . This commandment I received from My Father . ”
43:10:019:0	A division occurred again among the Jews because of these words .
43:10:020:0	Many of them were saying , “ He has a demon and is insane . Why do you listen to Him ? ”
43:10:002:1	Jesus Asserts His Deity
43:10:021:0	Others were saying , “ These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed . A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind , can he ? ”
43:10:022:0	At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem ;
43:10:023:0	it was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon .
43:10:024:0	The Jews then gathered around Him , and were saying to Him , “ How long will You keep us in suspense ? If You are the Christ , tell us plainly . ”
43:10:025:0	Jesus answered them , “ I told you , and you do not believe ; the works that I do in My Father’s name , these testify of Me .
43:10:026:0	But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep .
43:10:027:0	My sheep hear My voice , and I know them , and they follow Me ;
43:10:028:0	and I give eternal life to them , and they will never perish ; and no one will snatch them out of My hand .
43:10:029:0	My Father , who has given to Me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch out of the Father’s hand .
43:10:030:0	I and the Father are one . ”
43:10:031:0	The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him .
43:10:032:0	Jesus answered them , “ I showed you many good works from the Father ; for which of them are you stoning Me ? ”
43:10:033:0	The Jews answered Him , “ For a good work we do not stone You , but for blasphemy ; and because You , being a man , make Yourself out to be God . ”
43:10:034:0	Jesus answered them , “ Has it not been written in your Law , ‘I , ’ ?
43:10:035:0	If he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture cannot be broken ) ,
43:10:036:0	do you say of Him , whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ‘You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘I am the Son of God’ ?
43:10:037:0	If I do not do the works of My Father , do not believe Me ;
43:10:038:0	but if I do them , though you do not believe Me , believe the works , so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me , and I in the Father . ”
43:10:039:0	Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him , and He eluded their grasp .
43:10:040:0	And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing , and He was staying there .
43:10:041:0	Many came to Him and were saying , “ While John performed no sign , yet everything John said about this man was true . ”
43:10:042:0	Many believed in Him there .
