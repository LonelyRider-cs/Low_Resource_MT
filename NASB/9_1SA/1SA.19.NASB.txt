9:19:001:1	David Protected from Saul
9:19:001:0	Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death . But Jonathan , Saul’s son , greatly delighted in David .
9:19:002:0	So Jonathan told David saying , “ Saul my father is seeking to put you to death . Now therefore , please be on guard in the morning , and stay in a secret place and hide yourself .
9:19:003:0	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will speak with my father about you ; if I find out anything , then I will tell you . ”
9:19:004:0	Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him , “ Do not let the king sin against his servant David , since he has not sinned against you , and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you .
9:19:005:0	For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine , and the Lord brought about a great deliverance for all Israel ; you saw it and rejoiced . Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without a cause ? ”
9:19:006:0	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan , and Saul vowed , “ As the Lord lives , he shall not be put to death . ”
9:19:007:0	Then Jonathan called David , and Jonathan told him all these words . And Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence as formerly .
9:19:008:0	When there was war again , David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated them with great slaughter , so that they fled before him .
9:19:009:0	Now there was an evil spirit from the Lord on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand , and David was playing the harp with his hand .
9:19:010:0	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear , but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence , so that he stuck the spear into the wall . And David fled and escaped that night .
9:19:011:0	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him , in order to put him to death in the morning . But Michal , David’s wife , told him , saying , “ If you do not save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be put to death . ”
9:19:012:0	So Michal let David down through a window , and he went out and fled and escaped .
9:19:013:0	Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed , and put a quilt of goats’ hair at its head , and covered it with clothes .
9:19:014:0	When Saul sent messengers to take David , she said , “ He is sick . ”
9:19:015:0	Then Saul sent messengers to see David , saying , “ Bring him up to me on his bed , that I may put him to death . ”
9:19:016:0	When the messengers entered , behold , the household idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair at its head .
9:19:017:0	So Saul said to Michal , “ Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go , so that he has escaped ? ” And Michal said to Saul , “ He said to me , ‘Let me go ! Why should I put you to death ? ’ ”
9:19:018:0	Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth .
9:19:019:0	It was told Saul , saying , “ Behold , David is at Naioth in Ramah . ”
9:19:020:0	Then Saul sent messengers to take David , but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying , with Samuel standing and presiding over them , the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul ; and they also prophesied .
9:19:021:0	When it was told Saul , he sent other messengers , and they also prophesied . So Saul sent messengers again the third time , and they also prophesied .
9:19:022:0	Then he himself went to Ramah and came as far as the large well that is in Secu ; and he asked and said , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” And someone said , “ Behold , they are at Naioth in Ramah . ”
9:19:023:0	He proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah ; and the Spirit of God came upon him also , so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
9:19:024:0	He also stripped off his clothes , and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night . Therefore they say , “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
