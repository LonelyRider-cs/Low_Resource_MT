9:13:001:1	War with the Philistines
9:13:001:0	Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty two years over Israel .
9:13:002:0	Now Saul chose for himself 3 , 000 men of Israel , of which 2 , 000 were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel , while 1 , 000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin . But he sent away the rest of the people , each to his tent .
9:13:003:0	Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it . Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land , saying , “ Let the Hebrews hear . ”
9:13:004:0	All Israel heard the news that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines , and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines . The people were then summoned to Saul at Gilgal .
9:13:005:0	Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel , 30 , 000 chariots and 6 , 000 horsemen , and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance ; and they came up and camped in Michmash , east of Beth-aven .
9:13:006:0	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were hard-pressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , in thickets , in cliffs , in cellars , and in pits .
9:13:007:0	Also some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead . But as for Saul , he was still in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
9:13:008:0	Now he waited seven days , according to the appointed time set by Samuel , but Samuel did not come to Gilgal ; and the people were scattering from him .
9:13:009:0	So Saul said , “ Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings . ” And he offered the burnt offering .
9:13:010:0	As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him and to greet him .
9:13:011:0	But Samuel said , “ What have you done ? ” And Saul said , “ Because I saw that the people were scattering from me , and that you did not come within the appointed days , and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash ,
9:13:012:0	therefore I said , ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal , and I have not asked the favor of the Lord . ’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering . ”
9:13:013:0	Samuel said to Saul , “ You have acted foolishly ; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God , which He commanded you , for now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever .
9:13:014:0	But now your kingdom shall not endure . The Lord has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart , and the Lord has appointed him as ruler over His people , because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you . ”
9:13:015:0	Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin . And Saul numbered the people who were present with him , about six hundred men .
9:13:016:0	Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash .
9:13:017:0	And the raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned toward Ophrah , to the land of Shual ,
9:13:018:0	and another company turned toward Beth-horon , and another company turned toward the border which overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness .
9:13:019:0	Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel , for the Philistines said , “ Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears . ”
9:13:020:0	So all Israel went down to the Philistines , each to sharpen his plowshare , his mattock , his axe , and his hoe .
9:13:021:0	The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares , the mattocks , the forks , and the axes , and to fix the hoes .
9:13:022:0	So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan , but they were found with Saul and his son Jonathan .
9:13:023:0	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash .
