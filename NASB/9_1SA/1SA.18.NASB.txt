9:18:001:1	Jonathan and David
9:18:001:0	Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as himself .
9:18:002:0	Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father’s house .
9:18:003:0	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself .
9:18:004:0	Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David , with his armor , including his sword and his bow and his belt .
9:18:005:0	So David went out wherever Saul sent him , and prospered ; and Saul set him over the men of war . And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants .
9:18:006:0	It happened as they were coming , when David returned from killing the Philistine , that the women came out of all the cities of Israel , singing and dancing , to meet King Saul , with tambourines , with joy and with musical instruments .
9:18:007:0	The women sang as they played , and said , “ Saul has slain his thousands , And David his ten thousands . ”
9:18:008:0	Then Saul became very angry , for this saying displeased him ; and he said , “ They have ascribed to David ten thousands , but to me they have ascribed thousands . Now what more can he have but the kingdom ? ”
9:18:002:1	Saul Turns against David
9:18:009:0	Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on .
9:18:010:0	Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul , and he raved in the midst of the house , while David was playing the harp with his hand , as usual ; and a spear was in Saul’s hand .
9:18:011:0	Saul hurled the spear for he thought , “ I will pin David to the wall . ” But David escaped from his presence twice .
9:18:012:0	Now Saul was afraid of David , for the Lord was with him but had departed from Saul .
9:18:013:0	Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
9:18:014:0	David was prospering in all his ways for the Lord was with him .
9:18:015:0	When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly , he dreaded him .
9:18:016:0	But all Israel and Judah loved David , and he went out and came in before them .
9:18:017:0	Then Saul said to David , “ Here is my older daughter Merab ; I will give her to you as a wife , only be a valiant man for me and fight the Lord’s battles . ” For Saul thought , “ My hand shall not be against him , but let the hand of the Philistines be against him . ”
9:18:018:0	But David said to Saul , “ Who am I , and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel , that I should be the king’s son-in-law ? ”
9:18:003:1	David Marries Saul’s Daughter
9:18:019:0	So it came about at the time when Merab , Saul’s daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife .
9:18:020:0	Now Michal , Saul’s daughter , loved David . When they told Saul , the thing was agreeable to him .
9:18:021:0	Saul thought , “ I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him , and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him . ” Therefore Saul said to David , “ For a second time you may be my son-in-law today . ”
9:18:022:0	Then Saul commanded his servants , “ Speak to David secretly , saying , ‘Behold , the king delights in you , and all his servants love you ; now therefore , become the king’s son-in-law . ’ ”
9:18:023:0	So Saul’s servants spoke these words to David . But David said , “ Is it trivial in your sight to become the king’s son-in-law , since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed ? ”
9:18:024:0	The servants of Saul reported to him according to these words which David spoke .
9:18:025:0	Saul then said , “ Thus you shall say to David , ‘The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to take vengeance on the king’s enemies . ’ ” Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
9:18:026:0	When his servants told David these words , it pleased David to become the king’s son-in-law . Before the days had expired
9:18:027:0	David rose up and went , he and his men , and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines . Then David brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full number to the king , that he might become the king’s son-in-law . So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife .
9:18:028:0	When Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David , and that Michal , Saul’s daughter , loved him ,
9:18:029:0	then Saul was even more afraid of David . Thus Saul was David’s enemy continually .
9:18:030:0	Then the commanders of the Philistines went out to battle , and it happened as often as they went out , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul . So his name was highly esteemed .
