9:12:001:1	Samuel Addresses Israel
9:12:001:0	Then Samuel said to all Israel , “ Behold , I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me and I have appointed a king over you .
9:12:002:0	Now , here is the king walking before you , but I am old and gray , and behold my sons are with you . And I have walked before you from my youth even to this day .
9:12:003:0	Here I am ; bear witness against me before the Lord and His anointed . Whose ox have I taken , or whose donkey have I taken , or whom have I defrauded ? Whom have I oppressed , or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it ? I will restore it to you . ”
9:12:004:0	They said , “ You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man’s hand . ”
9:12:005:0	He said to them , “ The Lord is witness against you , and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing in my hand . ” And they said , “ He is witness . ”
9:12:006:0	Then Samuel said to the people , “ It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt .
9:12:007:0	So now , take your stand , that I may plead with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord which He did for you and your fathers .
9:12:008:0	When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place .
9:12:009:0	But they forgot the Lord their God , so He sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the army of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
9:12:010:0	They cried out to the Lord and said , ‘We have sinned because we have forsaken the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth ; but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies , and we will serve You . ’
9:12:002:1	The King Confirmed
9:12:011:0	Then the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel , and delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around , so that you lived in security .
9:12:012:0	When you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you , you said to me , ‘No , but a king shall reign over us , ’ although the Lord your God was your king .
9:12:013:0	Now therefore , here is the king whom you have chosen , whom you have asked for , and behold , the Lord has set a king over you .
9:12:014:0	If you will fear the Lord and serve Him , and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the Lord , then both you and also the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God .
9:12:015:0	If you will not listen to the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the command of the Lord , then the hand of the Lord will be against you , as it was against your fathers .
9:12:016:0	Even now , take your stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes .
9:12:017:0	Is it not the wheat harvest today ? I will call to the Lord , that He may send thunder and rain . Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the Lord by asking for yourselves a king . ”
9:12:018:0	So Samuel called to the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day ; and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
9:12:019:0	Then all the people said to Samuel , “ Pray for your servants to the Lord your God , so that we may not die , for we have added to all our sins this evil by asking for ourselves a king . ”
9:12:020:0	Samuel said to the people , “ Do not fear . You have committed all this evil , yet do not turn aside from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart .
9:12:021:0	You must not turn aside , for then you would go after futile things which can not profit or deliver , because they are futile .
9:12:022:0	For the Lord will not abandon His people on account of His great name , because the Lord has been pleased to make you a people for Himself .
9:12:023:0	Moreover , as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you ; but I will instruct you in the good and right way .
9:12:024:0	Only fear the Lord and serve Him in truth with all your heart ; for consider what great things He has done for you .
9:12:025:0	But if you still do wickedly , both you and your king will be swept away . ”
