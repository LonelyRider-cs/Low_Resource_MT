9:23:001:1	David Delivers Keilah
9:23:001:0	Then they told David , saying , “ Behold , the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors . ”
9:23:002:0	So David inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I go and attack these Philistines ? ” And the Lord said to David , “ Go and attack the Philistines and deliver Keilah . ”
9:23:003:0	But David’s men said to him , “ Behold , we are afraid here in Judah . How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines ? ”
9:23:004:0	Then David inquired of the Lord once more . And the Lord answered him and said , “ Arise , go down to Keilah , for I will give the Philistines into your hand . ”
9:23:005:0	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines ; and he led away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter . Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah .
9:23:006:0	Now it came about , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
9:23:007:0	When it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah , Saul said , “ God has delivered him into my hand , for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars . ”
9:23:008:0	So Saul summoned all the people for war , to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men .
9:23:009:0	Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him ; so he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring the ephod here . ”
9:23:010:0	Then David said , “ O Lord God of Israel , Your servant has heard for certain that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account .
9:23:011:0	Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand ? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard ? O Lord God of Israel , I pray , tell Your servant . ” And the Lord said , “ He will come down . ”
9:23:012:0	Then David said , “ Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul ? ” And the Lord said , “ They will surrender you . ”
9:23:013:0	Then David and his men , about six hundred , arose and departed from Keilah , and they went wherever they could go . When it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah , he gave up the pursuit .
9:23:002:1	Saul Pursues David
9:23:014:0	David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph . And Saul sought him every day , but God did not deliver him into his hand .
9:23:015:0	Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh .
9:23:016:0	And Jonathan , Saul’s son , arose and went to David at Horesh , and encouraged him in God .
9:23:017:0	Thus he said to him , “ Do not be afraid , because the hand of Saul my father will not find you , and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you ; and Saul my father knows that also . ”
9:23:018:0	So the two of them made a covenant before the Lord ; and David stayed at Horesh while Jonathan went to his house .
9:23:019:0	Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah , saying , “ Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds at Horesh , on the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
9:23:020:0	Now then , O king , come down according to all the desire of your soul to do so ; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king’s hand . ”
9:23:021:0	Saul said , “ May you be blessed of the Lord , for you have had compassion on me .
9:23:022:0	Go now , make more sure , and investigate and see his place where his haunt is , and who has seen him there ; for I am told that he is very cunning .
9:23:023:0	So look , and learn about all the hiding places where he hides himself and return to me with certainty , and I will go with you ; and if he is in the land , I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah . ”
9:23:024:0	Then they arose and went to Ziph before Saul . Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon .
9:23:025:0	When Saul and his men went to seek him , they told David , and he came down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon . And when Saul heard it , he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon .
9:23:026:0	Saul went on one side of the mountain , and David and his men on the other side of the mountain ; and David was hurrying to get away from Saul , for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to seize them .
9:23:027:0	But a messenger came to Saul , saying , “ Hurry and come , for the Philistines have made a raid on the land . ”
9:23:028:0	So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines ; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape .
9:23:029:0	David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi .
