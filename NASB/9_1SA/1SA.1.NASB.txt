9:1:001:1	Elkanah and His Wives
9:1:001:0	Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephraimite .
9:1:002:0	He had two wives : the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah ; and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
9:1:003:0	Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shiloh . And the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were priests to the Lord there .
9:1:004:0	When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed , he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters ;
9:1:005:0	but to Hannah he would give a double portion , for he loved Hannah , but the Lord had closed her womb .
9:1:006:0	Her rival , however , would provoke her bitterly to irritate her , because the Lord had closed her womb .
9:1:007:0	It happened year after year , as often as she went up to the house of the Lord , she would provoke her ; so she wept and would not eat .
9:1:008:0	Then Elkanah her husband said to her , “ Hannah , why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart sad ? Am I not better to you than ten sons ? ”
9:1:009:0	Then Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh . Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord .
9:1:010:0	She , greatly distressed , prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly .
9:1:011:0	She made a vow and said , “ O Lord of hosts , if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me , and not forget Your maidservant , but will give Your maidservant a son , then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life , and a razor shall never come on his head . ”
9:1:012:0	Now it came about , as she continued praying before the Lord , that Eli was watching her mouth .
9:1:013:0	As for Hannah , she was speaking in her heart , only her lips were moving , but her voice was not heard . So Eli thought she was drunk .
9:1:014:0	Then Eli said to her , “ How long will you make yourself drunk ? Put away your wine from you . ”
9:1:015:0	But Hannah replied , “ No , my lord , I am a woman oppressed in spirit ; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but I have poured out my soul before the Lord .
9:1:016:0	Do not consider your maidservant as a worthless woman , for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation . ”
9:1:017:0	Then Eli answered and said , “ Go in peace ; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him . ”
9:1:002:1	Samuel Is Born to Hannah
9:1:018:0	She said , “ Let your maidservant find favor in your sight . ” So the woman went her way and ate , and her face was no longer sad .
9:1:019:0	Then they arose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord , and returned again to their house in Ramah . And Elkanah had relations with Hannah his wife , and the Lord remembered her .
9:1:020:0	It came about in due time , after Hannah had conceived , that she gave birth to a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , “ Because I have asked him of the Lord . ”
9:1:021:0	Then the man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow .
9:1:022:0	But Hannah did not go up , for she said to her husband , “ I will not go up until the child is weaned ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before the Lord and stay there forever . ”
9:1:023:0	Elkanah her husband said to her , “ Do what seems best to you . Remain until you have weaned him ; only may the Lord confirm His word . ” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him .
9:1:024:0	Now when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with a three-year-old bull and one ephah of flour and a jug of wine , and brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh , although the child was young .
9:1:025:0	Then they slaughtered the bull , and brought the boy to Eli .
9:1:026:0	She said , “ Oh , my lord ! As your soul lives , my lord , I am the woman who stood here beside you , praying to the Lord .
9:1:027:0	For this boy I prayed , and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him .
9:1:028:0	So I have also dedicated him to the Lord ; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord . ” And he worshiped the Lord there .
