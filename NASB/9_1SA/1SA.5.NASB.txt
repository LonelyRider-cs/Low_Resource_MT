9:5:001:1	Capture of the Ark Provokes God
9:5:001:0	Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod .
9:5:002:0	Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon .
9:5:003:0	When the Ashdodites arose early the next morning , behold , Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord . So they took Dagon and set him in his place again .
9:5:004:0	But when they arose early the next morning , behold , Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord . And the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold ; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him .
9:5:005:0	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor all who enter Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day .
9:5:006:0	Now the hand of the Lord was heavy on the Ashdodites , and He ravaged them and smote them with tumors , both Ashdod and its territories .
9:5:007:0	When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , “ The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us , for His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god . ”
9:5:008:0	So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said , “ What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ? ” And they said , “ Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath . ” And they brought the ark of the God of Israel around .
9:5:009:0	After they had brought it around , the hand of the Lord was against the city with very great confusion ; and He smote the men of the city , both young and old , so that tumors broke out on them .
9:5:010:0	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron . And as the ark of God came to Ekron the Ekronites cried out , saying , “ They have brought the ark of the God of Israel around to us , to kill us and our people . ”
9:5:011:0	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said , “ Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it return to its own place , so that it will not kill us and our people . ” For there was a deadly confusion throughout the city ; the hand of God was very heavy there .
9:5:012:0	And the men who did not die were smitten with tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
