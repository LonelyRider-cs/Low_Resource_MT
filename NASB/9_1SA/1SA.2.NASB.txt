9:2:001:1	Hannah’s Song of Thanksgiving
9:2:001:0	Then Hannah prayed and said , “ My heart exults in the Lord ; My horn is exalted in the Lord , My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies , Because I rejoice in Your salvation .
9:2:002:0	There is no one holy like the Lord , Indeed , there is no one besides You , Nor is there any rock like our God .
9:2:003:0	Boast no more so very proudly , Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth ; For the Lord is a God of knowledge , And with Him actions are weighed .
9:2:004:0	The bows of the mighty are shattered , But the feeble gird on strength .
9:2:005:0	Those who were full hire themselves out for bread , But those who were hungry cease to hunger . Even the barren gives birth to seven , But she who has many children languishes .
9:2:006:0	The Lord kills and makes alive ; He brings down to Sheol and raises up .
9:2:007:0	The Lord makes poor and rich ; He brings low , He also exalts .
9:2:008:0	He raises the poor from the dust , He lifts the needy from the ash heapTo make them sit with nobles , And inherit a seat of honor ; For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s , And He set the world on them .
9:2:009:0	He keeps the feet of His godly ones , But the wicked ones are silenced in darkness ; For not by might shall a man prevail .
9:2:010:0	Those who contend with the Lord will be shattered ; Against them He will thunder in the heavens , The Lord will judge the ends of the earth ; And He will give strength to His king , And will exalt the horn of His anointed . ”
9:2:002:1	The Sin of Eli’s Sons
9:2:011:0	Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah . But the boy ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest .
9:2:012:0	Now the sons of Eli were worthless men ; they did not know the Lord
9:2:013:0	and the custom of the priests with the people . When any man was offering a sacrifice , the priest’s servant would come while the meat was boiling , with a three-pronged fork in his hand .
9:2:014:0	Then he would thrust it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself . Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there .
9:2:015:0	Also , before they burned the fat , the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing , “ Give the priest meat for roasting , as he will not take boiled meat from you , only raw . ”
9:2:016:0	If the man said to him , “ They must surely burn the fat first , and then take as much as you desire , ” then he would say , “ No , but you shall give it to me now ; and if not , I will take it by force . ”
9:2:003:1	Samuel before the L
9:2:004:1	ord
9:2:005:1	as a Boy
9:2:017:0	Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord , for the men despised the offering of the Lord .
9:2:018:0	Now Samuel was ministering before the Lord , as a boy wearing a linen ephod .
9:2:019:0	And his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
9:2:020:0	Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say , “ May the Lord give you children from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the Lord . ” And they went to their own home .
9:2:006:1	Eli Rebukes His Sons
9:2:021:0	The Lord visited Hannah ; and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters . And the boy Samuel grew before the Lord .
9:2:022:0	Now Eli was very old ; and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel , and how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting .
9:2:023:0	He said to them , “ Why do you do such things , the evil things that I hear from all these people ?
9:2:024:0	No , my sons ; for the report is not good which I hear the Lord’s people circulating .
9:2:025:0	If one man sins against another , God will mediate for him ; but if a man sins against the Lord , who can intercede for him ? ” But they would not listen to the voice of their father , for the Lord desired to put them to death .
9:2:026:0	Now the boy Samuel was growing in stature and in favor both with the Lord and with men .
9:2:027:0	Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘Did I not indeed reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house ?
9:2:028:0	Did I not choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My priests , to go up to My altar , to burn incense , to carry an ephod before Me ; and did I not give to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel ?
9:2:029:0	Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling , and honor your sons above Me , by making yourselves fat with the choicest of every offering of My people Israel ? ’
9:2:030:0	Therefore the Lord God of Israel declares , ‘I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father should walk before Me forever’ ; but now the Lord declares , ‘Far be it from Me—for those who honor Me I will honor , and those who despise Me will be lightly esteemed .
9:2:031:0	Behold , the days are coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father’s house so that there will not be an old man in your house .
9:2:032:0	You will see the distress of My dwelling , in spite of all the good that I do for Israel ; and an old man will not be in your house forever .
9:2:033:0	Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar so that your eyes will fail from weeping and your soul grieve , and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life .
9:2:034:0	This will be the sign to you which will come concerning your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas : on the same day both of them will die .
9:2:035:0	But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and in My soul ; and I will build him an enduring house , and he will walk before My anointed always .
9:2:036:0	Everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and say , “ Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so that I may eat a piece of bread . ” ’ ”
