9:15:001:1	Saul’s Disobedience
9:15:001:0	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ The Lord sent me to anoint you as king over His people , over Israel ; now therefore , listen to the words of the Lord .
9:15:002:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel , how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt .
9:15:003:0	Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has , and do not spare him ; but put to death both man and woman , child and infant , ox and sheep , camel and donkey . ’ ”
9:15:004:0	Then Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim , 200 , 000 foot soldiers and 10 , 000 men of Judah .
9:15:005:0	Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley .
9:15:006:0	Saul said to the Kenites , “ Go , depart , go down from among the Amalekites , so that I do not destroy you with them ; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt . ” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
9:15:007:0	So Saul defeated the Amalekites , from Havilah as you go to Shur , which is east of Egypt .
9:15:008:0	He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
9:15:002:1	Samuel Rebukes Saul
9:15:009:0	But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep , the oxen , the fatlings , the lambs , and all that was good , and were not willing to destroy them utterly ; but everything despised and worthless , that they utterly destroyed .
9:15:010:0	Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel , saying ,
9:15:011:0	“ I regret that I have made Saul king , for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands . ” And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the Lord all night .
9:15:012:0	Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul ; and it was told Samuel , saying , “ Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set up a monument for himself , then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal . ”
9:15:013:0	Samuel came to Saul , and Saul said to him , “ Blessed are you of the Lord ! I have carried out the command of the Lord . ”
9:15:014:0	But Samuel said , “ What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears , and the lowing of the oxen which I hear ? ”
9:15:015:0	Saul said , “ They have brought them from the Amalekites , for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen , to sacrifice to the Lord your God ; but the rest we have utterly destroyed . ”
9:15:016:0	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ Wait , and let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night . ” And he said to him , “ Speak ! ”
9:15:017:0	Samuel said , “ Is it not true , though you were little in your own eyes , you were made the head of the tribes of Israel ? And the Lord anointed you king over Israel ,
9:15:018:0	and the Lord sent you on a mission , and said , ‘Go and utterly destroy the sinners , the Amalekites , and fight against them until they are exterminated . ’
9:15:019:0	Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord , but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the sight of the Lord ? ”
9:15:020:0	Then Saul said to Samuel , “ I did obey the voice of the Lord , and went on the mission on which the Lord sent me , and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
9:15:021:0	But the people took some of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the choicest of the things devoted to destruction , to sacrifice to the Lord your God at Gilgal . ”
9:15:022:0	Samuel said , “ Has the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrificesAs in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , And to heed than the fat of rams .
9:15:023:0	For rebellion is as the sin of divination , And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry . Because you have rejected the word of the Lord , He has also rejected you from being king . ”
9:15:024:0	Then Saul said to Samuel , “ I have sinned ; I have indeed transgressed the command of the Lord and your words , because I feared the people and listened to their voice .
9:15:025:0	Now therefore , please pardon my sin and return with me , that I may worship the Lord . ”
9:15:026:0	But Samuel said to Saul , “ I will not return with you ; for you have rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel . ”
9:15:027:0	As Samuel turned to go , Saul seized the edge of his robe , and it tore .
9:15:028:0	So Samuel said to him , “ The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor , who is better than you .
9:15:029:0	Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind ; for He is not a man that He should change His mind . ”
9:15:030:0	Then he said , “ I have sinned ; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel , and go back with me , that I may worship the Lord your God . ”
9:15:031:0	So Samuel went back following Saul , and Saul worshiped the Lord .
9:15:032:0	Then Samuel said , “ Bring me Agag , the king of the Amalekites . ” And Agag came to him cheerfully . And Agag said , “ Surely the bitterness of death is past . ”
9:15:033:0	But Samuel said , “ As your sword has made women childless , so shall your mother be childless among women . ” And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the Lord at Gilgal .
9:15:034:0	Then Samuel went to Ramah , but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul .
9:15:035:0	Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death ; for Samuel grieved over Saul . And the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel .
