9:26:001:1	David Again Spares Saul
9:26:001:0	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah , saying , “ Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon ? ”
9:26:002:0	So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel , to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph .
9:26:003:0	Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , beside the road , and David was staying in the wilderness . When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness ,
9:26:004:0	David sent out spies , and he knew that Saul was definitely coming .
9:26:005:0	David then arose and came to the place where Saul had camped . And David saw the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the commander of his army ; and Saul was lying in the circle of the camp , and the people were camped around him .
9:26:006:0	Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , Joab’s brother , saying , “ Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp ? ” And Abishai said , “ I will go down with you . ”
9:26:007:0	So David and Abishai came to the people by night , and behold , Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people were lying around him .
9:26:008:0	Then Abishai said to David , “ Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand ; now therefore , please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke , and I will not strike him the second time . ”
9:26:009:0	But David said to Abishai , “ Do not destroy him , for who can stretch out his hand against the Lord’s anointed and be without guilt ? ”
9:26:010:0	David also said , “ As the Lord lives , surely the Lord will strike him , or his day will come that he dies , or he will go down into battle and perish .
9:26:011:0	The Lord forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the Lord’s anointed ; but now please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water , and let us go . ”
9:26:012:0	So David took the spear and the jug of water from beside Saul’s head , and they went away , but no one saw or knew it , nor did any awake , for they were all asleep , because a sound sleep from the Lord had fallen on them .
9:26:013:0	Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance with a large area between them .
9:26:014:0	David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , “ Will you not answer , Abner ? ” Then Abner replied , “ Who are you who calls to the king ? ”
9:26:015:0	So David said to Abner , “ Are you not a man ? And who is like you in Israel ? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king ? For one of the people came to destroy the king your lord .
9:26:016:0	This thing that you have done is not good . As the Lord lives , all of you must surely die , because you did not guard your lord , the Lord’s anointed . And now , see where the king’s spear is and the jug of water that was at his head . ”
9:26:017:0	Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said , “ Is this your voice , my son David ? ” And David said , “ It is my voice , my lord the king . ”
9:26:018:0	He also said , “ Why then is my lord pursuing his servant ? For what have I done ? Or what evil is in my hand ?
9:26:019:0	Now therefore , please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant . If the Lord has stirred you up against me , let Him accept an offering ; but if it is men , cursed are they before the Lord , for they have driven me out today so that I would have no attachment with the inheritance of the Lord , saying , ‘Go , serve other gods . ’
9:26:020:0	Now then , do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the Lord ; for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea , just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains . ”
9:26:021:0	Then Saul said , “ I have sinned . Return , my son David , for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day . Behold , I have played the fool and have committed a serious error . ”
9:26:022:0	David replied , “ Behold the spear of the king ! Now let one of the young men come over and take it .
9:26:023:0	The Lord will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness ; for the Lord delivered you into my hand today , but I refused to stretch out my hand against the Lord’s anointed .
9:26:024:0	Now behold , as your life was highly valued in my sight this day , so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the Lord , and may He deliver me from all distress . ”
9:26:025:0	Then Saul said to David , “ Blessed are you , my son David ; you will both accomplish much and surely prevail . ” So David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
