9:16:001:1	Samuel Goes to Bethlehem
9:16:001:0	Now the Lord said to Samuel , “ How long will you grieve over Saul , since I have rejected him from being king over Israel ? Fill your horn with oil and go ; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite , for I have selected a king for Myself among his sons . ”
9:16:002:0	But Samuel said , “ How can I go ? When Saul hears of it , he will kill me . ” And the Lord said , “ Take a heifer with you and say , ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord . ’
9:16:003:0	You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will show you what you shall do ; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you . ”
9:16:004:0	So Samuel did what the Lord said , and came to Bethlehem . And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said , “ Do you come in peace ? ”
9:16:005:0	He said , “ In peace ; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord . Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice . ” He also consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice .
9:16:006:0	When they entered , he looked at Eliab and thought , “ Surely the Lord’s anointed is before Him . ”
9:16:007:0	But the Lord said to Samuel , “ Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature , because I have rejected him ; for God sees not as man sees , for man looks at the outward appearance , but the Lord looks at the heart . ”
9:16:008:0	Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel . And he said , “ The Lord has not chosen this one either . ”
9:16:009:0	Next Jesse made Shammah pass by . And he said , “ The Lord has not chosen this one either . ”
9:16:010:0	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel . But Samuel said to Jesse , “ The Lord has not chosen these . ”
9:16:002:1	David Anointed
9:16:011:0	And Samuel said to Jesse , “ Are these all the children ? ” And he said , “ There remains yet the youngest , and behold , he is tending the sheep . ” Then Samuel said to Jesse , “ Send and bring him ; for we will not sit down until he comes here . ”
9:16:012:0	So he sent and brought him in . Now he was ruddy , with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance . And the Lord said , “ Arise , anoint him ; for this is he . ”
9:16:013:0	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers ; and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward . And Samuel arose and went to Ramah .
9:16:014:0	Now the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from the Lord terrorized him .
9:16:015:0	Saul’s servants then said to him , “ Behold now , an evil spirit from God is terrorizing you .
9:16:016:0	Let our lord now command your servants who are before you . Let them seek a man who is a skillful player on the harp ; and it shall come about when the evil spirit from God is on you , that he shall play the harp with his hand , and you will be well . ”
9:16:017:0	So Saul said to his servants , “ Provide for me now a man who can play well and bring him to me . ”
9:16:018:0	Then one of the young men said , “ Behold , I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician , a mighty man of valor , a warrior , one prudent in speech , and a handsome man ; and the Lord is with him . ”
9:16:019:0	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said , “ Send me your son David who is with the flock . ”
9:16:020:0	Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a jug of wine and a young goat , and sent them to Saul by David his son .
9:16:021:0	Then David came to Saul and attended him ; and Saul loved him greatly , and he became his armor bearer .
9:16:022:0	Saul sent to Jesse , saying , “ Let David now stand before me , for he has found favor in my sight . ”
9:16:023:0	So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul , David would take the harp and play it with his hand ; and Saul would be refreshed and be well , and the evil spirit would depart from him .
