9:20:001:1	David and Jonathan Covenant
9:20:001:0	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said to Jonathan , “ What have I done ? What is my iniquity ? And what is my sin before your father , that he is seeking my life ? ”
9:20:002:0	He said to him , “ Far from it , you shall not die . Behold , my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me . So why should my father hide this thing from me ? It is not so ! ”
9:20:003:0	Yet David vowed again , saying , “ Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight , and he has said , ‘Do not let Jonathan know this , or he will be grieved . ’ But truly as the Lord lives and as your soul lives , there is hardly a step between me and death . ”
9:20:004:0	Then Jonathan said to David , “ Whatever you say , I will do for you . ”
9:20:005:0	So David said to Jonathan , “ Behold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I ought to sit down to eat with the king . But let me go , that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening .
9:20:006:0	If your father misses me at all , then say , ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city , because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family . ’
9:20:007:0	If he says , ‘It is good , ’ your servant will be safe ; but if he is very angry , know that he has decided on evil .
9:20:008:0	Therefore deal kindly with your servant , for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you . But if there is iniquity in me , put me to death yourself ; for why then should you bring me to your father ? ”
9:20:009:0	Jonathan said , “ Far be it from you ! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you , then would I not tell you about it ? ”
9:20:010:0	Then David said to Jonathan , “ Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly ? ”
9:20:011:0	Jonathan said to David , “ Come , and let us go out into the field . ” So both of them went out to the field .
9:20:012:0	Then Jonathan said to David , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , be witness ! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow , or the third day , behold , if there is good feeling toward David , shall I not then send to you and make it known to you ?
9:20:013:0	If it please my father to do you harm , may the Lord do so to Jonathan and more also , if I do not make it known to you and send you away , that you may go in safety . And may the Lord be with you as He has been with my father .
9:20:014:0	If I am still alive , will you not show me the lovingkindness of the Lord , that I may not die ?
9:20:015:0	You shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever , not even when the Lord cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth . ”
9:20:016:0	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David , saying , “ May the Lord require it at the hands of David’s enemies . ”
9:20:017:0	Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him , because he loved him as he loved his own life .
9:20:018:0	Then Jonathan said to him , “ Tomorrow is the new moon , and you will be missed because your seat will be empty .
9:20:019:0	When you have stayed for three days , you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day , and you shall remain by the stone Ezel .
9:20:020:0	I will shoot three arrows to the side , as though I shot at a target .
9:20:021:0	And behold , I will send the lad , saying , ‘Go , find the arrows . ’ If I specifically say to the lad , ‘Behold , the arrows are on this side of you , get them , ’ then come ; for there is safety for you and no harm , as the Lord lives .
9:20:022:0	But if I say to the youth , ‘Behold , the arrows are beyond you , ’ go , for the Lord has sent you away .
9:20:023:0	As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken , behold , the Lord is between you and me forever . ”
9:20:024:0	So David hid in the field ; and when the new moon came , the king sat down to eat food .
9:20:025:0	The king sat on his seat as usual , the seat by the wall ; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side , but David’s place was empty .
9:20:026:0	Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day , for he thought , “ It is an accident , he is not clean , surely he is not clean . ”
9:20:027:0	It came about the next day , the second day of the new moon , that David’s place was empty ; so Saul said to Jonathan his son , “ Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal , either yesterday or today ? ”
9:20:028:0	Jonathan then answered Saul , “ David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem ,
9:20:002:1	Saul Is Angry with Jonathan
9:20:029:0	for he said , ‘Please let me go , since our family has a sacrifice in the city , and my brother has commanded me to attend . And now , if I have found favor in your sight , please let me get away that I may see my brothers . ’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table . ”
9:20:030:0	Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him , “ You son of a perverse , rebellious woman ! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness ?
9:20:031:0	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth , neither you nor your kingdom will be established . Therefore now , send and bring him to me , for he must surely die . ”
9:20:032:0	But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him , “ Why should he be put to death ? What has he done ? ”
9:20:033:0	Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down ; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death .
9:20:034:0	Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon , for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him .
9:20:035:0	Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David , and a little lad was with him .
9:20:036:0	He said to his lad , “ Run , find now the arrows which I am about to shoot . ” As the lad was running , he shot an arrow past him .
9:20:037:0	When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan called after the lad and said , “ Is not the arrow beyond you ? ”
9:20:038:0	And Jonathan called after the lad , “ Hurry , be quick , do not stay ! ” And Jonathan’s lad picked up the arrow and came to his master .
9:20:039:0	But the lad was not aware of anything ; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter .
9:20:040:0	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him , “ Go , bring them to the city . ”
9:20:041:0	When the lad was gone , David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed three times . And they kissed each other and wept together , but David wept the more .
9:20:042:0	Jonathan said to David , “ Go in safety , inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the Lord , saying , ‘The Lord will be between me and you , and between my descendants and your descendants forever . ’ ” Then he rose and departed , while Jonathan went into the city .
