9:14:001:1	Jonathan’s Victory
9:14:001:0	Now the day came that Jonathan , the son of Saul , said to the young man who was carrying his armor , “ Come and let us cross over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side . ” But he did not tell his father .
9:14:002:0	Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron . And the people who were with him were about six hundred men ,
9:14:003:0	and Ahijah , the son of Ahitub , Ichabod’s brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the priest of the Lord at Shiloh , was wearing an ephod . And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone .
9:14:004:0	Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines’ garrison , there was a sharp crag on the one side and a sharp crag on the other side , and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
9:14:005:0	The one crag rose on the north opposite Michmash , and the other on the south opposite Geba .
9:14:006:0	Then Jonathan said to the young man who was carrying his armor , “ Come and let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised ; perhaps the Lord will work for us , for the Lord is not restrained to save by many or by few . ”
9:14:007:0	His armor bearer said to him , “ Do all that is in your heart ; turn yourself , and here I am with you according to your desire . ”
9:14:008:0	Then Jonathan said , “ Behold , we will cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them .
9:14:009:0	If they say to us , ‘Wait until we come to you’ ; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them .
9:14:010:0	But if they say , ‘Come up to us , ’ then we will go up , for the Lord has given them into our hands ; and this shall be the sign to us . ”
9:14:011:0	When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines , the Philistines said , “ Behold , Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves . ”
9:14:012:0	So the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor bearer and said , “ Come up to us and we will tell you something . ” And Jonathan said to his armor bearer , “ Come up after me , for the Lord has given them into the hands of Israel . ”
9:14:013:0	Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet , with his armor bearer behind him ; and they fell before Jonathan , and his armor bearer put some to death after him .
9:14:014:0	That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land .
9:14:015:0	And there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people . Even the garrison and the raiders trembled , and the earth quaked so that it became a great trembling .
9:14:016:0	Now Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked , and behold , the multitude melted away ; and they went here and there .
9:14:017:0	Saul said to the people who were with him , “ Number now and see who has gone from us . ” And when they had numbered , behold , Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there .
9:14:018:0	Then Saul said to Ahijah , “ Bring the ark of God here . ” For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel .
9:14:019:0	While Saul talked to the priest , the commotion in the camp of the Philistines continued and increased ; so Saul said to the priest , “ Withdraw your hand . ”
9:14:020:0	Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and came to the battle ; and behold , every man’s sword was against his fellow , and there was very great confusion .
9:14:021:0	Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously , who went up with them all around in the camp , even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
9:14:022:0	When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled , even they also pursued them closely in the battle .
9:14:002:1	Saul’s Foolish Order
9:14:023:0	So the Lord delivered Israel that day , and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven .
9:14:024:0	Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day , for Saul had put the people under oath , saying , “ Cursed be the man who eats food before evening , and until I have avenged myself on my enemies . ” So none of the people tasted food .
9:14:025:0	All the people of the land entered the forest , and there was honey on the ground .
9:14:026:0	When the people entered the forest , behold , there was a flow of honey ; but no man put his hand to his mouth , for the people feared the oath .
9:14:027:0	But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under oath ; therefore , he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth , and his eyes brightened .
9:14:028:0	Then one of the people said , “ Your father strictly put the people under oath , saying , ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today . ’ ” And the people were weary .
9:14:029:0	Then Jonathan said , “ My father has troubled the land . See now , how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey .
9:14:030:0	How much more , if only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found ! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great . ”
9:14:031:0	They struck among the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon . And the people were very weary .
9:14:032:0	The people rushed greedily upon the spoil , and took sheep and oxen and calves , and slew them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
9:14:033:0	Then they told Saul , saying , “ Behold , the people are sinning against the Lord by eating with the blood . ” And he said , “ You have acted treacherously ; roll a great stone to me today . ”
9:14:034:0	Saul said , “ Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them , ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep , and slaughter it here and eat ; and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood . ’ ” So all the people that night brought each one his ox with him and slaughtered it there .
9:14:035:0	And Saul built an altar to the Lord ; it was the first altar that he built to the Lord .
9:14:036:0	Then Saul said , “ Let us go down after the Philistines by night and take spoil among them until the morning light , and let us not leave a man of them . ” And they said , “ Do whatever seems good to you . ” So the priest said , “ Let us draw near to God here . ”
9:14:037:0	Saul inquired of God , “ Shall I go down after the Philistines ? Will You give them into the hand of Israel ? ” But He did not answer him on that day .
9:14:038:0	Saul said , “ Draw near here , all you chiefs of the people , and investigate and see how this sin has happened today .
9:14:039:0	For as the Lord lives , who delivers Israel , though it is in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . ” But not one of all the people answered him .
9:14:040:0	Then he said to all Israel , “ You shall be on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . ” And the people said to Saul , “ Do what seems good to you . ”
9:14:041:0	Therefore , Saul said to the Lord , the God of Israel , “ Give a perfect lot . ” And Jonathan and Saul were taken , but the people escaped .
9:14:042:0	Saul said , “ Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son . ” And Jonathan was taken .
9:14:043:0	Then Saul said to Jonathan , “ Tell me what you have done . ” So Jonathan told him and said , “ I indeed tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand . Here I am , I must die ! ”
9:14:044:0	Saul said , “ May God do this to me and more also , for you shall surely die , Jonathan . ”
9:14:045:0	But the people said to Saul , “ Must Jonathan die , who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel ? Far from it ! As the Lord lives , not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground , for he has worked with God this day . ” So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die .
9:14:003:1	Constant Warfare
9:14:046:0	Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines , and the Philistines went to their own place .
9:14:047:0	Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel , he fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , the sons of Ammon , Edom , the kings of Zobah , and the Philistines ; and wherever he turned , he inflicted punishment .
9:14:048:0	He acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites , and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them .
9:14:049:0	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal .
9:14:050:0	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz . And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner , Saul’s uncle .
9:14:051:0	Kish was the father of Saul , and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
9:14:052:0	Now the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul ; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man , he attached him to his staff .
