9:3:001:1	The Prophetic Call to Samuel
9:3:001:0	Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord before Eli . And word from the Lord was rare in those days , visions were infrequent .
9:3:002:0	It happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place ( now his eyesight had begun to grow dim and he could not see well ) ,
9:3:003:0	and the lamp of God had not yet gone out , and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was ,
9:3:004:0	that the Lord called Samuel ; and he said , “ Here I am . ”
9:3:005:0	Then he ran to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me . ” But he said , “ I did not call , lie down again . ” So he went and lay down .
9:3:006:0	The Lord called yet again , “ Samuel ! ” So Samuel arose and went to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me . ” But he answered , “ I did not call , my son , lie down again . ”
9:3:007:0	Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , nor had the word of the Lord yet been revealed to him .
9:3:008:0	So the Lord called Samuel again for the third time . And he arose and went to Eli and said , “ Here I am , for you called me . ” Then Eli discerned that the Lord was calling the boy .
9:3:009:0	And Eli said to Samuel , “ Go lie down , and it shall be if He calls you , that you shall say , ‘Speak , Lord , for Your servant is listening . ’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
9:3:010:0	Then the Lord came and stood and called as at other times , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” And Samuel said , “ Speak , for Your servant is listening . ”
9:3:011:0	The Lord said to Samuel , “ Behold , I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle .
9:3:012:0	In that day I will carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house , from beginning to end .
9:3:013:0	For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them .
9:3:014:0	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever . ”
9:3:015:0	So Samuel lay down until morning . Then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord . But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli .
9:3:016:0	Then Eli called Samuel and said , “ Samuel , my son . ” And he said , “ Here I am . ”
9:3:017:0	He said , “ What is the word that He spoke to you ? Please do not hide it from me . May God do so to you , and more also , if you hide anything from me of all the words that He spoke to you . ”
9:3:018:0	So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him . And he said , “ It is the Lord ; let Him do what seems good to Him . ”
9:3:019:0	Thus Samuel grew and the Lord was with him and let none of his words fail .
9:3:020:0	All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the Lord .
9:3:021:0	And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh , because the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord .
