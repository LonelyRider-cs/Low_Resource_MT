9:28:001:1	Saul and the Spirit Medium
9:28:001:0	Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war , to fight against Israel . And Achish said to David , “ Know assuredly that you will go out with me in the camp , you and your men . ”
9:28:002:0	David said to Achish , “ Very well , you shall know what your servant can do . ” So Achish said to David , “ Very well , I will make you my bodyguard for life . ”
9:28:003:0	Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah , his own city . And Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists .
9:28:004:0	So the Philistines gathered together and came and camped in Shunem ; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped in Gilboa .
9:28:005:0	When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines , he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly .
9:28:006:0	When Saul inquired of the Lord , the Lord did not answer him , either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets .
9:28:007:0	Then Saul said to his servants , “ Seek for me a woman who is a medium , that I may go to her and inquire of her . ” And his servants said to him , “ Behold , there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor . ”
9:28:008:0	Then Saul disguised himself by putting on other clothes , and went , he and two men with him , and they came to the woman by night ; and he said , “ Conjure up for me , please , and bring up for me whom I shall name to you . ”
9:28:009:0	But the woman said to him , “ Behold , you know what Saul has done , how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land . Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death ? ”
9:28:010:0	Saul vowed to her by the Lord , saying , “ As the Lord lives , no punishment shall come upon you for this thing . ”
9:28:011:0	Then the woman said , “ Whom shall I bring up for you ? ” And he said , “ Bring up Samuel for me . ”
9:28:012:0	When the woman saw Samuel , she cried out with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , “ Why have you deceived me ? For you are Saul . ”
9:28:013:0	The king said to her , “ Do not be afraid ; but what do you see ? ” And the woman said to Saul , “ I see a divine being coming up out of the earth . ”
9:28:014:0	He said to her , “ What is his form ? ” And she said , “ An old man is coming up , and he is wrapped with a robe . ” And Saul knew that it was Samuel , and he bowed with his face to the ground and did homage .
9:28:015:0	Then Samuel said to Saul , “ Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up ? ” And Saul answered , “ I am greatly distressed ; for the Philistines are waging war against me , and God has departed from me and no longer answers me , either through prophets or by dreams ; therefore I have called you , that you may make known to me what I should do . ”
9:28:016:0	Samuel said , “ Why then do you ask me , since the Lord has departed from you and has become your adversary ?
9:28:017:0	The Lord has done accordingly as He spoke through me ; for the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor , to David .
9:28:018:0	As you did not obey the Lord and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek , so the Lord has done this thing to you this day .
9:28:019:0	Moreover the Lord will also give over Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines , therefore tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Indeed the Lord will give over the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines ! ”
9:28:020:0	Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground and was very afraid because of the words of Samuel ; also there was no strength in him , for he had eaten no food all day and all night .
9:28:021:0	The woman came to Saul and saw that he was terrified , and said to him , “ Behold , your maidservant has obeyed you , and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me .
9:28:022:0	So now also , please listen to the voice of your maidservant , and let me set a piece of bread before you that you may eat and have strength when you go on your way . ”
9:28:023:0	But he refused and said , “ I will not eat . ” However , his servants together with the woman urged him , and he listened to them . So he arose from the ground and sat on the bed .
9:28:024:0	The woman had a fattened calf in the house , and she quickly slaughtered it ; and she took flour , kneaded it and baked unleavened bread from it .
9:28:025:0	She brought it before Saul and his servants , and they ate . Then they arose and went away that night .
