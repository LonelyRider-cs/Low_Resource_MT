9:10:001:1	Saul among Prophets
9:10:001:0	Then Samuel took the flask of oil , poured it on his head , kissed him and said , “ Has not the Lord anointed you a ruler over His inheritance ?
9:10:002:0	When you go from me today , then you will find two men close to Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah ; and they will say to you , ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found . Now behold , your father has ceased to be concerned about the donkeys and is anxious for you , saying , “ What shall I do about my son ? ” ’
9:10:003:0	Then you will go on further from there , and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor , and there three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you , one carrying three young goats , another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a jug of wine ;
9:10:004:0	and they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread , which you will accept from their hand .
9:10:005:0	Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is ; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city , that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp , tambourine , flute , and a lyre before them , and they will be prophesying .
9:10:006:0	Then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you mightily , and you shall prophesy with them and be changed into another man .
9:10:007:0	It shall be when these signs come to you , do for yourself what the occasion requires , for God is with you .
9:10:008:0	And you shall go down before me to Gilgal ; and behold , I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings . You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you should do . ”
9:10:009:0	Then it happened when he turned his back to leave Samuel , God changed his heart ; and all those signs came about on that day .
9:10:010:0	When they came to the hill there , behold , a group of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him mightily , so that he prophesied among them .
9:10:011:0	It came about , when all who knew him previously saw that he prophesied now with the prophets , that the people said to one another , “ What has happened to the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
9:10:012:0	A man there said , “ Now , who is their father ? ” Therefore it became a proverb : “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”
9:10:013:0	When he had finished prophesying , he came to the high place .
9:10:014:0	Now Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant , “ Where did you go ? ” And he said , “ To look for the donkeys . When we saw that they could not be found , we went to Samuel . ”
9:10:015:0	Saul’s uncle said , “ Please tell me what Samuel said to you . ”
9:10:002:1	Saul Publicly Chosen King
9:10:016:0	So Saul said to his uncle , “ He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found . ” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned .
9:10:017:0	Thereafter Samuel called the people together to the Lord at Mizpah ;
9:10:018:0	and he said to the sons of Israel , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt , and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you . ’
9:10:019:0	But you have today rejected your God , who delivers you from all your calamities and your distresses ; yet you have said , ‘No , but set a king over us ! ’ Now therefore , present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your clans . ”
9:10:020:0	Thus Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near , and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot .
9:10:021:0	Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families , and the Matrite family was taken . And Saul the son of Kish was taken ; but when they looked for him , he could not be found .
9:10:022:0	Therefore they inquired further of the Lord , “ Has the man come here yet ? ” So the Lord said , “ Behold , he is hiding himself by the baggage . ”
9:10:023:0	So they ran and took him from there , and when he stood among the people , he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward .
9:10:024:0	Samuel said to all the people , “ Do you see him whom the Lord has chosen ? Surely there is no one like him among all the people . ” So all the people shouted and said , “ Long live the king ! ”
9:10:025:0	Then Samuel told the people the ordinances of the kingdom , and wrote them in the book and placed it before the Lord . And Samuel sent all the people away , each one to his house .
9:10:026:0	Saul also went to his house at Gibeah ; and the valiant men whose hearts God had touched went with him .
9:10:027:0	But certain worthless men said , “ How can this one deliver us ? ” And they despised him and did not bring him any present . But he kept silent .
