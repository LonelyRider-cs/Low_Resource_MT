9:4:001:1	Philistines Take the Ark in Victory
9:4:001:0	Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel . Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek .
9:4:002:0	The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel . When the battle spread , Israel was defeated before the Philistines who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield .
9:4:003:0	When the people came into the camp , the elders of Israel said , “ Why has the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines ? Let us take to ourselves from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the Lord , that it may come among us and deliver us from the power of our enemies . ”
9:4:004:0	So the people sent to Shiloh , and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts who sits above the cherubim ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the ark of the covenant of God .
9:4:005:0	As the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth resounded .
9:4:006:0	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , “ What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean ? ” Then they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp .
9:4:007:0	The Philistines were afraid , for they said , “ God has come into the camp . ” And they said , “ Woe to us ! For nothing like this has happened before .
9:4:008:0	Woe to us ! Who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods ? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness .
9:4:009:0	Take courage and be men , O Philistines , or you will become slaves to the Hebrews , as they have been slaves to you ; therefore , be men and fight . ”
9:4:010:0	So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated , and every man fled to his tent ; and the slaughter was very great , for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers .
9:4:011:0	And the ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , died .
9:4:012:0	Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head .
9:4:013:0	When he came , behold , Eli was sitting on his seat by the road eagerly watching , because his heart was trembling for the ark of God . So the man came to tell it in the city , and all the city cried out .
9:4:014:0	When Eli heard the noise of the outcry , he said , “ What does the noise of this commotion mean ? ” Then the man came hurriedly and told Eli .
9:4:015:0	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old , and his eyes were set so that he could not see .
9:4:016:0	The man said to Eli , “ I am the one who came from the battle line . Indeed , I escaped from the battle line today . ” And he said , “ How did things go , my son ? ”
9:4:017:0	Then the one who brought the news replied , “ Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people , and your two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God has been taken . ”
9:4:018:0	When he mentioned the ark of God , Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate , and his neck was broken and he died , for he was old and heavy . Thus he judged Israel forty years .
9:4:019:0	Now his daughter-in-law , Phinehas’s wife , was pregnant and about to give birth ; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died , she kneeled down and gave birth , for her pains came upon her .
9:4:020:0	And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , “ Do not be afraid , for you have given birth to a son . ” But she did not answer or pay attention .
9:4:021:0	And she called the boy Ichabod , saying , “ The glory has departed from Israel , ” because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband .
9:4:022:0	She said , “ The glory has departed from Israel , for the ark of God was taken . ”
