9:24:001:1	David Spares Saul’s Life
9:24:001:0	Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines , he was told , saying , “ Behold , David is in the wilderness of Engedi . ”
9:24:002:0	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats .
9:24:003:0	He came to the sheepfolds on the way , where there was a cave ; and Saul went in to relieve himself . Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave .
9:24:004:0	The men of David said to him , “ Behold , this is the day of which the Lord said to you , ‘Behold ; I am about to give your enemy into your hand , and you shall do to him as it seems good to you . ’ ” Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly .
9:24:005:0	It came about afterward that David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe .
9:24:006:0	So he said to his men , “ Far be it from me because of the Lord that I should do this thing to my lord , the Lord’s anointed , to stretch out my hand against him , since he is the Lord’s anointed . ”
9:24:007:0	David persuaded his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul . And Saul arose , left the cave , and went on his way .
9:24:008:0	Now afterward David arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul , saying , “ My lord the king ! ” And when Saul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself .
9:24:009:0	David said to Saul , “ Why do you listen to the words of men , saying , ‘Behold , David seeks to harm you’ ?
9:24:010:0	Behold , this day your eyes have seen that the Lord had given you today into my hand in the cave , and some said to kill you , but my eye had pity on you ; and I said , ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord , for he is the Lord’s anointed . ’
9:24:011:0	Now , my father , see ! Indeed , see the edge of your robe in my hand ! For in that I cut off the edge of your robe and did not kill you , know and perceive that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands , and I have not sinned against you , though you are lying in wait for my life to take it .
9:24:012:0	May the Lord judge between you and me , and may the Lord avenge me on you ; but my hand shall not be against you .
9:24:013:0	As the proverb of the ancients says , ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’ ; but my hand shall not be against you .
9:24:014:0	After whom has the king of Israel come out ? Whom are you pursuing ? A dead dog , a single flea ?
9:24:015:0	The Lord therefore be judge and decide between you and me ; and may He see and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand . ”
9:24:016:0	When David had finished speaking these words to Saul , Saul said , “ Is this your voice , my son David ? ” Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept .
9:24:017:0	He said to David , “ You are more righteous than I ; for you have dealt well with me , while I have dealt wickedly with you .
9:24:018:0	You have declared today that you have done good to me , that the Lord delivered me into your hand and yet you did not kill me .
9:24:019:0	For if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away safely ? May the Lord therefore reward you with good in return for what you have done to me this day .
9:24:020:0	Now , behold , I know that you will surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand .
9:24:021:0	So now swear to me by the Lord that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s household . ”
9:24:022:0	David swore to Saul . And Saul went to his home , but David and his men went up to the stronghold .
