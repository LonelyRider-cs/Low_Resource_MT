9:29:001:1	The Philistines Mistrust David
9:29:001:0	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek , while the Israelites were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel .
9:29:002:0	And the lords of the Philistines were proceeding on by hundreds and by thousands , and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish .
9:29:003:0	Then the commanders of the Philistines said , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines , “ Is this not David , the servant of Saul the king of Israel , who has been with me these days , or rather these years , and I have found no fault in him from the day he deserted to me to this day ? ”
9:29:004:0	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him , and the commanders of the Philistines said to him , “ Make the man go back , that he may return to his place where you have assigned him , and do not let him go down to battle with us , or in the battle he may become an adversary to us . For with what could this man make himself acceptable to his lord ? Would it not be with the heads of these men ?
9:29:005:0	Is this not David , of whom they sing in the dances , saying , ‘Saul has slain his thousands , And David his ten thousands’ ? ”
9:29:006:0	Then Achish called David and said to him , “ As the Lord lives , you have been upright , and your going out and your coming in with me in the army are pleasing in my sight ; for I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day . Nevertheless , you are not pleasing in the sight of the lords .
9:29:007:0	Now therefore return and go in peace , that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines . ”
9:29:008:0	David said to Achish , “ But what have I done ? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I came before you to this day , that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
9:29:009:0	But Achish replied to David , “ I know that you are pleasing in my sight , like an angel of God ; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said , ‘He must not go up with us to the battle . ’
9:29:010:0	Now then arise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you , and as soon as you have arisen early in the morning and have light , depart . ”
9:29:011:0	So David arose early , he and his men , to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines . And the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
