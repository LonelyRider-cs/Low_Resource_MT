9:21:001:1	David Takes Consecrated Bread
9:21:001:0	Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest ; and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him , “ Why are you alone and no one with you ? ”
9:21:002:0	David said to Ahimelech the priest , “ The king has commissioned me with a matter and has said to me , ‘Let no one know anything about the matter on which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you ; and I have directed the young men to a certain place . ’
9:21:003:0	Now therefore , what do you have on hand ? Give me five loaves of bread , or whatever can be found . ”
9:21:004:0	The priest answered David and said , “ There is no ordinary bread on hand , but there is consecrated bread ; if only the young men have kept themselves from women . ”
9:21:005:0	David answered the priest and said to him , “ Surely women have been kept from us as previously when I set out and the vessels of the young men were holy , though it was an ordinary journey ; how much more then today will their vessels be holy ? ”
9:21:006:0	So the priest gave him consecrated bread ; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence which was removed from before the Lord , in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away .
9:21:007:0	Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg the Edomite , the chief of Saul’s shepherds .
9:21:008:0	David said to Ahimelech , “ Now is there not a spear or a sword on hand ? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king’s matter was urgent . ”
9:21:009:0	Then the priest said , “ The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you killed in the valley of Elah , behold , it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod ; if you would take it for yourself , take it . For there is no other except it here . ” And David said , “ There is none like it ; give it to me . ”
9:21:010:0	Then David arose and fled that day from Saul , and went to Achish king of Gath .
9:21:011:0	But the servants of Achish said to him , “ Is this not David the king of the land ? Did they not sing of this one as they danced , saying , ‘Saul has slain his thousands , And David his ten thousands’ ? ”
9:21:012:0	David took these words to heart and greatly feared Achish king of Gath .
9:21:013:0	So he disguised his sanity before them , and acted insanely in their hands , and scribbled on the doors of the gate , and let his saliva run down into his beard .
9:21:014:0	Then Achish said to his servants , “ Behold , you see the man behaving as a madman . Why do you bring him to me ?
9:21:015:0	Do I lack madmen , that you have brought this one to act the madman in my presence ? Shall this one come into my house ? ”
