9:25:001:1	Samuel’s Death
9:25:002:1	Nabal and Abigail
9:25:001:0	Then Samuel died ; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him , and buried him at his house in Ramah . And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
9:25:002:0	Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel ; and the man was very rich , and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats . And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel
9:25:003:0	( now the man’s name was Nabal , and his wife’s name was Abigail . And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance , but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings , and he was a Calebite ) ,
9:25:004:0	that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep .
9:25:005:0	So David sent ten young men ; and David said to the young men , “ Go up to Carmel , visit Nabal and greet him in my name ;
9:25:006:0	and thus you shall say , ‘Have a long life , peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
9:25:007:0	Now I have heard that you have shearers ; now your shepherds have been with us and we have not insulted them , nor have they missed anything all the days they were in Carmel .
9:25:008:0	Ask your young men and they will tell you . Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes , for we have come on a festive day . Please give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David . ’ ”
9:25:009:0	When David’s young men came , they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in David’s name ; then they waited .
9:25:010:0	But Nabal answered David’s servants and said , “ Who is David ? And who is the son of Jesse ? There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master .
9:25:011:0	Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers , and give it to men whose origin I do not know ? ”
9:25:012:0	So David’s young men retraced their way and went back ; and they came and told him according to all these words .
9:25:013:0	David said to his men , “ Each of you gird on his sword . ” So each man girded on his sword . And David also girded on his sword , and about four hundred men went up behind David while two hundred stayed with the baggage .
9:25:014:0	But one of the young men told Abigail , Nabal’s wife , saying , “ Behold , David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master , and he scorned them .
9:25:015:0	Yet the men were very good to us , and we were not insulted , nor did we miss anything as long as we went about with them , while we were in the fields .
9:25:016:0	They were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the time we were with them tending the sheep .
9:25:003:1	Abigail Intercedes
9:25:017:0	Now therefore , know and consider what you should do , for evil is plotted against our master and against all his household ; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him . ”
9:25:018:0	Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread and two jugs of wine and five sheep already prepared and five measures of roasted grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs , and loaded them on donkeys .
9:25:019:0	She said to her young men , “ Go on before me ; behold , I am coming after you . ” But she did not tell her husband Nabal .
9:25:020:0	It came about as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain , that behold , David and his men were coming down toward her ; so she met them .
9:25:021:0	Now David had said , “ Surely in vain I have guarded all that this man has in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him ; and he has returned me evil for good .
9:25:022:0	May God do so to the enemies of David , and more also , if by morning I leave as much as one male of any who belong to him . ”
9:25:023:0	When Abigail saw David , she hurried and dismounted from her donkey , and fell on her face before David and bowed herself to the ground .
9:25:024:0	She fell at his feet and said , “ On me alone , my lord , be the blame . And please let your maidservant speak to you , and listen to the words of your maidservant .
9:25:025:0	Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man , Nabal , for as his name is , so is he . Nabal is his name and folly is with him ; but I your maidservant did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent .
9:25:026:0	“ Now therefore , my lord , as the Lord lives , and as your soul lives , since the Lord has restrained you from shedding blood , and from avenging yourself by your own hand , now then let your enemies and those who seek evil against my lord , be as Nabal .
9:25:027:0	Now let this gift which your maidservant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who accompany my lord .
9:25:028:0	Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant ; for the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house , because my lord is fighting the battles of the Lord , and evil will not be found in you all your days .
9:25:029:0	Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life , then the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God ; but the lives of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling .
9:25:030:0	And when the Lord does for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you , and appoints you ruler over Israel ,
9:25:031:0	this will not cause grief or a troubled heart to my lord , both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself . When the Lord deals well with my lord , then remember your maidservant . ”
9:25:032:0	Then David said to Abigail , “ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me ,
9:25:033:0	and blessed be your discernment , and blessed be you , who have kept me this day from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand .
9:25:034:0	Nevertheless , as the Lord God of Israel lives , who has restrained me from harming you , unless you had come quickly to meet me , surely there would not have been left to Nabal until the morning light as much as one male . ”
9:25:035:0	So David received from her hand what she had brought him and said to her , “ Go up to your house in peace . See , I have listened to you and granted your request . ”
9:25:036:0	Then Abigail came to Nabal , and behold , he was holding a feast in his house , like the feast of a king . And Nabal’s heart was merry within him , for he was very drunk ; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light .
9:25:037:0	But in the morning , when the wine had gone out of Nabal , his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him so that he became as a stone .
9:25:004:1	David Marries Abigail
9:25:038:0	About ten days later , the Lord struck Nabal and he died .
9:25:039:0	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , “ Blessed be the Lord , who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal and has kept back His servant from evil . The Lord has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head . ” Then David sent a proposal to Abigail , to take her as his wife .
9:25:040:0	When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel , they spoke to her , saying , “ David has sent us to you to take you as his wife . ”
9:25:041:0	She arose and bowed with her face to the ground and said , “ Behold , your maidservant is a maid to wash the feet of my lord’s servants . ”
9:25:042:0	Then Abigail quickly arose , and rode on a donkey , with her five maidens who attended her ; and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife .
9:25:043:0	David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel , and they both became his wives .
9:25:044:0	Now Saul had given Michal his daughter , David’s wife , to Palti the son of Laish , who was from Gallim .
