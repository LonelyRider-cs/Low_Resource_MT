9:8:001:1	Israel Demands a King
9:8:001:0	And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel .
9:8:002:0	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel , and the name of his second , Abijah ; they were judging in Beersheba .
9:8:003:0	His sons , however , did not walk in his ways , but turned aside after dishonest gain and took bribes and perverted justice .
9:8:004:0	Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah ;
9:8:005:0	and they said to him , “ Behold , you have grown old , and your sons do not walk in your ways . Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations . ”
9:8:006:0	But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said , “ Give us a king to judge us . ” And Samuel prayed to the Lord .
9:8:007:0	The Lord said to Samuel , “ Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you , for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected Me from being king over them .
9:8:008:0	Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also .
9:8:002:1	Warning concerning a King
9:8:009:0	Now then , listen to their voice ; however , you shall solemnly warn them and tell them of the procedure of the king who will reign over them . ”
9:8:010:0	So Samuel spoke all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked of him a king .
9:8:011:0	He said , “ This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you : he will take your sons and place them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots .
9:8:012:0	He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties , and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots .
9:8:013:0	He will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers .
9:8:014:0	He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants .
9:8:015:0	He will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants .
9:8:016:0	He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work .
9:8:017:0	He will take a tenth of your flocks , and you yourselves will become his servants .
9:8:018:0	Then you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves , but the Lord will not answer you in that day . ”
9:8:019:0	Nevertheless , the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel , and they said , “ No , but there shall be a king over us ,
9:8:020:0	that we also may be like all the nations , that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles . ”
9:8:021:0	Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people , he repeated them in the Lord’s hearing .
9:8:022:0	The Lord said to Samuel , “ Listen to their voice and appoint them a king . ” So Samuel said to the men of Israel , “ Go every man to his city . ”
