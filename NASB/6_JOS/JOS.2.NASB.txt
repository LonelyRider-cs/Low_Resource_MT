6:2:001:1	Rahab Shelters Spies
6:2:001:0	Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim , saying , “ Go , view the land , especially Jericho . ” So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab , and lodged there .
6:2:002:0	It was told the king of Jericho , saying , “ Behold , men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land . ”
6:2:003:0	And the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab , saying , “ Bring out the men who have come to you , who have entered your house , for they have come to search out all the land . ”
6:2:004:0	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them , and she said , “ Yes , the men came to me , but I did not know where they were from .
6:2:005:0	It came about when it was time to shut the gate at dark , that the men went out ; I do not know where the men went . Pursue them quickly , for you will overtake them . ”
6:2:006:0	But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof .
6:2:007:0	So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords ; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out , they shut the gate .
6:2:008:0	Now before they lay down , she came up to them on the roof ,
6:2:009:0	and said to the men , “ I know that the Lord has given you the land , and that the terror of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you .
6:2:010:0	For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt , and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon and Og , whom you utterly destroyed .
6:2:011:0	When we heard it , our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because of you ; for the Lord your God , He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath .
6:2:012:0	Now therefore , please swear to me by the Lord , since I have dealt kindly with you , that you also will deal kindly with my father’s household , and give me a pledge of truth ,
6:2:013:0	and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters , with all who belong to them , and deliver our lives from death . ”
6:2:002:1	The Promise to Rahab
6:2:014:0	So the men said to her , “ Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours ; and it shall come about when the Lord gives us the land that we will deal kindly and faithfully with you . ”
6:2:015:0	Then she let them down by a rope through the window , for her house was on the city wall , so that she was living on the wall .
6:2:016:0	She said to them , “ Go to the hill country , so that the pursuers will not happen upon you , and hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return . Then afterward you may go on your way . ”
6:2:017:0	The men said to her , “ We shall be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear ,
6:2:018:0	unless , when we come into the land , you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down , and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father’s household .
6:2:019:0	It shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street , his blood shall be on his own head , and we shall be free ; but anyone who is with you in the house , his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him .
6:2:020:0	But if you tell this business of ours , then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear . ”
6:2:021:0	She said , “ According to your words , so be it . ” So she sent them away , and they departed ; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window .
6:2:022:0	They departed and came to the hill country , and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned . Now the pursuers had sought them all along the road , but had not found them .
6:2:023:0	Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun , and they related to him all that had happened to them .
6:2:024:0	They said to Joshua , “ Surely the Lord has given all the land into our hands ; moreover , all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before us . ”
