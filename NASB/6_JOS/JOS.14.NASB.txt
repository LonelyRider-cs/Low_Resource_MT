6:14:001:1	Caleb’s Request
6:14:001:0	Now these are the territories which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them for an inheritance ,
6:14:002:0	by the lot of their inheritance , as the Lord commanded through Moses , for the nine tribes and the half-tribe .
6:14:003:0	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan ; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them .
6:14:004:0	For the sons of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim , and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land , except cities to live in , with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property .
6:14:005:0	Thus the sons of Israel did just as the Lord had commanded Moses , and they divided the land .
6:14:006:0	Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him , “ You know the word which the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea .
6:14:007:0	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land , and I brought word back to him as it was in my heart .
6:14:008:0	Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear ; but I followed the Lord my God fully .
6:14:009:0	So Moses swore on that day , saying , ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever , because you have followed the Lord my God fully . ’
6:14:010:0	Now behold , the Lord has let me live , just as He spoke , these forty-five years , from the time that the Lord spoke this word to Moses , when Israel walked in the wilderness ; and now behold , I am eighty-five years old today .
6:14:011:0	I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me ; as my strength was then , so my strength is now , for war and for going out and coming in .
6:14:012:0	Now then , give me this hill country about which the Lord spoke on that day , for you heard on that day that Anakim were there , with great fortified cities ; perhaps the Lord will be with me , and I will drive them out as the Lord has spoken . ”
6:14:013:0	So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance .
6:14:014:0	Therefore , Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day , because he followed the Lord God of Israel fully .
6:14:015:0	Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba ; for Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim . Then the land had rest from war .
