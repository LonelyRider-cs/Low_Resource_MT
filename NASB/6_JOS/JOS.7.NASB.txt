6:7:001:1	Israel Is Defeated at Ai
6:7:001:0	But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban , for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , from the tribe of Judah , took some of the things under the ban , therefore the anger of the Lord burned against the sons of Israel .
6:7:002:0	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is near Beth-aven , east of Bethel , and said to them , “ Go up and spy out the land . ” So the men went up and spied out Ai .
6:7:003:0	They returned to Joshua and said to him , “ Do not let all the people go up ; only about two or three thousand men need go up to Ai ; do not make all the people toil up there , for they are few . ”
6:7:004:0	So about three thousand men from the people went up there , but they fled from the men of Ai .
6:7:005:0	The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men , and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent , so the hearts of the people melted and became as water .
6:7:006:0	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until the evening , both he and the elders of Israel ; and they put dust on their heads .
6:7:007:0	Joshua said , “ Alas , O Lord God , why did You ever bring this people over the Jordan , only to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan !
6:7:008:0	O Lord , what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies ?
6:7:009:0	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it , and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth . And what will You do for Your great name ? ”
6:7:010:0	So the Lord said to Joshua , “ Rise up ! Why is it that you have fallen on your face ?
6:7:011:0	Israel has sinned , and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them . And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived . Moreover , they have also put them among their own things .
6:7:012:0	Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies ; they turn their backs before their enemies , for they have become accursed . I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from your midst .
6:7:013:0	Rise up ! Consecrate the people and say , ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow , for thus the Lord , the God of Israel , has said , “ There are things under the ban in your midst , O Israel . You cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst . ”
6:7:014:0	In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes . And it shall be that the tribe which the Lord takes by lot shall come near by families , and the family which the Lord takes shall come near by households , and the household which the Lord takes shall come near man by man .
6:7:002:1	The Sin of Achan
6:7:015:0	It shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire , he and all that belongs to him , because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord , and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel . ’ ”
6:7:016:0	So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes , and the tribe of Judah was taken .
6:7:017:0	He brought the family of Judah near , and he took the family of the Zerahites ; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man , and Zabdi was taken .
6:7:018:0	He brought his household near man by man ; and Achan , son of Carmi , son of Zabdi , son of Zerah , from the tribe of Judah , was taken .
6:7:019:0	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , I implore you , give glory to the Lord , the God of Israel , and give praise to Him ; and tell me now what you have done . Do not hide it from me . ”
6:7:020:0	So Achan answered Joshua and said , “ Truly , I have sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel , and this is what I did :
6:7:021:0	when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight , then I coveted them and took them ; and behold , they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it . ”
6:7:022:0	So Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent ; and behold , it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it .
6:7:023:0	They took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel , and they poured them out before the Lord .
6:7:024:0	Then Joshua and all Israel with him , took Achan the son of Zerah , the silver , the mantle , the bar of gold , his sons , his daughters , his oxen , his donkeys , his sheep , his tent and all that belonged to him ; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor .
6:7:025:0	Joshua said , “ Why have you troubled us ? The Lord will trouble you this day . ” And all Israel stoned them with stones ; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones .
6:7:026:0	They raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day , and the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger . Therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Achor to this day .
