6:10:001:1	Five Kings Attack Gibeon
6:10:001:0	Now it came about when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai , and had utterly destroyed it ( just as he had done to Jericho and its king , so he had done to Ai and its king ) , and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land ,
6:10:002:0	that he feared greatly , because Gibeon was a great city , like one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than Ai , and all its men were mighty .
6:10:003:0	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
6:10:004:0	“ Come up to me and help me , and let us attack Gibeon , for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel . ”
6:10:005:0	So the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon , gathered together and went up , they with all their armies , and camped by Gibeon and fought against it .
6:10:006:0	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal , saying , “ Do not abandon your servants ; come up to us quickly and save us and help us , for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us . ”
6:10:007:0	So Joshua went up from Gilgal , he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors .
6:10:008:0	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Do not fear them , for I have given them into your hands ; not one of them shall stand before you . ”
6:10:009:0	So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal .
6:10:010:0	And the Lord confounded them before Israel , and He slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah .
6:10:011:0	As they fled from before Israel , while they were at the descent of Beth-horon , the Lord threw large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah , and they died ; there were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword .
6:10:012:0	Then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel , “ O sun , stand still at Gibeon , And O moon in the valley of Aijalon . ”
6:10:013:0	So the sun stood still , and the moon stopped , Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies . Is it not written in the book of Jashar ? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day .
6:10:014:0	There was no day like that before it or after it , when the Lord listened to the voice of a man ; for the Lord fought for Israel .
6:10:002:1	Victory at Makkedah
6:10:015:0	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal .
6:10:016:0	Now these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah .
6:10:017:0	It was told Joshua , saying , “ The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah . ”
6:10:018:0	Joshua said , “ Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave , and assign men by it to guard them ,
6:10:019:0	but do not stay there yourselves ; pursue your enemies and attack them in the rear . Do not allow them to enter their cities , for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand . ”
6:10:020:0	It came about when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter , until they were destroyed , and the survivors who remained of them had entered the fortified cities ,
6:10:021:0	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace . No one uttered a word against any of the sons of Israel .
6:10:022:0	Then Joshua said , “ Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave . ”
6:10:023:0	They did so , and brought these five kings out to him from the cave : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
6:10:024:0	When they brought these kings out to Joshua , Joshua called for all the men of Israel , and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him , “ Come near , put your feet on the necks of these kings . ” So they came near and put their feet on their necks .
6:10:025:0	Joshua then said to them , “ Do not fear or be dismayed ! Be strong and courageous , for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies with whom you fight . ”
6:10:026:0	So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death , and he hanged them on five trees ; and they hung on the trees until evening .
6:10:027:0	It came about at sunset that Joshua gave a command , and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves , and put large stones over the mouth of the cave , to this very day .
6:10:003:1	Joshua’s Conquest of Southern Palestine
6:10:028:0	Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day , and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword ; he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it . He left no survivor . Thus he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho .
6:10:029:0	Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah , and fought against Libnah .
6:10:030:0	The Lord gave it also with its king into the hands of Israel , and he struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword . He left no survivor in it . Thus he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho .
6:10:031:0	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish , and they camped by it and fought against it .
6:10:032:0	The Lord gave Lachish into the hands of Israel ; and he captured it on the second day , and struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
6:10:033:0	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish , and Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivor .
6:10:034:0	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon , and they camped by it and fought against it .
6:10:035:0	They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword ; and he utterly destroyed that day every person who was in it , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
6:10:036:0	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron , and they fought against it .
6:10:037:0	They captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword . He left no survivor , according to all that he had done to Eglon . And he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it .
6:10:038:0	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir , and they fought against it .
6:10:039:0	He captured it and its king and all its cities , and they struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed every person who was in it . He left no survivor . Just as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir and its king , as he had also done to Libnah and its king .
6:10:040:0	Thus Joshua struck all the land , the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings . He left no survivor , but he utterly destroyed all who breathed , just as the Lord , the God of Israel , had commanded .
6:10:041:0	Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza , and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon .
6:10:042:0	Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time , because the Lord , the God of Israel , fought for Israel .
6:10:043:0	So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal .
