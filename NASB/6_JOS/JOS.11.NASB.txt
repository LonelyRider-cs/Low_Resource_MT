6:11:001:1	Northern Palestine Taken
6:11:001:0	Then it came about , when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph ,
6:11:002:0	and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country , and in the Arabah—south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and on the heights of Dor on the west—
6:11:003:0	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country , and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
6:11:004:0	They came out , they and all their armies with them , as many people as the sand that is on the seashore , with very many horses and chariots .
6:11:005:0	So all of these kings having agreed to meet , came and encamped together at the waters of Merom , to fight against Israel .
6:11:006:0	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Do not be afraid because of them , for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel ; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire . ”
6:11:007:0	So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom , and attacked them .
6:11:008:0	The Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , so that they defeated them , and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh to the east ; and they struck them until no survivor was left to them .
6:11:009:0	Joshua did to them as the Lord had told him ; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire .
6:11:010:0	Then Joshua turned back at that time , and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword ; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms .
6:11:011:0	They struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them ; there was no one left who breathed . And he burned Hazor with fire .
6:11:012:0	Joshua captured all the cities of these kings , and all their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded .
6:11:013:0	However , Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds , except Hazor alone , which Joshua burned .
6:11:014:0	All the spoil of these cities and the cattle , the sons of Israel took as their plunder ; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them . They left no one who breathed .
6:11:015:0	Just as the Lord had commanded Moses his servant , so Moses commanded Joshua , and so Joshua did ; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses .
6:11:016:0	Thus Joshua took all that land : the hill country and all the Negev , all that land of Goshen , the lowland , the Arabah , the hill country of Israel and its lowland
6:11:017:0	from Mount Halak , that rises toward Seir , even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon . And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death .
6:11:018:0	Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings .
6:11:019:0	There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon ; they took them all in battle .
6:11:020:0	For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts , to meet Israel in battle in order that he might utterly destroy them , that they might receive no mercy , but that he might destroy them , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
6:11:021:0	Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel . Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
6:11:022:0	There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel ; only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod some remained .
6:11:023:0	So Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the Lord had spoken to Moses , and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . Thus the land had rest from war .
