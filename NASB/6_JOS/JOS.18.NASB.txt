6:18:001:1	Rest of the Land Divided
6:18:001:0	Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh , and set up the tent of meeting there ; and the land was subdued before them .
6:18:002:0	There remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance .
6:18:003:0	So Joshua said to the sons of Israel , “ How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the Lord , the God of your fathers , has given you ?
6:18:004:0	Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them , and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance ; then they shall return to me .
6:18:005:0	They shall divide it into seven portions ; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south , and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north .
6:18:006:0	You shall describe the land in seven divisions , and bring the description here to me . I will cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
6:18:007:0	For the Levites have no portion among you , because the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance . Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them . ”
6:18:008:0	Then the men arose and went , and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land , saying , “ Go and walk through the land and describe it , and return to me ; then I will cast lots for you here before the Lord in Shiloh . ”
6:18:009:0	So the men went and passed through the land , and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book ; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh .
6:18:002:1	The Territory of Benjamin
6:18:010:0	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord , and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions .
6:18:011:0	Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families , and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph .
6:18:012:0	Their border on the north side was from the Jordan , then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north , and went up through the hill country westward , and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven .
6:18:013:0	From there the border continued to Luz , to the side of Luz ( that is , Bethel ) southward ; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar , near the hill which lies on the south of lower Beth-horon .
6:18:014:0	The border extended from there and turned round on the west side southward , from the hill which lies before Beth-horon southward ; and it ended at Kiriath-baal ( that is , Kiriath-jearim ) , a city of the sons of Judah . This was the west side .
6:18:015:0	Then the south side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim , and the border went westward and went to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah .
6:18:016:0	The border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom , which is in the valley of Rephaim northward ; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom , to the slope of the Jebusite southward , and went down to En-rogel .
6:18:017:0	It extended northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth , which is opposite the ascent of Adummim , and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
6:18:018:0	It continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward and went down to the Arabah .
6:18:019:0	The border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward ; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea , at the south end of the Jordan . This was the south border .
6:18:020:0	Moreover , the Jordan was its border on the east side . This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin , according to their families and according to its borders all around .
6:18:021:0	Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz ,
6:18:022:0	and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel ,
6:18:023:0	and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah ,
6:18:024:0	and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba ; twelve cities with their villages .
6:18:025:0	Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth ,
6:18:026:0	and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah ,
6:18:027:0	and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah ,
6:18:028:0	and Zelah , Haeleph and the Jebusite ( that is , Jerusalem ) , Gibeah , Kiriath ; fourteen cities with their villages . This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families .
