6:21:001:0	Then the heads of households of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel .
6:21:002:0	They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan , saying , “ The Lord commanded through Moses to give us cities to live in , with their pasture lands for our cattle . ”
6:21:003:0	So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands , according to the command of the Lord .
6:21:004:0	Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites . And the sons of Aaron the priest , who were of the Levites , received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin .

6:21:007:0	The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun .
6:21:008:0	Now the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands , as the Lord had commanded through Moses .
6:21:009:0	They gave these cities which are here mentioned by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon ;
6:21:010:0	and they were for the sons of Aaron , one of the families of the Kohathites , of the sons of Levi , for the lot was theirs first .
6:21:011:0	Thus they gave them Kiriath-arba , Arba being the father of Anak ( that is , Hebron ) , in the hill country of Judah , with its surrounding pasture lands .
6:21:012:0	But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession .
6:21:013:0	So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron , the city of refuge for the manslayer , with its pasture lands , and Libnah with its pasture lands ,
6:21:014:0	and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands ,

6:21:019:0	All the cities of the sons of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their pasture lands .
6:21:020:0	Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath , the Levites , even to the rest of the sons of Kohath .
6:21:021:0	They gave them Shechem , the city of refuge for the manslayer , with its pasture lands , in the hill country of Ephraim , and Gezer with its pasture lands ,
6:21:022:0	and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands ; four cities .

6:21:026:0	All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten .
6:21:027:0	To the sons of Gershon , one of the families of the Levites , from the half-tribe of Manasseh , they gave Golan in Bashan , the city of refuge for the manslayer , with its pasture lands , and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands ; two cities .

6:21:031:0	Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands ; four cities .
6:21:032:0	From the tribe of Naphtali , they gave Kedesh in Galilee , the city of refuge for the manslayer , with its pasture lands and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands ; three cities .
6:21:033:0	All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands .
6:21:034:0	To the families of the sons of Merari , the rest of the Levites , they gave from the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands .
6:21:035:0	Dimnah with its pasture lands , Nahalal with its pasture lands ; four cities .
6:21:036:0	From the tribe of Reuben , they gave Bezer with its pasture lands and Jahaz with its pasture lands ,
6:21:037:0	Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands ; four cities .

6:21:040:0	All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families , the rest of the families of the Levites ; and their lot was twelve cities .
6:21:041:0	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands .
6:21:042:0	These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands ; thus it was with all these cities .
6:21:043:0	So the Lord gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers , and they possessed it and lived in it .
6:21:044:0	And the Lord gave them rest on every side , according to all that He had sworn to their fathers , and no one of all their enemies stood before them ; the Lord gave all their enemies into their hand .
6:21:045:0	Not one of the good promises which the Lord had made to the house of Israel failed ; all came to pass .
