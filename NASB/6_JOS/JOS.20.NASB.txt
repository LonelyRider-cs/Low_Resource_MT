6:20:001:1	Six Cities of Refuge
6:20:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Joshua , saying ,
6:20:002:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel , saying , ‘Designate the cities of refuge , of which I spoke to you through Moses ,
6:20:003:0	that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally , without premeditation , may flee there , and they shall become your refuge from the avenger of blood .
6:20:004:0	He shall flee to one of these cities , and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city ; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place , so that he may dwell among them .
6:20:005:0	Now if the avenger of blood pursues him , then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand , because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand .
6:20:006:0	He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment , until the death of the one who is high priest in those days . Then the manslayer shall return to his own city and to his own house , to the city from which he fled . ’ ”
6:20:007:0	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
6:20:008:0	Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho , they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben , and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh .
6:20:009:0	These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them , that whoever kills any person unintentionally may flee there , and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation .
