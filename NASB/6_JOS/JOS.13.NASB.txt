6:13:001:1	Canaan Divided among the Tribes
6:13:001:0	Now Joshua was old and advanced in years when the Lord said to him , “ You are old and advanced in years , and very much of the land remains to be possessed .
6:13:002:0	This is the land that remains : all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites ;
6:13:003:0	from the Shihor which is east of Egypt , even as far as the border of Ekron to the north ( it is counted as Canaanite ) ; the five lords of the Philistines : the Gazite , the Ashdodite , the Ashkelonite , the Gittite , the Ekronite ; and the Avvite
6:13:004:0	to the south , all the land of the Canaanite , and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians , as far as Aphek , to the border of the Amorite ;
6:13:005:0	and the land of the Gebalite , and all of Lebanon , toward the east , from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath .
6:13:006:0	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim , all the Sidonians , I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel ; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you .
6:13:007:0	Now therefore , apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh . ”
6:13:008:0	With the other half-tribe , the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east , just as Moses the servant of the Lord gave to them ;
6:13:009:0	from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , with the city which is in the middle of the valley , and all the plain of Medeba , as far as Dibon ;
6:13:010:0	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , as far as the border of the sons of Ammon ;
6:13:011:0	and Gilead , and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites , and all Mount Hermon , and all Bashan as far as Salecah ;
6:13:012:0	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei ( he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim ) ; for Moses struck them and dispossessed them .
6:13:013:0	But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites ; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day .
6:13:014:0	Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance ; the offerings by fire to the Lord , the God of Israel , are their inheritance , as He spoke to him .
6:13:015:0	So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families .
6:13:016:0	Their territory was from Aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon , with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba ;
6:13:017:0	Heshbon , and all its cities which are on the plain : Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon ,
6:13:018:0	and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath ,
6:13:019:0	and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley ,
6:13:020:0	and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth ,
6:13:021:0	even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon , whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian , Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba , the princes of Sihon , who lived in the land .
6:13:022:0	The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor , the diviner , with the sword among the rest of their slain .
6:13:023:0	The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan . This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families , the cities and their villages .
6:13:024:0	Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad , to the sons of Gad , according to their families .
6:13:025:0	Their territory was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the sons of Ammon , as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah ;
6:13:026:0	and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim , and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir ;
6:13:027:0	and in the valley , Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , with the Jordan as a border , as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east .
6:13:028:0	This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families , the cities and their villages .
6:13:029:0	Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh ; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families .
6:13:030:0	Their territory was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , sixty cities ;
6:13:031:0	also half of Gilead , with Ashtaroth and Edrei , the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh , for half of the sons of Machir according to their families .
6:13:032:0	These are the territories which Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east .
6:13:033:0	But to the tribe of Levi , Moses did not give an inheritance ; the Lord , the God of Israel , is their inheritance , as He had promised to them .
