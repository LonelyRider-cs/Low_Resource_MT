6:15:001:1	Territory of Judah
6:15:001:0	Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom , southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south .
6:15:002:0	Their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea , from the bay that turns to the south .
6:15:003:0	Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin , then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron , and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka .
6:15:004:0	It continued to Azmon and proceeded to the brook of Egypt , and the border ended at the sea . This shall be your south border .
6:15:005:0	The east border was the Salt Sea , as far as the mouth of the Jordan . And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan .
6:15:006:0	Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah , and continued on the north of Beth-arabah , and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben .
6:15:007:0	The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor , and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim , which is on the south of the valley ; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and it ended at En-rogel .
6:15:008:0	Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south ( that is , Jerusalem ) ; and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west , which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north .
6:15:009:0	From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron , then the border curved to Baalah ( that is , Kiriath-jearim ) .

6:15:011:0	The border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward . Then the border curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel , and the border ended at the sea .
6:15:012:0	The west border was at the Great Sea , even its coastline . This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families .
6:15:013:0	Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah , according to the command of the Lord to Joshua , namely , Kiriath-arba , Arba being the father of Anak ( that is , Hebron ) .
6:15:014:0	Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak : Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai , the children of Anak .
6:15:015:0	Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir ; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher .
6:15:016:0	And Caleb said , “ The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it , I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife . ”
6:15:017:0	Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , captured it ; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife .
6:15:018:0	It came about that when she came to him , she persuaded him to ask her father for a field . So she alighted from the donkey , and Caleb said to her , “ What do you want ? ”
6:15:019:0	Then she said , “ Give me a blessing ; since you have given me the land of the Negev , give me also springs of water . ” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
6:15:020:0	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families .
