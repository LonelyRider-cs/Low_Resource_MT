6:6:001:1	The Conquest of Jericho
6:6:001:0	Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel ; no one went out and no one came in .
6:6:002:0	The Lord said to Joshua , “ See , I have given Jericho into your hand , with its king and the valiant warriors .
6:6:003:0	You shall march around the city , all the men of war circling the city once . You shall do so for six days .
6:6:004:0	Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark ; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times , and the priests shall blow the trumpets .
6:6:005:0	It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn , and when you hear the sound of the trumpet , all the people shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city will fall down flat , and the people will go up every man straight ahead . ”
6:6:006:0	So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them , “ Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord . ”
6:6:007:0	Then he said to the people , “ Go forward , and march around the city , and let the armed men go on before the ark of the Lord . ”
6:6:008:0	And it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Lord went forward and blew the trumpets ; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them .
6:6:009:0	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets , and the rear guard came after the ark , while they continued to blow the trumpets .
6:6:010:0	But Joshua commanded the people , saying , “ You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth , until the day I tell you , ‘Shout ! ’ Then you shall shout ! ”
6:6:011:0	So he had the ark of the Lord taken around the city , circling it once ; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp .
6:6:012:0	Now Joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the ark of the Lord .
6:6:013:0	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually , and blew the trumpets ; and the armed men went before them and the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord , while they continued to blow the trumpets .
6:6:014:0	Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp ; they did so for six days .
6:6:015:0	Then on the seventh day they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times ; only on that day they marched around the city seven times .
6:6:016:0	At the seventh time , when the priests blew the trumpets , Joshua said to the people , “ Shout ! For the Lord has given you the city .
6:6:017:0	The city shall be under the ban , it and all that is in it belongs to the Lord ; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live , because she hid the messengers whom we sent .
6:6:018:0	But as for you , only keep yourselves from the things under the ban , so that you do not covet them and take some of the things under the ban , and make the camp of Israel accursed and bring trouble on it .
6:6:019:0	But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the Lord ; they shall go into the treasury of the Lord . ”
6:6:020:0	So the people shouted , and priests blew the trumpets ; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet , the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat , so that the people went up into the city , every man straight ahead , and they took the city .
6:6:021:0	They utterly destroyed everything in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox and sheep and donkey , with the edge of the sword .
6:6:022:0	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land , “ Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman and all she has out of there , as you have sworn to her . ”
6:6:023:0	So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had ; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel .
6:6:024:0	They burned the city with fire , and all that was in it . Only the silver and gold , and articles of bronze and iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
6:6:025:0	However , Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all she had , Joshua spared ; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day , for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
6:6:026:0	Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time , saying , “ Cursed before the Lord is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho ; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation , and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up its gates . ”
6:6:027:0	So the Lord was with Joshua , and his fame was in all the land .
