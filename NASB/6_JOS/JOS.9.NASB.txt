6:9:001:1	Guile of the Gibeonites
6:9:001:0	Now it came about when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan , in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon , the Hittite and the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite and the Jebusite , heard of it ,
6:9:002:0	that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel .
6:9:003:0	When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai ,
6:9:004:0	they also acted craftily and set out as envoys , and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins worn-out and torn and mended ,
6:9:005:0	and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet , and worn-out clothes on themselves ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and had become crumbled .
6:9:006:0	They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel , “ We have come from a far country ; now therefore , make a covenant with us . ”
6:9:007:0	The men of Israel said to the Hivites , “ Perhaps you are living within our land ; how then shall we make a covenant with you ? ”
6:9:008:0	But they said to Joshua , “ We are your servants . ” Then Joshua said to them , “ Who are you and where do you come from ? ”
6:9:009:0	They said to him , “ Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of the Lord your God ; for we have heard the report of Him and all that He did in Egypt ,
6:9:010:0	and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth .
6:9:011:0	So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us , saying , ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey , and go to meet them and say to them , “ We are your servants ; now then , make a covenant with us . ” ’
6:9:012:0	This our bread was warm when we took it for our provisions out of our houses on the day that we left to come to you ; but now behold , it is dry and has become crumbled .
6:9:013:0	These wineskins which we filled were new , and behold , they are torn ; and these our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey . ”
6:9:014:0	So the men of Israel took some of their provisions , and did not ask for the counsel of the Lord .
6:9:015:0	Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them , to let them live ; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them .
6:9:016:0	It came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them , that they heard that they were neighbors and that they were living within their land .
6:9:017:0	Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day . Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim .
6:9:018:0	The sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord the God of Israel . And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders .
6:9:019:0	But all the leaders said to the whole congregation , “ We have sworn to them by the Lord , the God of Israel , and now we cannot touch them .
6:9:020:0	This we will do to them , even let them live , so that wrath will not be upon us for the oath which we swore to them . ”
6:9:021:0	The leaders said to them , “ Let them live . ” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation , just as the leaders had spoken to them .
6:9:022:0	Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them , saying , “ Why have you deceived us , saying , ‘We are very far from you , ’ when you are living within our land ?
6:9:023:0	Now therefore , you are cursed , and you shall never cease being slaves , both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God . ”
6:9:024:0	So they answered Joshua and said , “ Because it was certainly told your servants that the Lord your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you ; therefore we feared greatly for our lives because of you , and have done this thing .
6:9:025:0	Now behold , we are in your hands ; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us . ”
6:9:026:0	Thus he did to them , and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel , and they did not kill them .
6:9:027:0	But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord , to this day , in the place which He would choose .
