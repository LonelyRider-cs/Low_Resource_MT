39:3:001:1	The Purifier
39:3:001:0	“ Behold , I am going to send My messenger , and he will clear the way before Me . And the Lord , whom you seek , will suddenly come to His temple ; and the messenger of the covenant , in whom you delight , behold , He is coming , ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:3:002:0	“ But who can endure the day of His coming ? And who can stand when He appears ? For He is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap .
39:3:003:0	He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver , and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver , so that they may present to the Lord offerings in righteousness .
39:3:004:0	Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years .
39:3:005:0	“ Then I will draw near to you for judgment ; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely , and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages , the widow and the orphan , and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me , ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:3:006:0	“ For I , the Lord , do not change ; therefore you , O sons of Jacob , are not consumed .
39:3:002:1	You Have Robbed God
39:3:007:0	“ From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them . Return to Me , and I will return to you , ” says the Lord of hosts . “ But you say , ‘How shall we return ? ’
39:3:008:0	“ Will a man rob God ? Yet you are robbing Me ! But you say , ‘How have we robbed You ? ’ In tithes and offerings .
39:3:009:0	You are cursed with a curse , for you are robbing Me , the whole nation of you !
39:3:010:0	Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse , so that there may be food in My house , and test Me now in this , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows .
39:3:011:0	Then I will rebuke the devourer for you , so that it will not destroy the fruits of the ground ; nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes , ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:3:012:0	“ All the nations will call you blessed , for you shall be a delightful land , ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:3:013:0	“ Your words have been arrogant against Me , ” says the Lord . “ Yet you say , ‘What have we spoken against You ? ’
39:3:014:0	You have said , ‘It is vain to serve God ; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge , and that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts ?
39:3:003:1	The Book of Remembrance
39:3:015:0	So now we call the arrogant blessed ; not only are the doers of wickedness built up but they also test God and escape . ’ ”
39:3:016:0	Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another , and the Lord gave attention and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and who esteem His name .
39:3:017:0	“ They will be Mine , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ on the day that I prepare My own possession , and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him . ”
39:3:018:0	So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked , between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him .
