39:1:001:1	God’s Love for Jacob
39:1:001:0	The oracle of the word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi .
39:1:002:0	“ I have loved you , ” says the Lord . But you say , “ How have You loved us ? ” “ Was not Esau Jacob’s brother ? ” declares the Lord . “ Yet I have loved Jacob ;
39:1:003:0	but I have hated Esau , and I have made his mountains a desolation and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness . ”
39:1:004:0	Though Edom says , “ We have been beaten down , but we will return and build up the ruins ” ; thus says the Lord of hosts , “ They may build , but I will tear down ; and men will call them the wicked territory , and the people toward whom the Lord is indignant forever . ”
39:1:002:1	Sin of the Priests
39:1:005:0	Your eyes will see this and you will say , “ The Lord be magnified beyond the border of Israel ! ”
39:1:006:0	“ ‘A son honors his father , and a servant his master . Then if I am a father , where is My honor ? And if I am a master , where is My respect ? ’ says the Lord of hosts to you , O priests who despise My name . But you say , ‘How have we despised Your name ? ’
39:1:007:0	You are presenting defiled food upon My altar . But you say , ‘How have we defiled You ? ’ In that you say , ‘The table of the Lord is to be despised . ’
39:1:008:0	But when you present the blind for sacrifice , is it not evil ? And when you present the lame and sick , is it not evil ? Why not offer it to your governor ? Would he be pleased with you ? Or would he receive you kindly ? ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:1:009:0	“ But now will you not entreat God’s favor , that He may be gracious to us ? With such an offering on your part , will He receive any of you kindly ? ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:1:010:0	“ Oh that there were one among you who would shut the gates , that you might not uselessly kindle fire on My altar ! I am not pleased with you , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ nor will I accept an offering from you .
39:1:011:0	For from the rising of the sun even to its setting , My name will be great among the nations , and in every place incense is going to be offered to My name , and a grain offering that is pure ; for My name will be great among the nations , ” says the Lord of hosts .
39:1:012:0	“ But you are profaning it , in that you say , ‘The table of the Lord is defiled , and as for its fruit , its food is to be despised . ’
39:1:013:0	You also say , ‘My , how tiresome it is ! ’ And you disdainfully sniff at it , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ and you bring what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick ; so you bring the offering ! Should I receive that from your hand ? ” says the Lord .
39:1:014:0	“ But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it , but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord , for I am a great King , ” says the Lord of hosts , “ and My name is feared among the nations . ”
