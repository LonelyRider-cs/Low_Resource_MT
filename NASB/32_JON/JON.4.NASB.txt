32:4:001:1	Jonah’s Displeasure Rebuked
32:4:001:0	But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry .
32:4:002:0	He prayed to the Lord and said , “ Please Lord , was not this what I said while I was still in my own country ? Therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish , for I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God , slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness , and one who relents concerning calamity .
32:4:003:0	Therefore now , O Lord , please take my life from me , for death is better to me than life . ”
32:4:004:0	The Lord said , “ Do you have good reason to be angry ? ”
32:4:005:0	Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it . There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city .
32:4:006:0	So the Lord God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to deliver him from his discomfort . And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant .
32:4:007:0	But God appointed a worm when dawn came the next day and it attacked the plant and it withered .
32:4:008:0	When the sun came up God appointed a scorching east wind , and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he became faint and begged with all his soul to die , saying , “ Death is better to me than life . ”
32:4:009:0	Then God said to Jonah , “ Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant ? ” And he said , “ I have good reason to be angry , even to death . ”
32:4:010:0	Then the Lord said , “ You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow , which came up overnight and perished overnight .
32:4:011:0	Should I not have compassion on Nineveh , the great city in which there are more than 120 , 000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand , as well as many animals ? ”
