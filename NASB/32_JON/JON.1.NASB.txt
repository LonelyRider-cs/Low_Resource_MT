32:1:001:1	Jonah’s Disobedience
32:1:001:0	The word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying ,
32:1:002:0	“ Arise , go to Nineveh the great city and cry against it , for their wickedness has come up before Me . ”
32:1:003:0	But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord . So he went down to Joppa , found a ship which was going to Tarshish , paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord .
32:1:004:0	The Lord hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up .
32:1:005:0	Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried to his god , and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them . But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship , lain down and fallen sound asleep .
32:1:006:0	So the captain approached him and said , “ How is it that you are sleeping ? Get up , call on your god . Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish . ”
32:1:007:0	Each man said to his mate , “ Come , let us cast lots so we may learn on whose account this calamity has struck us . ” So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah .
32:1:008:0	Then they said to him , “ Tell us , now ! On whose account has this calamity struck us ? What is your occupation ? And where do you come from ? What is your country ? From what people are you ? ”
32:1:009:0	He said to them , “ I am a Hebrew , and I fear the Lord God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land . ”
32:1:010:0	Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him , “ How could you do this ? ” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord , because he had told them .
32:1:011:0	So they said to him , “ What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us ? ” —for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy .
32:1:012:0	He said to them , “ Pick me up and throw me into the sea . Then the sea will become calm for you , for I know that on account of me this great storm has come upon you . ”
32:1:013:0	However , the men rowed desperately to return to land but they could not , for the sea was becoming even stormier against them .
32:1:014:0	Then they called on the Lord and said , “ We earnestly pray , O Lord , do not let us perish on account of this man’s life and do not put innocent blood on us ; for You , O Lord , have done as You have pleased . ”
32:1:015:0	So they picked up Jonah , threw him into the sea , and the sea stopped its raging .
32:1:016:0	Then the men feared the Lord greatly , and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows .
32:1:017:0	And the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah , and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights .
