32:2:001:1	Jonah’s Prayer
32:2:001:0	Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish ,
32:2:002:0	and he said , “ I called out of my distress to the Lord , And He answered me . I cried for help from the depth of Sheol ; You heard my voice .
32:2:003:0	For You had cast me into the deep , Into the heart of the seas , And the current engulfed me . All Your breakers and billows passed over me .
32:2:004:0	So I said , ‘I have been expelled from Your sight . Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple . ’
32:2:005:0	Water encompassed me to the point of death . The great deep engulfed me , Weeds were wrapped around my head .
32:2:006:0	I descended to the roots of the mountains . The earth with its bars was around me forever , But You have brought up my life from the pit , O Lord my God .
32:2:007:0	While I was fainting away , I remembered the Lord , And my prayer came to You , Into Your holy temple .
32:2:008:0	Those who regard vain idolsForsake their faithfulness ,
32:2:009:0	But I will sacrifice to YouWith the voice of thanksgiving . That which I have vowed I will pay . Salvation is from the Lord . ”
32:2:010:0	Then the Lord commanded the fish , and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land .
