38:3:001:1	Joshua , the High Priest
38:3:001:0	Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord , and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him .
38:3:002:0	The Lord said to Satan , “ The Lord rebuke you , Satan ! Indeed , the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you ! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire ? ”
38:3:003:0	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel .
38:3:004:0	He spoke and said to those who were standing before him , saying , “ Remove the filthy garments from him . ” Again he said to him , “ See , I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes . ”
38:3:005:0	Then I said , “ Let them put a clean turban on his head . ” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments , while the angel of the Lord was standing by .
38:3:006:0	And the angel of the Lord admonished Joshua , saying ,
38:3:002:1	The Branch
38:3:007:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service , then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts , and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here .
38:3:008:0	Now listen , Joshua the high priest , you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol , for behold , I am going to bring in My servant the Branch .
38:3:009:0	For behold , the stone that I have set before Joshua ; on one stone are seven eyes . Behold , I will engrave an inscription on it , ’ declares the Lord of hosts , ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day .
38:3:010:0	In that day , ’ declares the Lord of hosts , ‘every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree . ’ ”
