38:8:001:1	The Coming Peace and Prosperity of Zion
38:8:001:0	Then the word of the Lord of hosts came , saying ,
38:8:002:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘I am exceedingly jealous for Zion , yes , with great wrath I am jealous for her . ’
38:8:003:0	Thus says the Lord , ‘I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem . Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth , and the mountain of the Lord of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain . ’
38:8:004:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem , each man with his staff in his hand because of age .
38:8:005:0	And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets . ’
38:8:006:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days , will it also be too difficult in My sight ? ’ declares the Lord of hosts .
38:8:007:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Behold , I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west ;
38:8:008:0	and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem ; and they shall be My people , and I will be their God in truth and righteousness . ’
38:8:009:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Let your hands be strong , you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets , those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid , to the end that the temple might be built .
38:8:010:0	For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal ; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies , and I set all men one against another .
38:8:011:0	But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days , ’ declares the Lord of hosts .
38:8:012:0	‘For there will be peace for the seed : the vine will yield its fruit , the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things .
38:8:013:0	It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations , O house of Judah and house of Israel , so I will save you that you may become a blessing . Do not fear ; let your hands be strong . ’
38:8:014:0	“ For thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath , ’ says the Lord of hosts , ‘and I have not relented ,
38:8:015:0	so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah . Do not fear !
38:8:016:0	These are the things which you should do : speak the truth to one another ; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates .
38:8:017:0	Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another , and do not love perjury ; for all these are what I hate , ’ declares the Lord . ”
38:8:018:0	Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me , saying ,
38:8:019:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘The fast of the fourth , the fast of the fifth , the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy , gladness , and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah ; so love truth and peace . ’
38:8:020:0	“ Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘It will yet be that peoples will come , even the inhabitants of many cities .
38:8:021:0	The inhabitants of one will go to another , saying , “ Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord , and to seek the Lord of hosts ; I will also go . ”
38:8:022:0	So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the Lord . ’
38:8:023:0	Thus says the Lord of hosts , ‘In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew , saying , “ Let us go with you , for we have heard that God is with you . ” ’ ”
