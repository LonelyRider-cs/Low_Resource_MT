38:5:001:1	The Flying Scroll
38:5:001:0	Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked , and behold , there was a flying scroll .
38:5:002:0	And he said to me , “ What do you see ? ” And I answered , “ I see a flying scroll ; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits . ”
38:5:003:0	Then he said to me , “ This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land ; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side , and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side .
38:5:004:0	I will make it go forth , ” declares the Lord of hosts , “ and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name ; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones . ”
38:5:005:0	Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me , “ Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth . ”
38:5:006:0	I said , “ What is it ? ” And he said , “ This is the ephah going forth . ” Again he said , “ This is their appearance in all the land
38:5:007:0	( and behold , a lead cover was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah . ”
38:5:008:0	Then he said , “ This is Wickedness ! ” And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening .
38:5:009:0	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked , and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings ; and they had wings like the wings of a stork , and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens .
38:5:010:0	I said to the angel who was speaking with me , “ Where are they taking the ephah ? ”
38:5:011:0	Then he said to me , “ To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar ; and when it is prepared , she will be set there on her own pedestal . ”
