38:10:001:1	God Will Bless Judah and Ephraim
38:10:001:0	Ask rain from the Lord at the time of the spring rain—The Lord who makes the storm clouds ; And He will give them showers of rain , vegetation in the field to each man .
38:10:002:0	For the teraphim speak iniquity , And the diviners see lying visionsAnd tell false dreams ; They comfort in vain . Therefore the people wander like sheep , They are afflicted , because there is no shepherd .
38:10:003:0	“ My anger is kindled against the shepherds , And I will punish the male goats ; For the Lord of hosts has visited His flock , the house of Judah , And will make them like His majestic horse in battle .
38:10:004:0	From them will come the cornerstone , From them the tent peg , From them the bow of battle , From them every ruler , all of them together .
38:10:005:0	They will be as mighty men , Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle ; And they will fight , for the Lord will be with them ; And the riders on horses will be put to shame .
38:10:006:0	I will strengthen the house of Judah , And I will save the house of Joseph , And I will bring them back , Because I have had compassion on them ; And they will be as though I had not rejected them , For I am the Lord their God and I will answer them .
38:10:007:0	Ephraim will be like a mighty man , And their heart will be glad as if from wine ; Indeed , their children will see it and be glad , Their heart will rejoice in the Lord .
38:10:008:0	I will whistle for them to gather them together , For I have redeemed them ; And they will be as numerous as they were before .
38:10:009:0	When I scatter them among the peoples , They will remember Me in far countries , And they with their children will live and come back .
38:10:010:0	I will bring them back from the land of EgyptAnd gather them from Assyria ; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and LebanonUntil no room can be found for them .
38:10:011:0	And they will pass through the sea of distressAnd He will strike the waves in the sea , So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up ; And the pride of Assyria will be brought downAnd the scepter of Egypt will depart .
38:10:012:0	And I will strengthen them in the Lord , And in His name they will walk , ” declares the Lord .
