38:11:001:1	The Doomed Flock
38:11:001:0	Open your doors , O Lebanon , That a fire may feed on your cedars .
38:11:002:0	Wail , O cypress , for the cedar has fallen , Because the glorious trees have been destroyed ; Wail , O oaks of Bashan , For the impenetrable forest has come down .
38:11:003:0	There is a sound of the shepherds’ wail , For their glory is ruined ; There is a sound of the young lions’ roar , For the pride of the Jordan is ruined .
38:11:004:0	Thus says the Lord my God , “ Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter .
38:11:005:0	Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished , and each of those who sell them says , ‘Blessed be the Lord , for I have become rich ! ’ And their own shepherds have no pity on them .
38:11:006:0	For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land , ” declares the Lord ; “ but behold , I will cause the men to fall , each into another’s power and into the power of his king ; and they will strike the land , and I will not deliver them from their power . ”
38:11:007:0	So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter , hence the afflicted of the flock . And I took for myself two staffs : the one I called Favor and the other I called Union ; so I pastured the flock .
38:11:008:0	Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month , for my soul was impatient with them , and their soul also was weary of me .
38:11:009:0	Then I said , “ I will not pasture you . What is to die , let it die , and what is to be annihilated , let it be annihilated ; and let those who are left eat one another’s flesh . ”
38:11:010:0	I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces , to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples .
38:11:011:0	So it was broken on that day , and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the Lord .
38:11:012:0	I said to them , “ If it is good in your sight , give me my wages ; but if not , never mind ! ” So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages .
38:11:013:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Throw it to the potter , that magnificent price at which I was valued by them . ” So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the Lord .
38:11:014:0	Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union , to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
38:11:015:0	The Lord said to me , “ Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd .
38:11:016:0	For behold , I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing , seek the scattered , heal the broken , or sustain the one standing , but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs .
38:11:017:0	Woe to the worthless shepherdWho leaves the flock ! A sword will be on his armAnd on his right eye ! His arm will be totally witheredAnd his right eye will be blind . ”
