38:1:001:1	A Call to Repentance
38:1:001:0	In the eighth month of the second year of Darius , the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo saying ,
38:1:002:0	“ The Lord was very angry with your fathers .
38:1:003:0	Therefore say to them , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Return to Me , ” declares the Lord of hosts , “ that I may return to you , ” says the Lord of hosts .
38:1:004:0	“ Do not be like your fathers , to whom the former prophets proclaimed , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds . ” ’ But they did not listen or give heed to Me , ” declares the Lord .
38:1:005:0	“ Your fathers , where are they ? And the prophets , do they live forever ?
38:1:002:1	Patrol of the Earth
38:1:006:0	But did not My words and My statutes , which I commanded My servants the prophets , overtake your fathers ? Then they repented and said , ‘As the Lord of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds , so He has dealt with us . ’ ” ’ ”
38:1:007:0	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Shebat , in the second year of Darius , the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , as follows :
38:1:008:0	I saw at night , and behold , a man was riding on a red horse , and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine , with red , sorrel and white horses behind him .
38:1:009:0	Then I said , “ My lord , what are these ? ” And the angel who was speaking with me said to me , “ I will show you what these are . ”
38:1:010:0	And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said , “ These are those whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth . ”
38:1:011:0	So they answered the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees and said , “ We have patrolled the earth , and behold , all the earth is peaceful and quiet . ”
38:1:012:0	Then the angel of the Lord said , “ O Lord of hosts , how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah , with which You have been indignant these seventy years ? ”
38:1:013:0	The Lord answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words , comforting words .
38:1:014:0	So the angel who was speaking with me said to me , “ Proclaim , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion .
38:1:015:0	But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease ; for while I was only a little angry , they furthered the disaster . ”
38:1:016:0	Therefore thus says the Lord , “ I will return to Jerusalem with compassion ; My house will be built in it , ” declares the Lord of hosts , “ and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem . ” ’
38:1:017:0	Again , proclaim , saying , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ My cities will again overflow with prosperity , and the Lord will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem . ” ’ ”
38:1:018:0	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked , and behold , there were four horns .
38:1:019:0	So I said to the angel who was speaking with me , “ What are these ? ” And he answered me , “ These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel and Jerusalem . ”
38:1:020:0	Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen .
38:1:021:0	I said , “ What are these coming to do ? ” And he said , “ These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head ; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them , to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it . ”
