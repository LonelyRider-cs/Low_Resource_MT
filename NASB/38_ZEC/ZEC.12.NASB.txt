38:12:001:1	Jerusalem to Be Attacked
38:12:001:0	The burden of the word of the Lord concerning Israel . T hus declares the Lord who stretches out the heavens , lays the foundation of the earth , and forms the spirit of man within him ,
38:12:002:0	“ Behold , I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around ; and when the siege is against Jerusalem , it will also be against Judah .
38:12:003:0	It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples ; all who lift it will be severely injured . And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it .
38:12:004:0	In that day , ” declares the Lord , “ I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness . But I will watch over the house of Judah , while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness .
38:12:005:0	Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts , ‘A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the Lord of hosts , their God . ’
38:12:006:0	“ In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves , so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples , while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem .
38:12:007:0	The Lord also will save the tents of Judah first , so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah .
38:12:008:0	In that day the Lord will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of the Lord before them .
38:12:009:0	And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
38:12:010:0	“ I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the Spirit of grace and of supplication , so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced ; and they will mourn for Him , as one mourns for an only son , and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn .
38:12:011:0	In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem , like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo .
38:12:012:0	The land will mourn , every family by itself ; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves ; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves ;
38:12:013:0	the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves ; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves ;
38:12:014:0	all the families that remain , every family by itself and their wives by themselves .
