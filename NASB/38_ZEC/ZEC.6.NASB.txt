38:6:001:1	The Four Chariots
38:6:001:0	Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked , and behold , four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains ; and the mountains were bronze mountains .
38:6:002:0	With the first chariot were red horses , with the second chariot black horses ,
38:6:003:0	with the third chariot white horses , and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses .
38:6:004:0	Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me , “ What are these , my lord ? ”
38:6:005:0	The angel replied to me , “ These are the four spirits of heaven , going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth ,
38:6:006:0	with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country ; and the white ones go forth after them , while the dappled ones go forth to the south country .
38:6:007:0	When the strong ones went out , they were eager to go to patrol the earth . ” And He said , “ Go , patrol the earth . ” So they patrolled the earth .
38:6:008:0	Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying , “ See , those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north . ”
38:6:009:0	The word of the Lord also came to me , saying ,
38:6:002:1	The Symbolic Crowns
38:6:010:0	“ Take an offering from the exiles , from Heldai , Tobijah and Jedaiah ; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah , where they have arrived from Babylon .
38:6:011:0	Take silver and gold , make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest .
38:6:012:0	Then say to him , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ Behold , a man whose name is Branch , for He will branch out from where He is ; and He will build the temple of the Lord .
38:6:013:0	Yes , it is He who will build the temple of the Lord , and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne . Thus , He will be a priest on His throne , and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices . ” ’
38:6:014:0	Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the Lord to Helem , Tobijah , Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah .
38:6:015:0	Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the Lord . ” Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you . And it will take place if you completely obey the Lord your God .
