38:9:001:1	Prophecies against Neighboring Nations
38:9:001:0	The burden of the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach , with Damascus as its resting place ( for the eyes of men , especially of all the tribes of Israel , are toward the Lord ) ,
38:9:002:0	And Hamath also , which borders on it ; Tyre and Sidon , though they are very wise .
38:9:003:0	For Tyre built herself a fortressAnd piled up silver like dust , And gold like the mire of the streets .
38:9:004:0	Behold , the Lord will dispossess herAnd cast her wealth into the sea ; And she will be consumed with fire .
38:9:005:0	Ashkelon will see it and be afraid . Gaza too will writhe in great pain ; Also Ekron , for her expectation has been confounded . Moreover , the king will perish from Gaza , And Ashkelon will not be inhabited .
38:9:006:0	And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod , And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
38:9:007:0	And I will remove their blood from their mouthAnd their detestable things from between their teeth . Then they also will be a remnant for our God , And be like a clan in Judah , And Ekron like a Jebusite .
38:9:008:0	But I will camp around My house because of an army , Because of him who passes by and returns ; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore , For now I have seen with My eyes .
38:9:009:0	Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ! Shout in triumph , O daughter of Jerusalem ! Behold , your king is coming to you ; He is just and endowed with salvation , Humble , and mounted on a donkey , Even on a colt , the foal of a donkey .
38:9:002:1	Deliverance of Judah and Ephraim
38:9:010:0	I will cut off the chariot from EphraimAnd the horse from Jerusalem ; And the bow of war will be cut off . And He will speak peace to the nations ; And His dominion will be from sea to sea , And from the River to the ends of the earth .
38:9:011:0	As for you also , because of the blood of My covenant with you , I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit .
38:9:012:0	Return to the stronghold , O prisoners who have the hope ; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you .
38:9:013:0	For I will bend Judah as My bow , I will fill the bow with Ephraim . And I will stir up your sons , O Zion , against your sons , O Greece ; And I will make you like a warriorâ€™s sword .
38:9:014:0	Then the Lord will appear over them , And His arrow will go forth like lightning ; And the Lord God will blow the trumpet , And will march in the storm winds of the south .
38:9:015:0	The Lord of hosts will defend them . And they will devour and trample on the sling stones ; And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine ; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin , Drenched like the corners of the altar .
38:9:016:0	And the Lord their God will save them in that dayAs the flock of His people ; For they are as the stones of a crown , Sparkling in His land .
38:9:017:0	For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs ! Grain will make the young men flourish , and new wine the virgins .
