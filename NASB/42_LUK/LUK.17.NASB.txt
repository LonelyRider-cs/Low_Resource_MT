42:17:001:1	Instructions
42:17:001:0	He said to His disciples , “ It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come , but woe to him through whom they come !
42:17:002:0	It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea , than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble .
42:17:003:0	Be on your guard ! If your brother sins , rebuke him ; and if he repents , forgive him .
42:17:004:0	And if he sins against you seven times a day , and returns to you seven times , saying , ‘I repent , ’ forgive him . ”
42:17:005:0	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
42:17:006:0	And the Lord said , “ If you had faith like a mustard seed , you would say to this mulberry tree , ‘Be uprooted and be planted in the sea’ ; and it would obey you .
42:17:007:0	“ Which of you , having a slave plowing or tending sheep , will say to him when he has come in from the field , ‘Come immediately and sit down to eat’ ?
42:17:008:0	But will he not say to him , ‘Prepare something for me to eat , and clothe yourself and serve me while I eat and drink ; and afterward you may eat and drink’ ?
42:17:009:0	He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded , does he ?
42:17:002:1	Ten Lepers Cleansed
42:17:010:0	So you too , when you do all the things which are commanded you , say , ‘We are unworthy slaves ; we have done that which we ought to have done . ’ ”
42:17:011:0	While He was on the way to Jerusalem , He was passing between Samaria and Galilee .
42:17:012:0	As He entered a village , ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him ;
42:17:013:0	and they raised their voices , saying , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! ”
42:17:014:0	When He saw them , He said to them , “ Go and show yourselves to the priests . ” And as they were going , they were cleansed .
42:17:015:0	Now one of them , when he saw that he had been healed , turned back , glorifying God with a loud voice ,
42:17:016:0	and he fell on his face at His feet , giving thanks to Him . And he was a Samaritan .
42:17:017:0	Then Jesus answered and said , “ Were there not ten cleansed ? But the nine—where are they ?
42:17:018:0	Was no one found who returned to give glory to God , except this foreigner ? ”
42:17:019:0	And He said to him , “ Stand up and go ; your faith has made you well . ”
42:17:020:0	Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming , He answered them and said , “ The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed ;
42:17:003:1	Second Coming Foretold
42:17:021:0	nor will they say , ‘Look , here ’ or , ‘There ’ For behold , the kingdom of God is in your midst . ”
42:17:022:0	And He said to the disciples , “ The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
42:17:023:0	They will say to you , ‘Look there ! Look here ! ’ Do not go away , and do not run after
42:17:024:0	For just like the lightning , when it flashes out of one part of the sky , shines to the other part of the sky , so will the Son of Man be in His day .
42:17:025:0	But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42:17:026:0	And just as it happened in the days of Noah , so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man :
42:17:027:0	they were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were being given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42:17:028:0	It was the same as happened in the days of Lot : they were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building ;
42:17:029:0	but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
42:17:030:0	It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
42:17:031:0	On that day , the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out ; and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back .
42:17:032:0	Remember Lot’s wife .
42:17:033:0	Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it , and whoever loses will preserve it .
42:17:034:0	I tell you , on that night there will be two in one bed ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
42:17:035:0	There will be two women grinding at the same place ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
42:17:036:0	[ Two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other will be left . ” ]
42:17:037:0	And answering they *said to Him , “ Where , Lord ? ” And He said to them , “ Where the body there also the vultures will be gathered . ”
