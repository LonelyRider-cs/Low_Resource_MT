42:22:001:1	Preparing the Passover
42:22:001:0	Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread , which is called the Passover , was approaching .
42:22:002:0	The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death ; for they were afraid of the people .
42:22:003:0	And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot , belonging to the number of the twelve .
42:22:004:0	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them .
42:22:005:0	They were glad and agreed to give him money .
42:22:006:0	So he consented , and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the crowd .
42:22:007:0	Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
42:22:008:0	And Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us , so that we may eat it . ”
42:22:009:0	They said to Him , “ Where do You want us to prepare it ? ”
42:22:010:0	And He said to them , “ When you have entered the city , a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house that he enters .
42:22:011:0	And you shall say to the owner of the house , ‘The Teacher says to you , “ Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
42:22:012:0	And he will show you a large , furnished upper room ; prepare it there . ”
42:22:002:1	The Lord’s Supper
42:22:013:0	And they left and found everything just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
42:22:014:0	When the hour had come , He reclined at the table , and the apostles with Him .
42:22:015:0	And He said to them , “ I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
42:22:016:0	for I say to you , I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . ”
42:22:017:0	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks , He said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves ;
42:22:018:0	for I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes . ”
42:22:019:0	And when He had taken some bread and given thanks , He broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is My body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me . ”
42:22:020:0	And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood .
42:22:021:0	But behold , the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table .
42:22:022:0	For indeed , the Son of Man is going as it has been determined ; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed ! ”
42:22:003:1	Who Is Greatest
42:22:023:0	And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing .
42:22:024:0	And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest .
42:22:025:0	And He said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and those who have authority over them are called ‘Benefactors . ’
42:22:026:0	But not this way with you , but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest , and the leader like the servant .
42:22:027:0	For who is greater , the one who reclines or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines But I am among you as the one who serves .
42:22:028:0	“ You are those who have stood by Me in My trials ;
42:22:029:0	and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom , I grant you
42:22:030:0	that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom , and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42:22:031:0	“ Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat ;
42:22:032:0	but I have prayed for you , that your faith may not fail ; and you , when once you have turned again , strengthen your brothers . ”
42:22:033:0	But he said to Him , “ Lord , with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death ! ”
42:22:034:0	And He said , “ I say to you , Peter , the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me . ”
42:22:035:0	And He said to them , “ When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals , you did not lack anything , did you ? ” They said , “ No , nothing . ”
42:22:036:0	And He said to them , “ But now , whoever has a money belt is to take it along , likewise also a bag , and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one .
42:22:037:0	For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me , ‘A H’ ; for that which refers to Me has fulfillment . ”
42:22:004:1	The Garden of Gethsemane
42:22:038:0	They said , “ Lord , look , here are two swords . ” And He said to them , “ It is enough . ”
42:22:039:0	And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives ; and the disciples also followed Him .
42:22:040:0	When He arrived at the place , He said to them , “ Pray that you may not enter into temptation . ”
42:22:041:0	And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw , and He knelt down and began to pray ,
42:22:042:0	saying , “ Father , if You are willing , remove this cup from Me ; yet not My will , but Yours be done . ”
42:22:043:0	Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him , strengthening Him .
42:22:044:0	And being in agony He was praying very fervently ; and His sweat became like drops of blood , falling down upon the ground .
42:22:045:0	When He rose from prayer , He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow ,
42:22:005:1	Jesus Betrayed by Judas
42:22:046:0	and said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray that you may not enter into temptation . ”
42:22:047:0	While He was still speaking , behold , a crowd came , and the one called Judas , one of the twelve , was preceding them ; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him .
42:22:048:0	But Jesus said to him , “ Judas , are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
42:22:049:0	When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen , they said , “ Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? ”
42:22:050:0	And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42:22:051:0	But Jesus answered and said , “ Stop ! No more of this . ” And He touched his ear and healed him .
42:22:052:0	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber ?
42:22:006:1	Jesus’ Arrest
42:22:053:0	While I was with you daily in the temple , you did not lay hands on Me ; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours . ”
42:22:054:0	Having arrested Him , they led Him away and brought Him to the house of the high priest ; but Peter was following at a distance .
42:22:055:0	After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together , Peter was sitting among them .
42:22:056:0	And a servant-girl , seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him , said , “ This man was with Him too . ”
42:22:057:0	But he denied it , saying , “ Woman , I do not know Him . ”
42:22:058:0	A little later , another saw him and said , “ You are one of them too ! ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
42:22:059:0	After about an hour had passed , another man began to insist , saying , “ Certainly this man also was with Him , for he is a Galilean too . ”
42:22:060:0	But Peter said , “ Man , I do not know what you are talking about . ” Immediately , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42:22:061:0	The Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how He had told him , “ Before a rooster crows today , you will deny Me three times . ”
42:22:062:0	And he went out and wept bitterly .
42:22:063:0	Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him ,
42:22:064:0	and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him , saying , “ Prophesy , who is the one who hit You ? ”
42:22:007:1	Jesus before the Sanhedrin
42:22:065:0	And they were saying many other things against Him , blaspheming .
42:22:066:0	When it was day , the Council of elders of the people assembled , both chief priests and scribes , and they led Him away to their council chamber , saying ,
42:22:067:0	“ If You are the Christ , tell us . ” But He said to them , “ If I tell you , you will not believe ;
42:22:068:0	and if I ask a question , you will not answer .
42:22:069:0	But from now on S M of the power G . ”
42:22:070:0	And they all said , “ Are You the Son of God , then ? ” And He said to them , “ Yes , I am . ”
42:22:071:0	Then they said , “ What further need do we have of testimony ? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth . ”
