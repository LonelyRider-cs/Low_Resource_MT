42:24:001:1	The Resurrection
42:24:001:0	But on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared .
42:24:002:0	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
42:24:003:0	but when they entered , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42:24:004:0	While they were perplexed about this , behold , two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing ;
42:24:005:0	and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground , the men said to them , “ Why do you seek the living One among the dead ?
42:24:006:0	He is not here , but He has risen . Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee ,
42:24:007:0	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again . ”
42:24:008:0	And they remembered His words ,
42:24:009:0	and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
42:24:010:0	Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James ; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles .
42:24:011:0	But these words appeared to them as nonsense , and they would not believe them .
42:24:002:1	The Road to Emmaus
42:24:012:0	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb ; stooping and looking in , he *saw the linen wrappings only ; and he went away to his home , marveling at what had happened .
42:24:013:0	And behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus , which was about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42:24:014:0	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place .
42:24:015:0	While they were talking and discussing , Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them .
42:24:016:0	But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him .
42:24:017:0	And He said to them , “ What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking ? ” And they stood still , looking sad .
42:24:018:0	One of them , named Cleopas , answered and said to Him , “ Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days ? ”
42:24:019:0	And He said to them , “ What things ? ” And they said to Him , “ The things about Jesus the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people ,
42:24:020:0	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death , and crucified Him .
42:24:021:0	But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel . Indeed , besides all this , it is the third day since these things happened .
42:24:022:0	But also some women among us amazed us . When they were at the tomb early in the morning ,
42:24:023:0	and did not find His body , they came , saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive .
42:24:024:0	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said ; but Him they did not see . ”
42:24:025:0	And He said to them , “ O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
42:24:026:0	Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory ? ”
42:24:027:0	Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets , He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures .
42:24:028:0	And they approached the village where they were going , and He acted as though He were going farther .
42:24:029:0	But they urged Him , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is getting toward evening , and the day is now nearly over . ” So He went in to stay with them .
42:24:030:0	When He had reclined at the table with them , He took the bread and blessed it , and breaking it , He began giving it to them .
42:24:031:0	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him ; and He vanished from their sight .
42:24:032:0	They said to one another , “ Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road , while He was explaining the Scriptures to us ? ”
42:24:033:0	And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem , and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them ,
42:24:034:0	saying , “ The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon . ”
42:24:003:1	Other Appearances
42:24:035:0	They began to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
42:24:036:0	While they were telling these things , He Himself stood in their midst and *said to them , “ Peace be to you . ”
42:24:037:0	But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit .
42:24:038:0	And He said to them , “ Why are you troubled , and why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
42:24:039:0	See My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself ; touch Me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have . ”
42:24:040:0	And when He had said this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
42:24:041:0	While they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement , He said to them , “ Have you anything here to eat ? ”
42:24:042:0	They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish ;
42:24:043:0	and He took it and ate it before them .
42:24:044:0	Now He said to them , “ These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you , that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled . ”
42:24:045:0	Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42:24:046:0	and He said to them , “ Thus it is written , that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day ,
42:24:047:0	and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42:24:048:0	You are witnesses of these things .
42:24:004:1	The Ascension
42:24:049:0	And behold , I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you ; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high . ”
42:24:050:0	And He led them out as far as Bethany , and He lifted up His hands and blessed them .
42:24:051:0	While He was blessing them , He parted from them and was carried up into heaven .
42:24:052:0	And they , after worshiping Him , returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42:24:053:0	and were continually in the temple praising God .
