42:23:001:1	Jesus before Pilate
42:23:001:0	Then the whole body of them got up and brought Him before Pilate .
42:23:002:0	And they began to accuse Him , saying , “ We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar , and saying that He Himself is Christ , a King . ”
42:23:003:0	So Pilate asked Him , saying , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” And He answered him and said , “ you say . ”
42:23:004:0	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ I find no guilt in this man . ”
42:23:005:0	But they kept on insisting , saying , “ He stirs up the people , teaching all over Judea , starting from Galilee even as far as this place . ”
42:23:006:0	When Pilate heard it , he asked whether the man was a Galilean .
42:23:002:1	Jesus before Herod
42:23:007:0	And when he learned that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent Him to Herod , who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time .
42:23:008:0	Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus ; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time , because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him .
42:23:009:0	And he questioned Him at some length ; but He answered him nothing .
42:23:010:0	And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there , accusing Him vehemently .
42:23:011:0	And Herod with his soldiers , after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him , dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate .
42:23:003:1	Pilate Seeks Jesus’ Release
42:23:012:0	Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day ; for before they had been enemies with each other .
42:23:013:0	Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
42:23:014:0	and said to them , “ You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion , and behold , having examined Him before you , I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him .
42:23:015:0	No , nor has Herod , for he sent Him back to us ; and behold , nothing deserving death has been done by Him .
42:23:016:0	Therefore I will punish Him and release Him . ”
42:23:017:0	[ Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner . ]
42:23:018:0	But they cried out all together , saying , “ Away with this man , and release for us Barabbas ! ”
42:23:019:0	( He was one who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city , and for murder . )
42:23:020:0	Pilate , wanting to release Jesus , addressed them again ,
42:23:021:0	but they kept on calling out , saying , “ Crucify , crucify Him ! ”
42:23:022:0	And he said to them the third time , “ Why , what evil has this man done ? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death ; therefore I will punish Him and release Him . ”
42:23:023:0	But they were insistent , with loud voices asking that He be crucified . And their voices began to prevail .
42:23:024:0	And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted .
42:23:004:1	Simon Bears the Cross
42:23:025:0	And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , but he delivered Jesus to their will .
42:23:026:0	When they led Him away , they seized a man , Simon of Cyrene , coming in from the country , and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus .
42:23:027:0	And following Him was a large crowd of the people , and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him .
42:23:028:0	But Jesus turning to them said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , stop weeping for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42:23:029:0	For behold , the days are coming when they will say , ‘Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bore , and the breasts that never nursed . ’
42:23:030:0	Then they will begin , ‘F , ’ , ‘C . ’
42:23:031:0	For if they do these things when the tree is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ”
42:23:005:1	The Crucifixion
42:23:032:0	Two others also , who were criminals , were being led away to be put to death with Him .
42:23:033:0	When they came to the place called The Skull , there they crucified Him and the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
42:23:034:0	But Jesus was saying , “ Father , forgive them ; for they do not know what they are doing . ” And they cast lots , dividing up His garments among themselves .
42:23:035:0	And the people stood by , looking on . And even the rulers were sneering at Him , saying , “ He saved others ; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God , His Chosen One . ”
42:23:036:0	The soldiers also mocked Him , coming up to Him , offering Him sour wine ,
42:23:037:0	and saying , “ If You are the King of the Jews , save Yourself ! ”
42:23:038:0	Now there was also an inscription above Him , “ THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . ”
42:23:039:0	One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him , saying , “ Are You not the Christ ? Save Yourself and us ! ”
42:23:040:0	But the other answered , and rebuking him said , “ Do you not even fear God , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ?
42:23:041:0	And we indeed are suffering justly , for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds ; but this man has done nothing wrong . ”
42:23:042:0	And he was saying , “ Jesus , remember me when You come in Your kingdom ! ”
42:23:043:0	And He said to him , “ Truly I say to you , today you shall be with Me in Paradise . ”
42:23:044:0	It was now about the sixth hour , and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour ,
42:23:045:0	because the sun was obscured ; and the veil of the temple was torn in two .
42:23:046:0	And Jesus , crying out with a loud voice , said , “ Father , Y I M . ” Having said this , He breathed His last .
42:23:047:0	Now when the centurion saw what had happened , he began praising God , saying , “ Certainly this man was innocent . ”
42:23:048:0	And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle , when they observed what had happened , began to return , beating their breasts .
42:23:006:1	Jesus Is Buried
42:23:049:0	And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance , seeing these things .
42:23:050:0	And a man named Joseph , who was a member of the Council , a good and righteous man
42:23:051:0	( he had not consented to their plan and action ) , a man from Arimathea , a city of the Jews , who was waiting for the kingdom of God ;
42:23:052:0	this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42:23:053:0	And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock , where no one had ever lain .
42:23:054:0	It was the preparation day , and the Sabbath was about to begin .
42:23:055:0	Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed , and saw the tomb and how His body was laid .
42:23:056:0	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes . And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .
