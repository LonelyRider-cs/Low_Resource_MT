42:20:001:1	Jesus’ Authority Questioned
42:20:001:0	On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted Him ,
42:20:002:0	and they spoke , saying to Him , “ Tell us by what authority You are doing these things , or who is the one who gave You this authority ? ”
42:20:003:0	Jesus answered and said to them , “ I will also ask you a question , and you tell Me :
42:20:004:0	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men ? ”
42:20:005:0	They reasoned among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘Why did you not believe him ? ’
42:20:006:0	But if we say , ‘From men , ’ all the people will stone us to death , for they are convinced that John was a prophet . ”
42:20:007:0	So they answered that they did not know where it came from .
42:20:002:1	Parable of the Vine-growers
42:20:008:0	And Jesus said to them , “ Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
42:20:009:0	And He began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers , and went on a journey for a long time .
42:20:010:0	At the time he sent a slave to the vine-growers , so that they would give him of the produce of the vineyard ; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
42:20:011:0	And he proceeded to send another slave ; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed .
42:20:012:0	And he proceeded to send a third ; and this one also they wounded and cast out .
42:20:013:0	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will respect him . ’
42:20:014:0	But when the vine-growers saw him , they reasoned with one another , saying , ‘This is the heir ; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours . ’
42:20:015:0	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What , then , will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42:20:016:0	He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others . ” When they heard it , they said , “ May it never be ! ”
42:20:017:0	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ What then is this that is written : ‘T , T ’ ?
42:20:003:1	Tribute to Caesar
42:20:018:0	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces ; but on whomever it falls , it will scatter him like dust . ”
42:20:019:0	The scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour , and they feared the people ; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them .
42:20:020:0	So they watched Him , and sent spies who pretended to be righteous , in order that they might catch Him in some statement , so that they could deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor .
42:20:021:0	They questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You speak and teach correctly , and You are not partial to any , but teach the way of God in truth .
42:20:022:0	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
42:20:023:0	But He detected their trickery and said to them ,
42:20:024:0	“ Show Me a denarius . Whose likeness and inscription does it have ? ” They said , “ Caesar’s . ”
42:20:025:0	And He said to them , “ Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
42:20:004:1	Is There a Resurrection ?
42:20:026:0	And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people ; and being amazed at His answer , they became silent .
42:20:027:0	Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees ( who say that there is no resurrection ) ,
42:20:028:0	and they questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies , having a wife , and he is childless , his brother should marry the wife and raise up children to his brother .
42:20:029:0	Now there were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and died childless ;
42:20:030:0	and the second
42:20:031:0	and the third married her ; and in the same way all seven died , leaving no children .
42:20:032:0	Finally the woman died also .
42:20:033:0	In the resurrection therefore , which one’s wife will she be ? For all seven had married her . ”
42:20:034:0	Jesus said to them , “ The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage ,
42:20:035:0	but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
42:20:036:0	for they cannot even die anymore , because they are like angels , and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
42:20:037:0	But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed , in the bush , where he calls the Lord G A , G I , G J .
42:20:038:0	Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living ; for all live to Him . ”
42:20:039:0	Some of the scribes answered and said , “ Teacher , You have spoken well . ”
42:20:040:0	For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything .
42:20:041:0	Then He said to them , “ How they say the Christ is David’s son ?
42:20:042:0	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘T L L , “ S M ,
42:20:043:0	U I Y Y . ” ’
42:20:044:0	Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord , ’ and how is He his son ? ”
42:20:045:0	And while all the people were listening , He said to the disciples ,
42:20:046:0	“ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes , and love respectful greetings in the market places , and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets ,
42:20:047:0	who devour widows’ houses , and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers . These will receive greater condemnation . ”
