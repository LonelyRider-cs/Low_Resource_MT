42:8:001:1	Ministering Women
42:8:001:0	Soon afterwards , He began going around from one city and village to another , proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God . The twelve were with Him ,
42:8:002:0	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses : Mary who was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
42:8:002:1	Parable of the Sower
42:8:003:0	and Joanna the wife of Chuza , Herod’s steward , and Susanna , and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means .
42:8:004:0	When a large crowd was coming together , and those from the various cities were journeying to Him , He spoke by way of a parable :
42:8:005:0	“ The sower went out to sow his seed ; and as he sowed , some fell beside the road , and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up .
42:8:006:0	Other fell on rocky and as soon as it grew up , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
42:8:007:0	Other fell among the thorns ; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out .
42:8:008:0	Other fell into the good soil , and grew up , and produced a crop a hundred times as great . ” As He said these things , He would call out , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42:8:009:0	His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant .
42:8:010:0	And He said , “ To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest in parables , so that , .
42:8:011:0	“ Now the parable is this : the seed is the word of God .
42:8:012:0	Those beside the road are those who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart , so that they will not believe and be saved .
42:8:013:0	Those on the rocky those who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root ; they believe for a while , and in time of temptation fall away .
42:8:014:0	The which fell among the thorns , these are the ones who have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
42:8:003:1	Parable of the Lamp
42:8:015:0	But the in the good soil , these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart , and hold it fast , and bear fruit with perseverance .
42:8:016:0	“ Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container , or puts it under a bed ; but he puts it on a lampstand , so that those who come in may see the light .
42:8:017:0	For nothing is hidden that will not become evident , nor secret that will not be known and come to light .
42:8:018:0	So take care how you listen ; for whoever has , to him shall be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him . ”
42:8:019:0	And His mother and brothers came to Him , and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd .
42:8:020:0	And it was reported to Him , “ Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , wishing to see You . ”
42:8:004:1	Jesus Stills the Sea
42:8:021:0	But He answered and said to them , “ My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it . ”
42:8:022:0	Now on one of those days Jesus and His disciples got into a boat , and He said to them , “ Let us go over to the other side of the lake . ” So they launched out .
42:8:023:0	But as they were sailing along He fell asleep ; and a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake , and they began to be swamped and to be in danger .
42:8:024:0	They came to Jesus and woke Him up , saying , “ Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And He got up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves , and they stopped , and it became calm .
42:8:005:1	The Demoniac Cured
42:8:025:0	And He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” They were fearful and amazed , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey Him ? ”
42:8:026:0	Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42:8:027:0	And when He came out onto the land , He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons ; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time , and was not living in a house , but in the tombs .
42:8:028:0	Seeing Jesus , he cried out and fell before Him , and said in a loud voice , “ What business do we have with each other , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg You , do not torment me . ”
42:8:029:0	For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For it had seized him many times ; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard , and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert .
42:8:030:0	And Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Legion ” ; for many demons had entered him .
42:8:031:0	They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into the abyss .
42:8:032:0	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain ; and the demons implored Him to permit them to enter the swine . And He gave them permission .
42:8:033:0	And the demons came out of the man and entered the swine ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned .
42:8:034:0	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and reported it in the city and out in the country .
42:8:035:0	The people went out to see what had happened ; and they came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting down at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind ; and they became frightened .
42:8:036:0	Those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well .
42:8:037:0	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them , for they were gripped with great fear ; and He got into a boat and returned .
42:8:038:0	But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him ; but He sent him away , saying ,
42:8:006:1	Miracles of Healing
42:8:039:0	“ Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you . ” So he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him .
42:8:040:0	And as Jesus returned , the people welcomed Him , for they had all been waiting for Him .
42:8:041:0	And there came a man named Jairus , and he was an official of the synagogue ; and he fell at Jesus’ feet , and began to implore Him to come to his house ;
42:8:042:0	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . But as He went , the crowds were pressing against Him .
42:8:043:0	And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years , and could not be healed by anyone ,
42:8:044:0	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak , and immediately her hemorrhage stopped .
42:8:045:0	And Jesus said , “ Who is the one who touched Me ? ” And while they were all denying it , Peter said , “ Master , the people are crowding and pressing in on You . ”
42:8:046:0	But Jesus said , “ Someone did touch Me , for I was aware that power had gone out of Me . ”
42:8:047:0	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice , she came trembling and fell down before Him , and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him , and how she had been immediately healed .
42:8:048:0	And He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace . ”
42:8:049:0	While He was still speaking , someone *came from the house of the synagogue official , saying , “ Your daughter has died ; do not trouble the Teacher anymore . ”
42:8:050:0	But when Jesus heard this , He answered him , “ Do not be afraid only believe , and she will be made well . ”
42:8:051:0	When He came to the house , He did not allow anyone to enter with Him , except Peter and John and James , and the girl’s father and mother .
42:8:052:0	Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her ; but He said , “ Stop weeping , for she has not died , but is asleep . ”
42:8:053:0	And they began laughing at Him , knowing that she had died .
42:8:054:0	He , however , took her by the hand and called , saying , “ Child , arise ! ”
42:8:055:0	And her spirit returned , and she got up immediately ; and He gave orders for something to be given her to eat .
42:8:056:0	Her parents were amazed ; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened .
