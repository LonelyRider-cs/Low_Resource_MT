42:19:001:1	Zaccheus Converted
42:19:001:0	He entered Jericho and was passing through .
42:19:002:0	And there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus ; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich .
42:19:003:0	Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was , and was unable because of the crowd , for he was small in stature .
42:19:004:0	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him , for He was about to pass through that way .
42:19:005:0	When Jesus came to the place , He looked up and said to him , “ Zaccheus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . ”
42:19:006:0	And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly .
42:19:007:0	When they saw it , they all began to grumble , saying , “ He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner . ”
42:19:008:0	Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord , “ Behold , Lord , half of my possessions I will give to the poor , and if I have defrauded anyone of anything , I will give back four times as much . ”
42:19:009:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , because he , too , is a son of Abraham .
42:19:002:1	Parable of Money Usage
42:19:010:0	For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost . ”
42:19:011:0	While they were listening to these things , Jesus went on to tell a parable , because He was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately .
42:19:012:0	So He said , “ A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself , and return .
42:19:013:0	And he called ten of his slaves , and gave them ten minas and said to them , ‘Do business until I come ’
42:19:014:0	But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘We do not want this man to reign over us . ’
42:19:015:0	When he returned , after receiving the kingdom , he ordered that these slaves , to whom he had given the money , be called to him so that he might know what business they had done .
42:19:016:0	The first appeared , saying , ‘Master , your mina has made ten minas more . ’
42:19:017:0	And he said to him , ‘Well done , good slave , because you have been faithful in a very little thing , you are to be in authority over ten cities . ’
42:19:018:0	The second came , saying , ‘Your mina , master , has made five minas . ’
42:19:019:0	And he said to him also , ‘And you are to be over five cities . ’
42:19:020:0	Another came , saying , ‘Master , here is your mina , which I kept put away in a handkerchief ;
42:19:021:0	for I was afraid of you , because you are an exacting man ; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow . ’
42:19:022:0	He *said to him , ‘By your own words I will judge you , you worthless slave . Did you know that I am an exacting man , taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow ?
42:19:023:0	Then why did you not put my money in the bank , and having come , I would have collected it with interest ? ’
42:19:024:0	Then he said to the bystanders , ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas . ’
42:19:025:0	And they said to him , ‘Master , he has ten minas ’
42:19:026:0	‘I tell you that to everyone who has , more shall be given , but from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .
42:19:003:1	Triumphal Entry
42:19:027:0	But these enemies of mine , who did not want me to reign over them , bring them here and slay them in my presence . ’ ”
42:19:028:0	After He had said these things , He was going on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
42:19:029:0	When He approached Bethphage and Bethany , near the mount that is called Olivet , He sent two of the disciples ,
42:19:030:0	saying , “ Go into the village ahead of there , as you enter , you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat ; untie it and bring it
42:19:031:0	If anyone asks you , ‘Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say , ‘The Lord has need of it . ’ ”
42:19:032:0	So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them .
42:19:033:0	As they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
42:19:034:0	They said , “ The Lord has need of it . ”
42:19:035:0	They brought it to Jesus , and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it .
42:19:036:0	As He was going , they were spreading their coats on the road .
42:19:037:0	As soon as He was approaching , near the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen ,
42:19:038:0	shouting : “ Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
42:19:039:0	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , rebuke Your disciples . ”
42:19:040:0	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you , if these become silent , the stones will cry out ! ”
42:19:041:0	When He approached Jerusalem , He saw the city and wept over it ,
42:19:042:0	saying , “ If you had known in this day , even you , the things which make for peace ! But now they have been hidden from your eyes .
42:19:043:0	For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you , and surround you and hem you in on every side ,
42:19:004:1	Traders Driven from the Temple
42:19:044:0	and they will level you to the ground and your children within you , and they will not leave in you one stone upon another , because you did not recognize the time of your visitation . ”
42:19:045:0	Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling ,
42:19:046:0	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘A M , ’ but you have made it a ’ . ”
42:19:047:0	And He was teaching daily in the temple ; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him ,
42:19:048:0	and they could not find anything that they might do , for all the people were hanging on to every word He said .
