42:18:001:1	Parables on Prayer
42:18:001:0	Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart ,
42:18:002:0	saying , “ In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man .
42:18:003:0	There was a widow in that city , and she kept coming to him , saying , ‘Give me legal protection from my opponent . ’
42:18:004:0	For a while he was unwilling ; but afterward he said to himself , ‘Even though I do not fear God nor respect man ,
42:18:005:0	yet because this widow bothers me , I will give her legal protection , otherwise by continually coming she will wear me out . ’ ”
42:18:006:0	And the Lord said , “ Hear what the unrighteous judge *said ;
42:18:007:0	now , will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night , and will He delay long over them ?
42:18:002:1	The Pharisee and the Publican
42:18:008:0	I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly . However , when the Son of Man comes , will He find faith on the earth ? ”
42:18:009:0	And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and viewed others with contempt :
42:18:010:0	“ Two men went up into the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42:18:011:0	The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself : ‘God , I thank You that I am not like other people : swindlers , unjust , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
42:18:012:0	I fast twice a week ; I pay tithes of all that I get . ’
42:18:013:0	But the tax collector , standing some distance away , was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven , but was beating his breast , saying , ‘God , be merciful to me , the sinner ! ’
42:18:014:0	I tell you , this man went to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42:18:015:0	And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them , but when the disciples saw it , they began rebuking them .
42:18:016:0	But Jesus called for them , saying , “ Permit the children to come to Me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
42:18:003:1	The Rich Young Ruler
42:18:017:0	Truly I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it ”
42:18:018:0	A ruler questioned Him , saying , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
42:18:019:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except God alone .
42:18:020:0	You know the commandments , ‘D , D , D , D , H . ’ ”
42:18:021:0	And he said , “ All these things I have kept from my youth . ”
42:18:022:0	When Jesus heard this , He said to him , “ One thing you still lack ; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor , and you shall have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me . ”
42:18:023:0	But when he had heard these things , he became very sad , for he was extremely rich .
42:18:024:0	And Jesus looked at him and said , “ How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God !
42:18:025:0	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
42:18:026:0	They who heard it said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
42:18:027:0	But He said , “ The things that are impossible with people are possible with God . ”
42:18:028:0	Peter said , “ Behold , we have left our own homes and followed You . ”
42:18:029:0	And He said to them , “ Truly I say to you , there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
42:18:030:0	who will not receive many times as much at this time and in the age to come , eternal life . ”
42:18:031:0	Then He took the twelve aside and said to them , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished .
42:18:032:0	For He will be handed over to the Gentiles , and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon ,
42:18:033:0	and after they have scourged Him , they will kill Him ; and the third day He will rise again . ”
42:18:004:1	Bartimaeus Receives Sight
42:18:034:0	But the disciples understood none of these things , and the meaning of this statement was hidden from them , and they did not comprehend the things that were said .
42:18:035:0	As Jesus was approaching Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the road begging .
42:18:036:0	Now hearing a crowd going by , he began to inquire what this was .
42:18:037:0	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
42:18:038:0	And he called out , saying , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42:18:039:0	Those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet ; but he kept crying out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42:18:040:0	And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him ; and when he came near , He questioned him ,
42:18:041:0	“ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” And he said , “ Lord , I want to regain my sight ! ”
42:18:042:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Receive your sight ; your faith has made you well . ”
42:18:043:0	Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him , glorifying God ; and when all the people saw it , they gave praise to God .
