42:14:001:1	Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
42:14:001:0	It happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread , they were watching Him closely .
42:14:002:0	And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy .
42:14:003:0	And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? ”
42:14:004:0	But they kept silent . And He took hold of him and healed him , and sent him away .
42:14:005:0	And He said to them , “ Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well , and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? ”
42:14:002:1	Parable of the Guests
42:14:006:0	And they could make no reply to this .
42:14:007:0	And He began speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honor at the table , saying to them ,
42:14:008:0	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , do not take the place of honor , for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him ,
42:14:009:0	and he who invited you both will come and say to you , ‘Give place to this man , ’ and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place .
42:14:010:0	But when you are invited , go and recline at the last place , so that when the one who has invited you comes , he may say to you , ‘Friend , move up higher’ ; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you .
42:14:011:0	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42:14:012:0	And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him , “ When you give a luncheon or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors , otherwise they may also invite you in return and will be your repayment .
42:14:013:0	But when you give a reception , invite poor , crippled , lame , blind ,
42:14:014:0	and you will be blessed , since they do not have to repay you ; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous . ”
42:14:003:1	Parable of the Dinner
42:14:015:0	When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this , he said to Him , “ Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ”
42:14:016:0	But He said to him , “ A man was giving a big dinner , and he invited many ;
42:14:017:0	and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited , ‘Come ; for everything is ready now . ’
42:14:018:0	But they all alike began to make excuses . The first one said to him , ‘I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it ; please consider me excused . ’
42:14:019:0	Another one said , ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to try them out ; please consider me excused . ’
42:14:020:0	Another one said , ‘I have married a wife , and for that reason I cannot come . ’
42:14:021:0	And the slave came and reported this to his master . Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave , ‘Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame . ’
42:14:022:0	And the slave said , ‘Master , what you commanded has been done , and still there is room . ’
42:14:023:0	And the master said to the slave , ‘Go out into the highways and along the hedges , and compel to come in , so that my house may be filled .
42:14:004:1	Discipleship Tested
42:14:024:0	For I tell you , none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner . ’ ”
42:14:025:0	Now large crowds were going along with Him ; and He turned and said to them ,
42:14:026:0	“ If anyone comes to Me , and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , yes , and even his own life , he cannot be My disciple .
42:14:027:0	Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple .
42:14:028:0	For which one of you , when he wants to build a tower , does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it ?
42:14:029:0	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish , all who observe it begin to ridicule him ,
42:14:030:0	saying , ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish . ’
42:14:031:0	Or what king , when he sets out to meet another king in battle , will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
42:14:032:0	Or else , while the other is still far away , he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace .
42:14:033:0	So then , none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions .
42:14:034:0	“ Therefore , salt is good ; but if even salt has become tasteless , with what will it be seasoned ?
42:14:035:0	It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile ; it is thrown out . He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
