42:12:001:1	God Knows and Cares
42:12:001:0	Under these circumstances , after so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another , He began saying to His disciples first of all , “ Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42:12:002:0	But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed , and hidden that will not be known .
42:12:003:0	Accordingly , whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops .
42:12:004:0	“ I say to you , My friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do .
42:12:005:0	But I will warn you whom to fear : fear the One who , after He has killed , has authority to cast into hell ; yes , I tell you , fear Him !
42:12:006:0	Are not five sparrows sold for two cents ? not one of them is forgotten before God .
42:12:007:0	Indeed , the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Do not fear ; you are more valuable than many sparrows .
42:12:008:0	“ And I say to you , everyone who confesses Me before men , the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God ;
42:12:009:0	but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God .
42:12:010:0	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him .
42:12:011:0	When they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities , do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense , or what you are to say ;
42:12:002:1	Covetousness Denounced
42:12:012:0	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say . ”
42:12:013:0	Someone in the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me . ”
42:12:014:0	But He said to him , “ Man , who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
42:12:015:0	Then He said to them , “ Beware , and be on your guard against every form of greed ; for not when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions . ”
42:12:016:0	And He told them a parable , saying , “ The land of a rich man was very productive .
42:12:017:0	And he began reasoning to himself , saying , ‘What shall I do , since I have no place to store my crops ? ’
42:12:018:0	Then he said , ‘This is what I will do : I will tear down my barns and build larger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
42:12:019:0	And I will say to my soul , “ Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years take your ease , eat , drink be merry . ” ’
42:12:020:0	But God said to him , ‘You fool ! This night your soul is required of you ; and who will own what you have prepared ? ’
42:12:021:0	So is the man who stores up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . ”
42:12:022:0	And He said to His disciples , “ For this reason I say to you , do not worry about life , what you will eat ; nor for your body , what you will put on .
42:12:023:0	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothing .
42:12:024:0	Consider the ravens , for they neither sow nor reap ; they have no storeroom nor barn , and God feeds them ; how much more valuable you are than the birds !
42:12:025:0	And which of you by worrying can add a hour to his life’s span ?
42:12:026:0	If then you cannot do even a very little thing , why do you worry about other matters ?
42:12:027:0	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they neither toil nor spin ; but I tell you , not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
42:12:028:0	But if God so clothes the grass in the field , which is today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more you ? You men of little faith !
42:12:029:0	And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink , and do not keep worrying .
42:12:030:0	For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek ; but your Father knows that you need these things .
42:12:031:0	But seek His kingdom , and these things will be added to you .
42:12:032:0	Do not be afraid , little flock , for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom .
42:12:033:0	“ Sell your possessions and give to charity ; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out , an unfailing treasure in heaven , where no thief comes near nor moth destroys .
42:12:003:1	Be in Readiness
42:12:034:0	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
42:12:035:0	“ Be dressed in readiness , and your lamps lit .
42:12:036:0	Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast , so that they may immediately open to him when he comes and knocks .
42:12:037:0	Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes ; truly I say to you , that he will gird himself and have them recline and will come up and wait on them .
42:12:038:0	Whether he comes in the second watch , or even in the third , and finds so , blessed are those
42:12:039:0	“ But be sure of this , that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
42:12:040:0	You too , be ready ; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect . ”
42:12:041:0	Peter said , “ Lord , are You addressing this parable to us , or to everyone else as well ? ”
42:12:042:0	And the Lord said , “ Who then is the faithful and sensible steward , whom his master will put in charge of his servants , to give them their rations at the proper time ?
42:12:043:0	Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes .
42:12:044:0	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
42:12:045:0	But if that slave says in his heart , ‘My master will be a long time in coming , ’ and begins to beat the slaves , men and women , and to eat and drink and get drunk ;
42:12:046:0	the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect and at an hour he does not know , and will cut him in pieces , and assign him a place with the unbelievers .
42:12:047:0	And that slave who knew his master’s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will , will receive many lashes ,
42:12:004:1	Christ Divides Men
42:12:048:0	but the one who did not know and committed deeds worthy of a flogging , will receive but few . From everyone who has been given much , much will be required ; and to whom they entrusted much , of him they will ask all the more .
42:12:049:0	“ I have come to cast fire upon the earth ; and how I wish it were already kindled !
42:12:050:0	But I have a baptism to undergo , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
42:12:051:0	Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth ? I tell you , no , but rather division ;
42:12:052:0	for from now on five in one household will be divided , three against two and two against three .
42:12:053:0	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . ”
42:12:054:0	And He was also saying to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising in the west , immediately you say , ‘A shower is coming , ’ and so it turns out .
42:12:055:0	And when a south wind blowing , you say , ‘It will be a hot day , ’ and it turns out
42:12:056:0	You hypocrites ! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky , but why do you not analyze this present time ?
42:12:057:0	“ And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right ?
42:12:058:0	For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate , on way make an effort to settle with him , so that he may not drag you before the judge , and the judge turn you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
42:12:059:0	I say to you , you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent . ”
