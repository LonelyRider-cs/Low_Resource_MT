42:11:001:1	Instruction about Prayer
42:11:001:0	It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place , after He had finished , one of His disciples said to Him , “ Lord , teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples . ”
42:11:002:0	And He said to them , “ When you pray , say : ‘ Father , hallowed be Your name . Your kingdom come .
42:11:003:0	Give us each day our daily bread .
42:11:004:0	And forgive us our sins , For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation . ’ ”
42:11:005:0	Then He said to them , “ Suppose one of you has a friend , and goes to him at midnight and says to him , ‘Friend , lend me three loaves ;
42:11:006:0	for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey , and I have nothing to set before him’ ;
42:11:007:0	and from inside he answers and says , ‘Do not bother me ; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed ; I cannot get up and give you ’
42:11:008:0	I tell you , even though he will not get up and give him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
42:11:009:0	“ So I say to you , ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
42:11:010:0	For everyone who asks , receives ; and he who seeks , finds ; and to him who knocks , it will be opened .
42:11:011:0	Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish ; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish , will he ?
42:11:012:0	Or he is asked for an egg , he will not give him a scorpion , will he ?
42:11:002:1	Pharisees’ Blasphemy
42:11:013:0	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him ? ”
42:11:014:0	And He was casting out a demon , and it was mute ; when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the crowds were amazed .
42:11:015:0	But some of them said , “ He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons . ”
42:11:016:0	Others , to test Him , were demanding of Him a sign from heaven .
42:11:017:0	But He knew their thoughts and said to them , “ Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste ; and a house against itself falls .
42:11:018:0	If Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
42:11:019:0	And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? So they will be your judges .
42:11:020:0	But if I cast out demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
42:11:021:0	When a strong fully armed , guards his own house , his possessions are undisturbed .
42:11:022:0	But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him , he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder .
42:11:023:0	He who is not with Me is against Me ; and he who does not gather with Me , scatters .
42:11:024:0	“ When the unclean spirit goes out of a man , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , and not finding any , it says , ‘I will return to my house from which I came . ’
42:11:025:0	And when it comes , it finds it swept and put in order .
42:11:026:0	Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and live there ; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . ”
42:11:027:0	While Jesus was saying these things , one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed . ”
42:11:003:1	The Sign of Jonah
42:11:028:0	But He said , “ On the contrary , blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it . ”
42:11:029:0	As the crowds were increasing , He began to say , “ This generation is a wicked generation ; it seeks for a sign , and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah .
42:11:030:0	For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .
42:11:031:0	The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
42:11:032:0	The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it , because they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , something greater than Jonah is here .
42:11:033:0	“ No one , after lighting a lamp , puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket , but on the lampstand , so that those who enter may see the light .
42:11:034:0	The eye is the lamp of your body ; when your eye is clear , your whole body also is full of light ; but when it is bad , your body also is full of darkness .
42:11:035:0	Then watch out that the light in you is not darkness .
42:11:004:1	Woes upon the Pharisees
42:11:036:0	If therefore your whole body is full of light , with no dark part in it , it will be wholly illumined , as when the lamp illumines you with its rays . ”
42:11:037:0	Now when He had spoken , a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him ; and He went in , and reclined at the table .
42:11:038:0	When the Pharisee saw it , he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal .
42:11:039:0	But the Lord said to him , “ Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter ; but inside of you , you are full of robbery and wickedness .
42:11:040:0	You foolish ones , did not He who made the outside make the inside also ?
42:11:041:0	But give that which is within as charity , and then all things are clean for you .
42:11:042:0	“ But woe to you Pharisees ! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every garden herb , and disregard justice and the love of God ; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others .
42:11:043:0	Woe to you Pharisees ! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the market places .
42:11:044:0	Woe to you ! For you are like concealed tombs , and the people who walk over are unaware ”
42:11:045:0	One of the lawyers *said to Him in reply , “ Teacher , when You say this , You insult us too . ”
42:11:046:0	But He said , “ Woe to you lawyers as well ! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear , while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42:11:047:0	Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
42:11:048:0	So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers ; because it was they who killed them , and you build
42:11:049:0	For this reason also the wisdom of God said , ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles , and of them they will kill and they will persecute ,
42:11:050:0	so that the blood of all the prophets , shed since the foundation of the world , may be charged against this generation ,
42:11:051:0	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the house yes , I tell you , it shall be charged against this generation . ’
42:11:052:0	Woe to you lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge ; you yourselves did not enter , and you hindered those who were entering . ”
42:11:053:0	When He left there , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects ,
42:11:054:0	plotting against Him to catch Him in something He might say .
