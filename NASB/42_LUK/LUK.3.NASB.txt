42:3:001:1	John the Baptist Preaches
42:3:001:0	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene ,
42:3:002:0	in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness .
42:3:003:0	And he came into all the district around the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins ;
42:3:004:0	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘Make ready the way of the Lord , Make His paths straight .
42:3:005:0	Every ravine will be filled , And every mountain and hill will be brought low ; The crooked will become straight , And the rough roads smooth ;
42:3:006:0	And all flesh will see the salvation of God . ’ ”
42:3:007:0	So he began saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him , “ You brood of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42:3:008:0	Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance , and do not begin to say to yourselves , ‘We have Abraham for our father , ’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham .
42:3:009:0	Indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees ; so every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
42:3:010:0	And the crowds were questioning him , saying , “ Then what shall we do ? ”
42:3:011:0	And he would answer and say to them , “ The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none ; and he who has food is to do likewise . ”
42:3:012:0	And some tax collectors also came to be baptized , and they said to him , “ Teacher , what shall we do ? ”
42:3:013:0	And he said to them , “ Collect no more than what you have been ordered to . ”
42:3:014:0	Some soldiers were questioning him , saying , “ And what about us , what shall we do ? ” And he said to them , “ Do not take money from anyone by force , or accuse anyone falsely , and be content with your wages . ”
42:3:015:0	Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John , as to whether he was the Christ ,
42:3:016:0	John answered and said to them all , “ As for me , I baptize you with water ; but One is coming who is mightier than I , and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals ; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
42:3:017:0	His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor , and to gather the wheat into His barn ; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire . ”
42:3:018:0	So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to the people .
42:3:019:0	But when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias , his brother’s wife , and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done ,
42:3:002:1	Jesus Is Baptized
42:3:020:0	Herod also added this to them all : he locked John up in prison .
42:3:021:0	Now when all the people were baptized , Jesus was also baptized , and while He was praying , heaven was opened ,

42:3:022:0	and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove , and a voice came out of heaven , “ You are My beloved Son , in You I am well-pleased . ”
42:3:023:0	When He began His ministry , Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age , being , as was supposed , the son of Joseph , the son of Eli ,
42:3:024:0	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
