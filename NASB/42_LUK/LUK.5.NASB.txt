42:5:001:1	The First Disciples
42:5:001:0	Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God , He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret ;
42:5:002:0	and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake ; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets .
42:5:003:0	And He got into one of the boats , which was Simon’s , and asked him to put out a little way from the land . And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat .
42:5:004:0	When He had finished speaking , He said to Simon , “ Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch . ”
42:5:005:0	Simon answered and said , “ Master , we worked hard all night and caught nothing , but I will do as You say and let down the nets . ”
42:5:006:0	When they had done this , they enclosed a great quantity of fish , and their nets began to break ;
42:5:007:0	so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them . And they came and filled both of the boats , so that they began to sink .
42:5:008:0	But when Simon Peter saw that , he fell down at Jesus’ feet , saying , “ Go away from me Lord , for I am a sinful man ! ”
42:5:009:0	For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken ;
42:5:010:0	and so also were James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , “ Do not fear , from now on you will be catching men . ”
42:5:002:1	The Leper and the Paralytic
42:5:011:0	When they had brought their boats to land , they left everything and followed Him .
42:5:012:0	While He was in one of the cities , behold , there was a man covered with leprosy ; and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and implored Him , saying , “ Lord , if You are willing , You can make me clean . ”
42:5:013:0	And He stretched out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be cleansed . ” And immediately the leprosy left him .
42:5:014:0	And He ordered him to tell no one , “ But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing , just as Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
42:5:015:0	But the news about Him was spreading even farther , and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses .
42:5:016:0	But Jesus Himself would often slip away to the wilderness and pray .
42:5:017:0	One day He was teaching ; and there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there , who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem ; and the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing .
42:5:018:0	And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed ; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him .
42:5:019:0	But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher , into the middle of the crowd , in front of Jesus .
42:5:020:0	Seeing their faith , He said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven you . ”
42:5:021:0	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , “ Who is this man who speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? ”
42:5:022:0	But Jesus , aware of their reasonings , answered and said to them , “ Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
42:5:023:0	Which is easier , to say , ‘Your sins have been forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘Get up and walk’ ?
42:5:024:0	But , so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” —He said to the paralytic— “ I say to you , get up , and pick up your stretcher and go home . ”
42:5:025:0	Immediately he got up before them , and picked up what he had been lying on , and went home glorifying God .
42:5:003:1	Call of Levi ( Matthew )
42:5:026:0	They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God ; and they were filled with fear , saying , “ We have seen remarkable things today . ”
42:5:027:0	After that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth , and He said to him , “ Follow Me . ”
42:5:028:0	And he left everything behind , and got up and began to follow Him .
42:5:029:0	And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house ; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them .
42:5:030:0	The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42:5:031:0	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ not those who are well who need a physician , but those who are sick .
42:5:032:0	I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance . ”
42:5:033:0	And they said to Him , “ The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers , the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same , but Yours eat and drink . ”
42:5:034:0	And Jesus said to them , “ You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them , can you ?
42:5:035:0	But days will come ; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them , then they will fast in those days . ”
42:5:036:0	And He was also telling them a parable : “ No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment ; otherwise he will both tear the new , and the piece from the new will not match the old .
42:5:037:0	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out , and the skins will be ruined .
42:5:038:0	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
42:5:039:0	And no one , after drinking old wishes for new ; for he says , ‘The old is good ’ ”
