42:6:001:1	Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath
42:6:001:0	Now it happened that He was passing through some grainfields on a Sabbath ; and His disciples were picking the heads of grain , rubbing them in their hands , and eating the grain .
42:6:002:0	But some of the Pharisees said , “ Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? ”
42:6:003:0	And Jesus answering them said , “ Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him ,
42:6:004:0	how he entered the house of God , and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone , and gave it to his companions ? ”
42:6:005:0	And He was saying to them , “ The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . ”
42:6:006:0	On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching ; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered .
42:6:007:0	The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath , so that they might find reason to accuse Him .
42:6:008:0	But He knew what they were thinking , and He said to the man with the withered hand , “ Get up and come forward ! ” And he got up and came forward .
42:6:009:0	And Jesus said to them , “ I ask you , is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath , to save a life or to destroy it ? ”
42:6:010:0	After looking around at them all , He said to him , “ Stretch out your hand ! ” And he did so ; and his hand was restored .
42:6:002:1	Choosing the Twelve
42:6:011:0	But they themselves were filled with rage , and discussed together what they might do to Jesus .
42:6:012:0	It was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray , and He spent the whole night in prayer to God .
42:6:013:0	And when day came , He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them , whom He also named as apostles :
42:6:014:0	Simon , whom He also named Peter , and Andrew his brother ; and James and John ; and Philip and Bartholomew ;
42:6:015:0	and Matthew and Thomas ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot ;
42:6:016:0	Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
42:6:017:0	Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place ; and there was a large crowd of His disciples , and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon ,
42:6:018:0	who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases ; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured .
42:6:003:1	The Beatitudes
42:6:019:0	And all the people were trying to touch Him , for power was coming from Him and healing them all .
42:6:020:0	And turning His gaze toward His disciples , He began to say , “ Blessed you poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
42:6:021:0	Blessed you who hunger now , for you shall be satisfied . Blessed you who weep now , for you shall laugh .
42:6:022:0	Blessed are you when men hate you , and ostracize you , and insult you , and scorn your name as evil , for the sake of the Son of Man .
42:6:023:0	Be glad in that day and leap for behold , your reward is great in heaven . For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets .
42:6:024:0	But woe to you who are rich , for you are receiving your comfort in full .
42:6:025:0	Woe to you who are well-fed now , for you shall be hungry . Woe who laugh now , for you shall mourn and weep .
42:6:026:0	Woe when all men speak well of you , for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way .
42:6:027:0	“ But I say to you who hear , love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42:6:028:0	bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .
42:6:029:0	Whoever hits you on the cheek , offer him the other also ; and whoever takes away your coat , do not withhold your shirt from him either .
42:6:030:0	Give to everyone who asks of you , and whoever takes away what is yours , do not demand it back .
42:6:031:0	Treat others the same way you want them to treat you .
42:6:032:0	If you love those who love you , what credit is to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42:6:033:0	If you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is to you ? For even sinners do the same .
42:6:034:0	If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive , what credit is to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same
42:6:035:0	But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing in return ; and your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High ; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil
42:6:036:0	Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful .
42:6:037:0	“ Do not judge , and you will not be judged ; and do not condemn , and you will not be condemned ; pardon , and you will be pardoned .
42:6:038:0	Give , and it will be given to you . They will pour into your lap a good measure—pressed down , shaken together , running over . For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return . ”
42:6:039:0	And He also spoke a parable to them : “ A blind man cannot guide a blind man , can he ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
42:6:040:0	A pupil is not above his teacher ; but everyone , after he has been fully trained , will be like his teacher .
42:6:041:0	Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
42:6:042:0	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘Brother , let me take out the speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye .
42:6:043:0	For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit , nor , on the other hand , a bad tree which produces good fruit .
42:6:044:0	For each tree is known by its own fruit . For men do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush .
42:6:004:1	Builders and Foundations
42:6:045:0	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good ; and the evil out of the evil brings forth what is evil ; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart .
42:6:046:0	“ Why do you call Me , ‘Lord , Lord , ’ and do not do what I say ?
42:6:047:0	Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them , I will show you whom he is like :
42:6:048:0	he is like a man building a house , who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock ; and when a flood occurred , the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it , because it had been well built .
42:6:049:0	But the one who has heard and has not acted is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation ; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed , and the ruin of that house was great . ”
