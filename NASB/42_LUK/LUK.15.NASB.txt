42:15:001:1	The Lost Sheep
42:15:001:0	Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him .
42:15:002:0	Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble , saying , “ This man receives sinners and eats with them . ”
42:15:003:0	So He told them this parable , saying ,
42:15:004:0	“ What man among you , if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it ?
42:15:005:0	When he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42:15:006:0	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ‘Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! ’
42:15:002:1	The Lost Coin
42:15:007:0	I tell you that in the same way , there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance .
42:15:008:0	“ Or what woman , if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it ?
42:15:009:0	When she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin which I had lost ! ’
42:15:003:1	The Prodigal Son
42:15:010:0	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents . ”
42:15:011:0	And He said , “ A man had two sons .
42:15:012:0	The younger of them said to his father , ‘Father , give me the share of the estate that falls to me . ’ So he divided his wealth between them .
42:15:013:0	And not many days later , the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country , and there he squandered his estate with loose living .
42:15:014:0	Now when he had spent everything , a severe famine occurred in that country , and he began to be impoverished .
42:15:015:0	So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
42:15:016:0	And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating , and no one was giving to him .
42:15:017:0	But when he came to his senses , he said , ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more than enough bread , but I am dying here with hunger !
42:15:018:0	I will get up and go to my father , and will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in your sight ;
42:15:019:0	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; make me as one of your hired men . ” ’
42:15:020:0	So he got up and came to his father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt compassion and ran and embraced him and kissed him .
42:15:021:0	And the son said to him , ‘Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42:15:022:0	But the father said to his slaves , ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet ;
42:15:023:0	and bring the fattened calf , kill it , and let us eat and celebrate ;
42:15:024:0	for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again ; he was lost and has been found . ’ And they began to celebrate .
42:15:025:0	“ Now his older son was in the field , and when he came and approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
42:15:026:0	And he summoned one of the servants and inquiring what these things could be .
42:15:027:0	And he said to him , ‘Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound . ’
42:15:028:0	But he became angry and was not willing to go in ; and his father came out and pleading with him .
42:15:029:0	But he answered and said to his father , ‘Look ! For so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of yours ; and you have never given me a young goat , so that I might celebrate with my friends ;
42:15:030:0	but when this son of yours came , who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him . ’
42:15:031:0	And he said to him , ‘Son , you have always been with me , and all that is mine is yours .
42:15:032:0	But we had to celebrate and rejoice , for this brother of yours was dead and to live , and lost and has been found . ’ ”
