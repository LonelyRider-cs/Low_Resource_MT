42:16:001:1	The Unrighteous Steward
42:16:001:0	Now He was also saying to the disciples , “ There was a rich man who had a manager , and this was reported to him as squandering his possessions .
42:16:002:0	And he called him and said to him , ‘What is this I hear about you ? Give an accounting of your management , for you can no longer be manager . ’
42:16:003:0	The manager said to himself , ‘What shall I do , since my master is taking the management away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig ; I am ashamed to beg .
42:16:004:0	I know what I shall do , so that when I am removed from the management people will welcome me into their homes . ’
42:16:005:0	And he summoned each one of his master’s debtors , and he saying to the first , ‘How much do you owe my master ? ’
42:16:006:0	And he said , ‘A hundred measures of oil . ’ And he said to him , ‘Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . ’
42:16:007:0	Then he said to another , ‘And how much do you owe ? ’ And he said , ‘A hundred measures of wheat . ’ He *said to him , ‘Take your bill , and write eighty . ’
42:16:008:0	And his master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly ; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light .
42:16:009:0	And I say to you , make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness , so that when it fails , they will receive you into the eternal dwellings .
42:16:010:0	“ He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much ; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much .
42:16:011:0	Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth , who will entrust the true to you ?
42:16:012:0	And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s , who will give you that which is your own ?
42:16:013:0	No servant can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and wealth . ”
42:16:014:0	Now the Pharisees , who were lovers of money , were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him .
42:16:015:0	And He said to them , “ You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts ; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God .
42:16:016:0	“ The Law and the Prophets until John ; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached , and everyone is forcing his way into it .
42:16:017:0	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail .
42:16:002:1	The Rich Man and Lazarus
42:16:018:0	“ Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery .
42:16:019:0	“ Now there was a rich man , and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen , joyously living in splendor every day .
42:16:020:0	And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate , covered with sores ,
42:16:021:0	and longing to be fed with the which were falling from the rich man’s table ; besides , even the dogs were coming and licking his sores .
42:16:022:0	Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom ; and the rich man also died and was buried .
42:16:023:0	In Hades he lifted up his eyes , being in torment , and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom .
42:16:024:0	And he cried out and said , ‘Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue , for I am in agony in this flame . ’
42:16:025:0	But Abraham said , ‘Child , remember that during your life you received your good things , and likewise Lazarus bad things ; but now he is being comforted here , and you are in agony .
42:16:026:0	And besides all this , between us and you there is a great chasm fixed , so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able , and none may cross over from there to us . ’
42:16:027:0	And he said , ‘Then I beg you , father , that you send him to my father’s house—
42:16:028:0	for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them , so that they will not also come to this place of torment . ’
42:16:029:0	But Abraham *said , ‘They have Moses and the Prophets ; let them hear them . ’
42:16:030:0	But he said , ‘No , father Abraham , but if someone goes to them from the dead , they will repent ! ’
42:16:031:0	But he said to him , ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets , they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead . ’ ”
