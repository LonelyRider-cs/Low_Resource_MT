42:13:001:1	Call to Repent
42:13:001:0	Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
42:13:002:0	And Jesus said to them , “ Do you suppose that these Galileans were sinners than all Galileans because they suffered this
42:13:003:0	I tell you , no , but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish .
42:13:004:0	Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem ?
42:13:005:0	I tell you , no , but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish . ”
42:13:006:0	And He began telling this parable : “ A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard ; and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any .
42:13:007:0	And he said to the vineyard-keeper , ‘Behold , for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any . Cut it down ! Why does it even use up the ground ? ’
42:13:008:0	And he answered and said to him , ‘Let it alone , sir , for this year too , until I dig around it and put in fertilizer ;
42:13:002:1	Healing on the Sabbath
42:13:009:0	and if it bears fruit next year , but if not , cut it down . ’ ”
42:13:010:0	And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
42:13:011:0	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit ; and she was bent double , and could not straighten up at all .
42:13:012:0	When Jesus saw her , He called her over and said to her , “ Woman , you are freed from your sickness . ”
42:13:013:0	And He laid His hands on her ; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God .
42:13:014:0	But the synagogue official , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , began saying to the crowd in response , “ There are six days in which work should be done ; so come during them and get healed , and not on the Sabbath day . ”
42:13:015:0	But the Lord answered him and said , “ You hypocrites , does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water
42:13:016:0	And this woman , a daughter of Abraham as she is , whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years , should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day ? ”
42:13:003:1	Parables of Mustard Seed and Leaven
42:13:017:0	As He said this , all His opponents were being humiliated ; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him .
42:13:018:0	So He was saying , “ What is the kingdom of God like , and to what shall I compare it ?
42:13:019:0	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and threw into his own garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and . ”
42:13:020:0	And again He said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
42:13:004:1	Teaching in the Villages
42:13:021:0	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened . ”
42:13:022:0	And He was passing through from one city and village to another , teaching , and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem .
42:13:023:0	And someone said to Him , “ Lord , are there just a few who are being saved ? ” And He said to them ,
42:13:024:0	“ Strive to enter through the narrow door ; for many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
42:13:025:0	Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door , and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door , saying , ‘Lord , open up to us ! ’ then He will answer and say to you , ‘I do not know where you are from . ’
42:13:026:0	Then you will begin to say , ‘We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets’ ;
42:13:027:0	and He will say , ‘I tell you , I do not know where you are from ; M , . ’
42:13:028:0	In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves being thrown out .
42:13:029:0	And they will come from east and west and from north and south , and will recline in the kingdom of God .
42:13:030:0	And behold , are last who will be first and are first who will be last . ”
42:13:031:0	Just at that time some Pharisees approached , saying to Him , “ Go away , leave here , for Herod wants to kill You . ”
42:13:032:0	And He said to them , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third I reach My goal . ’
42:13:033:0	Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem .
42:13:034:0	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her ! How often I wanted to gather your children together , just as a hen her brood under her wings , and you would not
42:13:035:0	Behold , your house is left to you and I say to you , you will not see Me until comes when you say , ‘B H L ! ’ ”
