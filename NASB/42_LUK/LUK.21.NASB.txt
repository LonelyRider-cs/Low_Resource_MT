42:21:001:1	The Widow’s Gift
42:21:001:0	And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury .
42:21:002:0	And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins .
42:21:003:0	And He said , “ Truly I say to you , this poor widow put in more than all
42:21:004:0	for they all out of their surplus put into the offering ; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on . ”
42:21:005:0	And while some were talking about the temple , that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts , He said ,
42:21:006:0	“ these things which you are looking at , the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down . ”
42:21:007:0	They questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , when therefore will these things happen ? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place ? ”
42:21:008:0	And He said , “ See to it that you are not misled ; for many will come in My name , saying , ‘I am ’ and , ‘The time is near . ’ Do not go after them .
42:21:002:1	Things to Come
42:21:009:0	When you hear of wars and disturbances , do not be terrified ; for these things must take place first , but the end not immediately . ”
42:21:010:0	Then He continued by saying to them , “ Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom ,
42:21:011:0	and there will be great earthquakes , and in various places plagues and famines ; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven .
42:21:012:0	“ But before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , delivering you to the synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for My name’s sake .
42:21:013:0	It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony .
42:21:014:0	So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves ;
42:21:015:0	for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute .
42:21:016:0	But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and they will put of you to death ,
42:21:017:0	and you will be hated by all because of My name .
42:21:018:0	Yet not a hair of your head will perish .
42:21:019:0	By your endurance you will gain your lives .
42:21:020:0	“ But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then recognize that her desolation is near .
42:21:021:0	Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains , and those who are in the midst of the city must leave , and those who are in the country must not enter the city ;
42:21:022:0	because these are days of vengeance , so that all things which are written will be fulfilled .
42:21:023:0	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days ; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people ;
42:21:003:1	The Return of Christ
42:21:024:0	and they will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations ; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
42:21:025:0	“ There will be signs in sun and moon and stars , and on the earth dismay among nations , in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves ,
42:21:026:0	men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world ; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42:21:027:0	Then they will see S M with power and great glory .
42:21:028:0	But when these things begin to take place , straighten up and lift up your heads , because your redemption is drawing near . ”
42:21:029:0	Then He told them a parable : “ Behold the fig tree and all the trees ;
42:21:030:0	as soon as they put forth you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near .
42:21:031:0	So you also , when you see these things happening , recognize that the kingdom of God is near .
42:21:032:0	Truly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all things take place .
42:21:033:0	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
42:21:034:0	“ Be on guard , so that your hearts will not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life , and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap ;
42:21:035:0	for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth .
42:21:036:0	But keep on the alert at all times , praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place , and to stand before the Son of Man . ”
42:21:037:0	Now during the day He was teaching in the temple , but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet .
42:21:038:0	And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to Him .
