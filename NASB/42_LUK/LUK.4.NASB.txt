42:4:001:1	The Temptation of Jesus
42:4:001:0	Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness
42:4:002:0	for forty days , being tempted by the devil . And He ate nothing during those days , and when they had ended , He became hungry .
42:4:003:0	And the devil said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , tell this stone to become bread . ”
42:4:004:0	And Jesus answered him , “ It is written , ‘M . ’ ”
42:4:005:0	And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
42:4:006:0	And the devil said to Him , “ I will give You all this domain and its glory ; for it has been handed over to me , and I give it to whomever I wish .
42:4:007:0	Therefore if You worship before me , it shall all be Yours . ”
42:4:008:0	Jesus answered him , “ It is written , ‘Y L G H . ’ ”
42:4:009:0	And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down from here ;
42:4:010:0	for it is written , ‘He will command His angels concerning You to guard You , ’
42:4:011:0	and , ‘On their hands they will bear You up , So that You will not strike Your foot against a stone . ’ ”
42:4:012:0	And Jesus answered and said to him , “ It is said , ‘Y L G . ’ ”
42:4:002:1	Jesus’ Public Ministry
42:4:013:0	When the devil had finished every temptation , he left Him until an opportune time .
42:4:014:0	And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit , and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district .
42:4:015:0	And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all .
42:4:016:0	And He came to Nazareth , where He had been brought up ; and as was His custom , He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath , and stood up to read .
42:4:017:0	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him . And He opened the book and found the place where it was written ,
42:4:018:0	“ T S L M , B H M . H M , A , T ,
42:4:019:0	T L . ”
42:4:020:0	And He closed the book , gave it back to the attendant and sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him .
42:4:021:0	And He began to say to them , “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing . ”
42:4:022:0	And all were speaking well of Him , and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips ; and they were saying , “ Is this not Joseph’s son ? ”
42:4:023:0	And He said to them , “ No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me , ‘Physician , heal yourself ! Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum , do here in your hometown as well . ’ ”
42:4:024:0	And He said , “ Truly I say to you , no prophet is welcome in his hometown .
42:4:025:0	But I say to you in truth , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the sky was shut up for three years and six months , when a great famine came over all the land ;
42:4:026:0	and yet Elijah was sent to none of them , but only to Zarephath , of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42:4:027:0	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , but only Naaman the Syrian . ”
42:4:028:0	And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things ;
42:4:029:0	and they got up and drove Him out of the city , and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built , in order to throw Him down the cliff .
42:4:030:0	But passing through their midst , He went His way .
42:4:031:0	And He came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and He was teaching them on the Sabbath ;
42:4:032:0	and they were amazed at His teaching , for His message was with authority .
42:4:033:0	In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
42:4:034:0	“ Let us alone ! What business do we have with each other , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are—the Holy One of God ! ”
42:4:035:0	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be quiet and come out of him ! ” And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people , he came out of him without doing him any harm .
42:4:036:0	And amazement came upon them all , and they began talking with one another saying , “ What is this message ? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out . ”
42:4:003:1	Many Are Healed
42:4:037:0	And the report about Him was spreading into every locality in the surrounding district .
42:4:038:0	Then He got up and left the synagogue , and entered Simon’s home . Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever , and they asked Him to help her .
42:4:039:0	And standing over her , He rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and she immediately got up and waited on them .
42:4:040:0	While the sun was setting , all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him ; and laying His hands on each one of them , He was healing them .
42:4:041:0	Demons also were coming out of many , shouting , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But rebuking them , He would not allow them to speak , because they knew Him to be the Christ .
42:4:042:0	When day came , Jesus left and went to a secluded place ; and the crowds were searching for Him , and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them .
42:4:043:0	But He said to them , “ I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also , for I was sent for this purpose . ”
42:4:044:0	So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea .
