22:8:001:1	The Lovers Speak
22:8:001:0	“ Oh that you were like a brother to meWho nursed at my mother’s breasts . If I found you outdoors , I would kiss you ; No one would despise me , either .
22:8:002:0	I would lead you and bring youInto the house of my mother , who used to instruct me ; I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates .
22:8:003:0	Let his left hand be under my headAnd his right hand embrace me . ”
22:8:004:0	“ I want you to swear , O daughters of Jerusalem , Do not arouse or awaken my loveUntil she pleases . ”
22:8:005:0	“ Who is this coming up from the wildernessLeaning on her beloved ? ” “ Beneath the apple tree I awakened you ; There your mother was in labor with you , There she was in labor and gave you birth .
22:8:006:0	Put me like a seal over your heart , Like a seal on your arm . For love is as strong as death , Jealousy is as severe as Sheol ; Its flashes are flashes of fire , The very flame of the Lord .
22:8:007:0	Many waters cannot quench love , Nor will rivers overflow it ; If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love , It would be utterly despised . ”
22:8:008:0	“ We have a little sister , And she has no breasts ; What shall we do for our sisterOn the day when she is spoken for ?
22:8:009:0	If she is a wall , We will build on her a battlement of silver ; But if she is a door , We will barricade her with planks of cedar . ”
22:8:010:0	“ I was a wall , and my breasts were like towers ; Then I became in his eyes as one who finds peace .
22:8:011:0	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon ; He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers . Each one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit .
22:8:012:0	My very own vineyard is at my disposal ; The thousand shekels are for you , Solomon , And two hundred are for those who take care of its fruit . ”
22:8:013:0	“ O you who sit in the gardens , My companions are listening for your voice—Let me hear it ! ”
22:8:014:0	“ Hurry , my beloved , And be like a gazelle or a young stagOn the mountains of spices . ”
