22:3:001:1	The Bride’s Troubled Dream
22:3:001:0	“ On my bed night after night I sought himWhom my soul loves ; I sought him but did not find him .
22:3:002:0	‘I must arise now and go about the city ; In the streets and in the squaresI must seek him whom my soul loves . ’I sought him but did not find him .
22:3:003:0	The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me , And I said , ‘Have you seen him whom my soul loves ? ’
22:3:004:0	Scarcely had I left themWhen I found him whom my soul loves ; I held on to him and would not let him goUntil I had brought him to my mother’s house , And into the room of her who conceived me . ”
22:3:002:1	Solomon’s Wedding Day
22:3:005:0	“ I adjure you , O daughters of Jerusalem , By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field , That you will not arouse or awaken my loveUntil she pleases . ”
22:3:006:0	“ What is this coming up from the wildernessLike columns of smoke , Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , With all scented powders of the merchant ?
22:3:007:0	Behold , it is the traveling couch of Solomon ; Sixty mighty men around it , Of the mighty men of Israel .
22:3:008:0	All of them are wielders of the sword , Expert in war ; Each man has his sword at his side , Guarding against the terrors of the night .
22:3:009:0	King Solomon has made for himself a sedan chairFrom the timber of Lebanon .
22:3:010:0	He made its posts of silver , Its back of gold And its seat of purple fabric , With its interior lovingly fitted outBy the daughters of Jerusalem .
22:3:011:0	Go forth , O daughters of Zion , And gaze on King Solomon with the crownWith which his mother has crowned himOn the day of his wedding , And on the day of his gladness of heart . ”
