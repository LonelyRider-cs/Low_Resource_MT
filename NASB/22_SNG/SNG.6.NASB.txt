22:6:001:1	Mutual Delight in Each Other
22:6:001:0	“ Where has your beloved gone , O most beautiful among women ? Where has your beloved turned , That we may seek him with you ? ”
22:6:002:0	“ My beloved has gone down to his garden , To the beds of balsam , To pasture his flock in the gardensAnd gather lilies .
22:6:003:0	I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine , He who pastures his flock among the lilies . ”
22:6:004:0	“ You are as beautiful as Tirzah , my darling , As lovely as Jerusalem , As awesome as an army with banners .
22:6:005:0	Turn your eyes away from me , For they have confused me ; Your hair is like a flock of goatsThat have descended from Gilead .
22:6:006:0	Your teeth are like a flock of ewesWhich have come up from their washing , All of which bear twins , And not one among them has lost her young .
22:6:007:0	Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranateBehind your veil .
22:6:008:0	There are sixty queens and eighty concubines , And maidens without number ;
22:6:009:0	But my dove , my perfect one , is unique : She is her mother’s only daughter ; She is the pure child of the one who bore her . The maidens saw her and called her blessed , The queens and the concubines also , and they praised her , saying ,
22:6:010:0	‘Who is this that grows like the dawn , As beautiful as the full moon , As pure as the sun , As awesome as an army with banners ? ’
22:6:011:0	I went down to the orchard of nut treesTo see the blossoms of the valley , To see whether the vine had budded Or the pomegranates had bloomed .
22:6:012:0	Before I was aware , my soul set me Over the chariots of my noble people . ”
22:6:013:0	“ Come back , come back , O Shulammite ; Come back , come back , that we may gaze at you ! ” “ Why should you gaze at the Shulammite , As at the dance of the two companies ?
