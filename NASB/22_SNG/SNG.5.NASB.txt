22:5:001:1	The Torment of Separation
22:5:001:0	“ I have come into my garden , my sister , my bride ; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam . I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey ; I have drunk my wine and my milk . Eat , friends ; Drink and imbibe deeply , O lovers . ”
22:5:002:0	“ I was asleep but my heart was awake . A voice ! My beloved was knocking : ‘Open to me , my sister , my darling , My dove , my perfect one ! For my head is drenched with dew , My locks with the damp of the night . ’
22:5:003:0	I have taken off my dress , How can I put it on again ? I have washed my feet , How can I dirty them again ?
22:5:004:0	My beloved extended his hand through the opening , And my feelings were aroused for him .
22:5:005:0	I arose to open to my beloved ; And my hands dripped with myrrh , And my fingers with liquid myrrh , On the handles of the bolt .
22:5:006:0	I opened to my beloved , But my beloved had turned away and had gone ! My heart went out to him as he spoke . I searched for him but I did not find him ; I called him but he did not answer me .
22:5:007:0	The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me , They struck me and wounded me ; The guardsmen of the walls took away my shawl from me .
22:5:008:0	I adjure you , O daughters of Jerusalem , If you find my beloved , As to what you will tell him : For I am lovesick . ”
22:5:002:1	Admiration by the Bride
22:5:009:0	“ What kind of beloved is your beloved , O most beautiful among women ? What kind of beloved is your beloved , That thus you adjure us ? ”
22:5:010:0	“ My beloved is dazzling and ruddy , Outstanding among ten thousand .
22:5:011:0	His head is like gold , pure gold ; His locks are like clusters of dates And black as a raven .
22:5:012:0	His eyes are like dovesBeside streams of water , Bathed in milk , And reposed in their setting .
22:5:013:0	His cheeks are like a bed of balsam , Banks of sweet-scented herbs ; His lips are liliesDripping with liquid myrrh .
22:5:014:0	His hands are rods of goldSet with beryl ; His abdomen is carved ivoryInlaid with sapphires .
22:5:015:0	His legs are pillars of alabasterSet on pedestals of pure gold ; His appearance is like LebanonChoice as the cedars .
22:5:016:0	His mouth is full of sweetness . And he is wholly desirable . This is my beloved and this is my friend , O daughters of Jerusalem . ”
