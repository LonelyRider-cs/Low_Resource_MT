22:4:001:1	Solomon’s Love Expressed
22:4:001:0	“ How beautiful you are , my darling , How beautiful you are ! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil ; Your hair is like a flock of goatsThat have descended from Mount Gilead .
22:4:002:0	Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn ewesWhich have come up from their washing , All of which bear twins , And not one among them has lost her young .
22:4:003:0	Your lips are like a scarlet thread , And your mouth is lovely . Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranateBehind your veil .
22:4:004:0	Your neck is like the tower of David , Built with rows of stonesOn which are hung a thousand shields , All the round shields of the mighty men .
22:4:005:0	Your two breasts are like two fawns , Twins of a gazelleWhich feed among the lilies .
22:4:006:0	Until the cool of the dayWhen the shadows flee away , I will go my way to the mountain of myrrhAnd to the hill of frankincense .
22:4:007:0	“ You are altogether beautiful , my darling , And there is no blemish in you .
22:4:008:0	Come with me from Lebanon , my bride , May you come with me from Lebanon . Journey down from the summit of Amana , From the summit of Senir and Hermon , From the dens of lions , From the mountains of leopards .
22:4:009:0	You have made my heart beat faster , my sister , my bride ; You have made my heart beat faster with a single glance of your eyes , With a single strand of your necklace .
22:4:010:0	How beautiful is your love , my sister , my bride ! How much better is your love than wine , And the fragrance of your oilsThan all kinds of spices !
22:4:011:0	Your lips , my bride , drip honey ; Honey and milk are under your tongue , And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon .
22:4:012:0	A garden locked is my sister , my bride , A rock garden locked , a spring sealed up .
22:4:013:0	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranatesWith choice fruits , henna with nard plants ,
22:4:014:0	Nard and saffron , calamus and cinnamon , With all the trees of frankincense , Myrrh and aloes , along with all the finest spices .
22:4:015:0	You are a garden spring , A well of fresh water , And streams flowing from Lebanon . ”
22:4:016:0	“ Awake , O north wind , And come , wind of the south ; Make my garden breathe out fragrance , Let its spices be wafted abroad . May my beloved come into his gardenAnd eat its choice fruits ! ”
