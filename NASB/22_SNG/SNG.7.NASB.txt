22:7:001:1	Admiration by the Bridegroom
22:7:001:0	“ How beautiful are your feet in sandals , O prince’s daughter ! The curves of your hips are like jewels , The work of the hands of an artist .
22:7:002:0	Your navel is like a round gobletWhich never lacks mixed wine ; Your belly is like a heap of wheatFenced about with lilies .
22:7:003:0	Your two breasts are like two fawns , Twins of a gazelle .
22:7:004:0	Your neck is like a tower of ivory , Your eyes like the pools in HeshbonBy the gate of Bath-rabbim ; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon , Which faces toward Damascus .
22:7:005:0	Your head crowns you like Carmel , And the flowing locks of your head are like purple threads ; The king is captivated by your tresses .
22:7:006:0	How beautiful and how delightful you are , My love , with all your charms !
22:7:007:0	Your stature is like a palm tree , And your breasts are like its clusters .
22:7:008:0	I said , ‘I will climb the palm tree , I will take hold of its fruit stalks . ’Oh , may your breasts be like clusters of the vine , And the fragrance of your breath like apples ,
22:7:002:1	The Union of Love
22:7:009:0	And your mouth like the best wine ! ” “ It goes down smoothly for my beloved , Flowing gently through the lips of those who fall asleep .
22:7:010:0	“ I am my beloved’s , And his desire is for me .
22:7:011:0	Come , my beloved , let us go out into the country , Let us spend the night in the villages .
22:7:012:0	Let us rise early and go to the vineyards ; Let us see whether the vine has budded And its blossoms have opened , And whether the pomegranates have bloomed . There I will give you my love .
22:7:013:0	The mandrakes have given forth fragrance ; And over our doors are all choice fruits , Both new and old , Which I have saved up for you , my beloved .
