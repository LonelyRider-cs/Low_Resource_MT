7:12:001:1	Jephthah and His Successors
7:12:001:0	Then the men of Ephraim were summoned , and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah , “ Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon without calling us to go with you ? We will burn your house down on you . ”
7:12:002:0	Jephthah said to them , “ I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon ; when I called you , you did not deliver me from their hand .
7:12:003:0	When I saw that you would not deliver me , I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon , and the Lord gave them into my hand . Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me ? ”
7:12:004:0	Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim ; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim , because they said , “ You are fugitives of Ephraim , O Gileadites , in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh . ”
7:12:005:0	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim . And it happened when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said , “ Let me cross over , ” the men of Gilead would say to him , “ Are you an Ephraimite ? ” If he said , “ No , ”
7:12:006:0	then they would say to him , “ Say now , ‘Shibboleth . ’ ” But he said , “ Sibboleth , ” for he could not pronounce it correctly . Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan . Thus there fell at that time 42 , 000 of Ephraim .
7:12:007:0	Jephthah judged Israel six years . Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
7:12:008:0	Now Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel after him .
7:12:009:0	He had thirty sons , and thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage outside the family , and he brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons . And he judged Israel seven years .
7:12:010:0	Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem .
7:12:011:0	Now Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel after him ; and he judged Israel ten years .
7:12:012:0	Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun .
7:12:013:0	Now Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel after him .
7:12:014:0	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys ; and he judged Israel eight years .
7:12:015:0	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the hill country of the Amalekites .
