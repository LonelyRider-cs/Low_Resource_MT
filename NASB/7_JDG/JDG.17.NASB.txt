7:17:001:1	Micah’s Idolatry
7:17:001:0	Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah .
7:17:002:0	He said to his mother , “ The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you , about which you uttered a curse in my hearing , behold , the silver is with me ; I took it . ” And his mother said , “ Blessed be my son by the Lord . ”
7:17:003:0	He then returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother , and his mother said , “ I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the Lord for my son to make a graven image and a molten image ; now therefore , I will return them to you . ”
7:17:004:0	So when he returned the silver to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made them into a graven image and a molten image , and they were in the house of Micah .
7:17:005:0	And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household idols and consecrated one of his sons , that he might become his priest .
7:17:006:0	In those days there was no king in Israel ; every man did what was right in his own eyes .
7:17:007:0	Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah , of the family of Judah , who was a Levite ; and he was staying there .
7:17:008:0	Then the man departed from the city , from Bethlehem in Judah , to stay wherever he might find a place ; and as he made his journey , he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah .
7:17:009:0	Micah said to him , “ Where do you come from ? ” And he said to him , “ I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , and I am going to stay wherever I may find a place . ”
7:17:010:0	Micah then said to him , “ Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me , and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year , a suit of clothes , and your maintenance . ” So the Levite went in .
7:17:011:0	The Levite agreed to live with the man , and the young man became to him like one of his sons .
7:17:012:0	So Micah consecrated the Levite , and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah .
7:17:013:0	Then Micah said , “ Now I know that the Lord will prosper me , seeing I have a Levite as priest . ”
