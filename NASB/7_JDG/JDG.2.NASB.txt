7:2:001:1	Israel Rebuked
7:2:001:0	Now the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim . And he said , “ I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have sworn to your fathers ; and I said , ‘I will never break My covenant with you ,
7:2:002:0	and as for you , you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall tear down their altars . ’ But you have not obeyed Me ; what is this you have done ?
7:2:003:0	Therefore I also said , ‘I will not drive them out before you ; but they will become as thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you . ’ ”
7:2:004:0	When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the sons of Israel , the people lifted up their voices and wept .
7:2:002:1	Joshua Dies
7:2:005:0	So they named that place Bochim ; and there they sacrificed to the Lord .
7:2:006:0	When Joshua had dismissed the people , the sons of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land .
7:2:007:0	The people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua , who had seen all the great work of the Lord which He had done for Israel .
7:2:008:0	Then Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died at the age of one hundred and ten .
7:2:009:0	And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres , in the hill country of Ephraim , north of Mount Gaash .
7:2:003:1	Israel Serves Baals
7:2:010:0	All that generation also were gathered to their fathers ; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord , nor yet the work which He had done for Israel .
7:2:011:0	Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals ,
7:2:012:0	and they forsook the Lord , the God of their fathers , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them ; thus they provoked the Lord to anger .
7:2:013:0	So they forsook the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtaroth .
7:2:014:0	The anger of the Lord burned against Israel , and He gave them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them ; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them , so that they could no longer stand before their enemies .
7:2:015:0	Wherever they went , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had spoken and as the Lord had sworn to them , so that they were severely distressed .
7:2:016:0	Then the Lord raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them .
7:2:017:0	Yet they did not listen to their judges , for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them . They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the Lord ; they did not do as their fathers .
7:2:018:0	When the Lord raised up judges for them , the Lord was with the judge and delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge ; for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them .
7:2:019:0	But it came about when the judge died , that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers , in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them ; they did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways .
7:2:020:0	So the anger of the Lord burned against Israel , and He said , “ Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice ,
7:2:021:0	I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died ,
7:2:022:0	in order to test Israel by them , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk in it as their fathers did , or not . ”
7:2:023:0	So the Lord allowed those nations to remain , not driving them out quickly ; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua .
