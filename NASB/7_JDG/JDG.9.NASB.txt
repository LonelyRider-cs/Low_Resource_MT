7:9:001:1	Abimelech’s Conspiracy
7:9:001:0	And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s relatives , and spoke to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother’s father , saying ,
7:9:002:0	“ Speak , now , in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem , ‘Which is better for you , that seventy men , all the sons of Jerubbaal , rule over you , or that one man rule over you ? ’ Also , remember that I am your bone and your flesh . ”
7:9:003:0	And his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem ; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech , for they said , “ He is our relative . ”
7:9:004:0	They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows , and they followed him .
7:9:005:0	Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal , seventy men , on one stone . But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left , for he hid himself .
7:9:006:0	All the men of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together , and they went and made Abimelech king , by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem .
7:9:007:0	Now when they told Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted his voice and called out . Thus he said to them , “ Listen to me , O men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
7:9:008:0	Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them , and they said to the olive tree , ‘Reign over us ! ’
7:9:009:0	But the olive tree said to them , ‘Shall I leave my fatness with which God and men are honored , and go to wave over the trees ? ’
7:9:010:0	Then the trees said to the fig tree , ‘You come , reign over us ! ’
7:9:011:0	But the fig tree said to them , ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit , and go to wave over the trees ? ’
7:9:012:0	Then the trees said to the vine , ‘You come , reign over us ! ’
7:9:013:0	But the vine said to them , ‘Shall I leave my new wine , which cheers God and men , and go to wave over the trees ? ’
7:9:014:0	Finally all the trees said to the bramble , ‘You come , reign over us ! ’
7:9:015:0	The bramble said to the trees , ‘If in truth you are anointing me as king over you , come and take refuge in my shade ; but if not , may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon . ’
7:9:016:0	“ Now therefore , if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making Abimelech king , and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have dealt with him as he deserved—
7:9:017:0	for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian ;
7:9:018:0	but you have risen against my father’s house today and have killed his sons , seventy men , on one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your relative—
7:9:019:0	if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day , rejoice in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you .
7:9:020:0	But if not , let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and Beth-millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from Beth-millo , and consume Abimelech . ”
7:9:002:1	Shechem and Abimelech Fall
7:9:021:0	Then Jotham escaped and fled , and went to Beer and remained there because of Abimelech his brother .
7:9:022:0	Now Abimelech ruled over Israel three years .
7:9:023:0	Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech ,
7:9:024:0	so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come , and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother , who killed them , and on the men of Shechem , who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers .
7:9:025:0	The men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who might pass by them along the road ; and it was told to Abimelech .
7:9:026:0	Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives , and crossed over into Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him .
7:9:027:0	They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards and trod them , and held a festival ; and they went into the house of their god , and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech .
7:9:028:0	Then Gaal the son of Ebed said , “ Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serve him ? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal , and is Zebul not his lieutenant ? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem ; but why should we serve him ?
7:9:029:0	Would , therefore , that this people were under my authority ! Then I would remove Abimelech . ” And he said to Abimelech , “ Increase your army and come out . ”
7:9:030:0	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger burned .
7:9:031:0	He sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully , saying , “ Behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem ; and behold , they are stirring up the city against you .
7:9:032:0	Now therefore , arise by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field .
7:9:033:0	In the morning , as soon as the sun is up , you shall rise early and rush upon the city ; and behold , when he and the people who are with him come out against you , you shall do to them whatever you can . ”
7:9:034:0	So Abimelech and all the people who were with him arose by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies .
7:9:035:0	Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate ; and Abimelech and the people who were with him arose from the ambush .
7:9:036:0	When Gaal saw the people , he said to Zebul , “ Look , people are coming down from the tops of the mountains . ” But Zebul said to him , “ You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men . ”
7:9:037:0	Gaal spoke again and said , “ Behold , people are coming down from the highest part of the land , and one company comes by the way of the diviners’ oak . ”
7:9:038:0	Then Zebul said to him , “ Where is your boasting now with which you said , ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him ? ’ Is this not the people whom you despised ? Go out now and fight with them ! ”
7:9:039:0	So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech .
7:9:040:0	Abimelech chased him , and he fled before him ; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate .
7:9:041:0	Then Abimelech remained at Arumah , but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem .
7:9:042:0	Now it came about the next day , that the people went out to the field , and it was told to Abimelech .
7:9:043:0	So he took his people and divided them into three companies , and lay in wait in the field ; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city , he arose against them and slew them .
7:9:044:0	Then Abimelech and the company who was with him dashed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate ; the other two companies then dashed against all who were in the field and slew them .
7:9:045:0	Abimelech fought against the city all that day , and he captured the city and killed the people who were in it ; then he razed the city and sowed it with salt .
7:9:046:0	When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard of it , they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith .
7:9:047:0	It was told Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
7:9:048:0	So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon , he and all the people who were with him ; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees , and lifted it and laid it on his shoulder . Then he said to the people who were with him , “ What you have seen me do , hurry and do likewise . ”
7:9:049:0	All the people also cut down each one his branch and followed Abimelech , and put them on the inner chamber and set the inner chamber on fire over those inside , so that all the men of the tower of Shechem also died , about a thousand men and women .
7:9:050:0	Then Abimelech went to Thebez , and he camped against Thebez and captured it .
7:9:051:0	But there was a strong tower in the center of the city , and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in ; and they went up on the roof of the tower .
7:9:052:0	So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it , and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire .
7:9:053:0	But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head , crushing his skull .
7:9:054:0	Then he called quickly to the young man , his armor bearer , and said to him , “ Draw your sword and kill me , so that it will not be said of me , ‘A woman slew him . ’ ” So the young man pierced him through , and he died .
7:9:055:0	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , each departed to his home .
7:9:056:0	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech , which he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers .
7:9:057:0	Also God returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads , and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them .
