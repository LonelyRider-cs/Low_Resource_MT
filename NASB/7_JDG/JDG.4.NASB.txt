7:4:001:1	Deborah and Barak Deliver from Canaanites
7:4:001:0	Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord , after Ehud died .
7:4:002:0	And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor ; and the commander of his army was Sisera , who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim .
7:4:003:0	The sons of Israel cried to the Lord ; for he had nine hundred iron chariots , and he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for twenty years .
7:4:004:0	Now Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lappidoth , was judging Israel at that time .
7:4:005:0	She used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment .
7:4:006:0	Now she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali , and said to him , “ Behold , the Lord , the God of Israel , has commanded , ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor , and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun .
7:4:007:0	I will draw out to you Sisera , the commander of Jabin’s army , with his chariots and his many troops to the river Kishon , and I will give him into your hand . ’ ”
7:4:008:0	Then Barak said to her , “ If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . ”
7:4:009:0	She said , “ I will surely go with you ; nevertheless , the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take , for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman . ” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh .
7:4:010:0	Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh , and ten thousand men went up with him ; Deborah also went up with him .
7:4:011:0	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites , from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses , and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim , which is near Kedesh .
7:4:012:0	Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor .
7:4:013:0	Sisera called together all his chariots , nine hundred iron chariots , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon .
7:4:014:0	Deborah said to Barak , “ Arise ! For this is the day in which the Lord has given Sisera into your hands ; behold , the Lord has gone out before you . ” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him .
7:4:015:0	The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot .
7:4:016:0	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim , and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; not even one was left .
7:4:017:0	Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite , for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
7:4:018:0	Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , “ Turn aside , my master , turn aside to me ! Do not be afraid . ” And he turned aside to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
7:4:019:0	He said to her , “ Please give me a little water to drink , for I am thirsty . ” So she opened a bottle of milk and gave him a drink ; then she covered him .
7:4:020:0	He said to her , “ Stand in the doorway of the tent , and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you , and says , ‘Is there anyone here ? ’ that you shall say , ‘No . ’ ”
7:4:021:0	But Jael , Heber’s wife , took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand , and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple , and it went through into the ground ; for he was sound asleep and exhausted . So he died .
7:4:022:0	And behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael came out to meet him and said to him , “ Come , and I will show you the man whom you are seeking . ” And he entered with her , and behold Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple .
7:4:023:0	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel .
7:4:024:0	The hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan .
