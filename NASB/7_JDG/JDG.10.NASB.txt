7:10:001:1	Oppression of Philistines and Ammonites
7:10:001:0	Now after Abimelech died , Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar , arose to save Israel ; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim .
7:10:002:0	He judged Israel twenty-three years . Then he died and was buried in Shamir .
7:10:003:0	After him , Jair the Gileadite arose and judged Israel twenty-two years .
7:10:004:0	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys , and they had thirty cities in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair to this day .
7:10:005:0	And Jair died and was buried in Kamon .
7:10:006:0	Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord , served the Baals and the Ashtaroth , the gods of Aram , the gods of Sidon , the gods of Moab , the gods of the sons of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines ; thus they forsook the Lord and did not serve Him .
7:10:007:0	The anger of the Lord burned against Israel , and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon .
7:10:008:0	They afflicted and crushed the sons of Israel that year ; for eighteen years they afflicted all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in Gilead in the land of the Amorites .
7:10:009:0	The sons of Ammon crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah , Benjamin , and the house of Ephraim , so that Israel was greatly distressed .
7:10:010:0	Then the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord , saying , “ We have sinned against You , for indeed , we have forsaken our God and served the Baals . ”
7:10:011:0	The Lord said to the sons of Israel , “ Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians , the Amorites , the sons of Ammon , and the Philistines ?
7:10:012:0	Also when the Sidonians , the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you , you cried out to Me , and I delivered you from their hands .
7:10:013:0	Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods ; therefore I will no longer deliver you .
7:10:014:0	Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen ; let them deliver you in the time of your distress . ”
7:10:015:0	The sons of Israel said to the Lord , “ We have sinned , do to us whatever seems good to You ; only please deliver us this day . ”
7:10:016:0	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord ; and He could bear the misery of Israel no longer .
7:10:017:0	Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and they camped in Gilead . And the sons of Israel gathered together and camped in Mizpah .
7:10:018:0	The people , the leaders of Gilead , said to one another , “ Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon ? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . ”
