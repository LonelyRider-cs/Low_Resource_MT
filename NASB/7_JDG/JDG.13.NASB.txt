7:13:001:1	Philistines Oppress Again
7:13:001:0	Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord , so that the Lord gave them into the hands of the Philistines forty years .
7:13:002:0	There was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren and had borne no children .
7:13:003:0	Then the angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her , “ Behold now , you are barren and have borne no children , but you shall conceive and give birth to a son .
7:13:004:0	Now therefore , be careful not to drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing .
7:13:005:0	For behold , you shall conceive and give birth to a son , and no razor shall come upon his head , for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb ; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines . ”
7:13:006:0	Then the woman came and told her husband , saying , “ A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God , very awesome . And I did not ask him where he came from , nor did he tell me his name .
7:13:007:0	But he said to me , ‘Behold , you shall conceive and give birth to a son , and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing , for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death . ’ ”
7:13:008:0	Then Manoah entreated the Lord and said , “ O Lord , please let the man of God whom You have sent come to us again that he may teach us what to do for the boy who is to be born . ”
7:13:009:0	God listened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field , but Manoah her husband was not with her .
7:13:010:0	So the woman ran quickly and told her husband , “ Behold , the man who came the other day has appeared to me . ”
7:13:011:0	Then Manoah arose and followed his wife , and when he came to the man he said to him , “ Are you the man who spoke to the woman ? ” And he said , “ I am . ”
7:13:012:0	Manoah said , “ Now when your words come to pass , what shall be the boy’s mode of life and his vocation ? ”
7:13:013:0	So the angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ Let the woman pay attention to all that I said .
7:13:014:0	She should not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing ; let her observe all that I commanded . ”
7:13:015:0	Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ Please let us detain you so that we may prepare a young goat for you . ”
7:13:016:0	The angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ Though you detain me , I will not eat your food , but if you prepare a burnt offering , then offer it to the Lord . ” For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord .
7:13:017:0	Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ What is your name , so that when your words come to pass , we may honor you ? ”
7:13:018:0	But the angel of the Lord said to him , “ Why do you ask my name , seeing it is wonderful ? ”
7:13:019:0	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the Lord , and He performed wonders while Manoah and his wife looked on .
7:13:020:0	For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven , that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar . When Manoah and his wife saw this , they fell on their faces to the ground .
7:13:021:0	Now the angel of the Lord did not appear to Manoah or his wife again . Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord .
7:13:022:0	So Manoah said to his wife , “ We will surely die , for we have seen God . ”
7:13:023:0	But his wife said to him , “ If the Lord had desired to kill us , He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands , nor would He have shown us all these things , nor would He have let us hear things like this at this time . ”
7:13:024:0	Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson ; and the child grew up and the Lord blessed him .
7:13:025:0	And the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan , between Zorah and Eshtaol .
