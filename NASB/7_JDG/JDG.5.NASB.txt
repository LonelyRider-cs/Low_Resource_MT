7:5:001:1	The Song of Deborah and Barak
7:5:001:0	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day , saying ,
7:5:002:0	“ That the leaders led in Israel , That the people volunteered , Bless the Lord !
7:5:003:0	Hear , O kings ; give ear , O rulers ! I—to the Lord , I will sing , I will sing praise to the Lord , the God of Israel .
7:5:004:0	Lord , when You went out from Seir , When You marched from the field of Edom , The earth quaked , the heavens also dripped , Even the clouds dripped water .
7:5:005:0	The mountains quaked at the presence of the Lord , This Sinai , at the presence of the Lord , the God of Israel .
7:5:006:0	“ In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , In the days of Jael , the highways were deserted , And travelers went by roundabout ways .
7:5:007:0	The peasantry ceased , they ceased in Israel , Until I , Deborah , arose , Until I arose , a mother in Israel .
7:5:008:0	New gods were chosen ; Then war was in the gates . Not a shield or a spear was seenAmong forty thousand in Israel .
7:5:009:0	My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel , The volunteers among the people ; Bless the Lord !
7:5:010:0	You who ride on white donkeys , You who sit on rich carpets , And you who travel on the road—sing !
7:5:011:0	At the sound of those who divide flocks among the watering places , There they shall recount the righteous deeds of the Lord , The righteous deeds for His peasantry in Israel . Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates .
7:5:012:0	“ Awake , awake , Deborah ; Awake , awake , sing a song ! Arise , Barak , and take away your captives , O son of Abinoam .
7:5:013:0	Then survivors came down to the nobles ; The people of the Lord came down to me as warriors .
7:5:014:0	From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down , Following you , Benjamin , with your peoples ; From Machir commanders came down , And from Zebulun those who wield the staff of office .
7:5:015:0	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; As was Issachar , so was Barak ; Into the valley they rushed at his heels ; Among the divisions of Reuben There were great resolves of heart .
7:5:016:0	Why did you sit among the sheepfolds , To hear the piping for the flocks ? Among the divisions of Reuben There were great searchings of heart .
7:5:017:0	Gilead remained across the Jordan ; And why did Dan stay in ships ? Asher sat at the seashore , And remained by its landings .
7:5:018:0	Zebulun was a people who despised their lives even to death , And Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
7:5:019:0	“ The kings came and fought ; Then fought the kings of CanaanAt Taanach near the waters of Megiddo ; They took no plunder in silver .
7:5:020:0	The stars fought from heaven , From their courses they fought against Sisera .
7:5:021:0	The torrent of Kishon swept them away , The ancient torrent , the torrent Kishon . O my soul , march on with strength .
7:5:022:0	Then the horses’ hoofs beatFrom the dashing , the dashing of his valiant steeds .
7:5:023:0	‘Curse Meroz , ’ said the angel of the Lord , ‘Utterly curse its inhabitants ; Because they did not come to the help of the Lord , To the help of the Lord against the warriors . ’
7:5:024:0	“ Most blessed of women is Jael , The wife of Heber the Kenite ; Most blessed is she of women in the tent .
7:5:025:0	He asked for water and she gave him milk ; In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds .
7:5:026:0	She reached out her hand for the tent peg , And her right hand for the workmen’s hammer . Then she struck Sisera , she smashed his head ; And she shattered and pierced his temple .
7:5:027:0	Between her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay ; Between her feet he bowed , he fell ; Where he bowed , there he fell dead .
7:5:028:0	“ Out of the window she looked and lamented , The mother of Sisera through the lattice , ‘Why does his chariot delay in coming ? Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry ? ’
7:5:029:0	Her wise princesses would answer her , Indeed she repeats her words to herself ,
7:5:030:0	‘Are they not finding , are they not dividing the spoil ? A maiden , two maidens for every warrior ; To Sisera a spoil of dyed work , A spoil of dyed work embroidered , Dyed work of double embroidery on the neck of the spoiler ? ’
7:5:031:0	Thus let all Your enemies perish , O Lord ; But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might . ” And the land was undisturbed for forty years .
