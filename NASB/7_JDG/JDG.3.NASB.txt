7:3:001:1	Idolatry Leads to Servitude
7:3:001:0	Now these are the nations which the Lord left , to test Israel by them ( that is , all who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan ;
7:3:002:0	only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war , those who had not experienced it formerly ) .
7:3:003:0	These nations are : the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon , from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath .
7:3:004:0	They were for testing Israel , to find out if they would obey the commandments of the Lord , which He had commanded their fathers through Moses .
7:3:005:0	The sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ;
7:3:006:0	and they took their daughters for themselves as wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
7:3:007:0	The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , and forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
7:3:002:1	The First Judge Delivers Israel
7:3:008:0	Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , so that He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia ; and the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years .
7:3:009:0	When the sons of Israel cried to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them , Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb’s younger brother .
7:3:010:0	The Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he judged Israel . When he went out to war , the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand , so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim .
7:3:011:0	Then the land had rest forty years . And Othniel the son of Kenaz died .
7:3:012:0	Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord . So the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
7:3:013:0	And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek ; and he went and defeated Israel , and they possessed the city of the palm trees .
7:3:003:1	Ehud Delivers from Moab
7:3:014:0	The sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years .
7:3:015:0	But when the sons of Israel cried to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer for them , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjamite , a left-handed man . And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab .
7:3:016:0	Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges , a cubit in length , and he bound it on his right thigh under his cloak .
7:3:017:0	He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab . Now Eglon was a very fat man .
7:3:018:0	It came about when he had finished presenting the tribute , that he sent away the people who had carried the tribute .
7:3:019:0	But he himself turned back from the idols which were at Gilgal , and said , “ I have a secret message for you , O king . ” And he said , “ Keep silence . ” And all who attended him left him .
7:3:020:0	Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber . And Ehud said , “ I have a message from God for you . ” And he arose from his seat .
7:3:021:0	Ehud stretched out his left hand , took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly .
7:3:022:0	The handle also went in after the blade , and the fat closed over the blade , for he did not draw the sword out of his belly ; and the refuse came out .
7:3:023:0	Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the roof chamber behind him , and locked them .
7:3:024:0	When he had gone out , his servants came and looked , and behold , the doors of the roof chamber were locked ; and they said , “ He is only relieving himself in the cool room . ”
7:3:025:0	They waited until they became anxious ; but behold , he did not open the doors of the roof chamber . Therefore they took the key and opened them , and behold , their master had fallen to the floor dead .
7:3:026:0	Now Ehud escaped while they were delaying , and he passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah .
7:3:027:0	It came about when he had arrived , that he blew the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim ; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he was in front of them .
7:3:028:0	He said to them , “ Pursue them , for the Lord has given your enemies the Moabites into your hands . ” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab , and did not allow anyone to cross .
7:3:029:0	They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabites , all robust and valiant men ; and no one escaped .
7:3:004:1	Shamgar Delivers from Philistines
7:3:030:0	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . And the land was undisturbed for eighty years .
7:3:031:0	After him came Shamgar the son of Anath , who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad ; and he also saved Israel .
