7:20:001:1	Resolve to Punish the Guilty
7:20:001:0	Then all the sons of Israel from Dan to Beersheba , including the land of Gilead , came out , and the congregation assembled as one man to the Lord at Mizpah .
7:20:002:0	The chiefs of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , took their stand in the assembly of the people of God , 400 , 000 foot soldiers who drew the sword .
7:20:003:0	( Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . ) And the sons of Israel said , “ Tell us , how did this wickedness take place ? ”
7:20:004:0	So the Levite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answered and said , “ I came with my concubine to spend the night at Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin .
7:20:005:0	But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me . They intended to kill me ; instead , they ravished my concubine so that she died .
7:20:006:0	And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance ; for they have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel .
7:20:007:0	Behold , all you sons of Israel , give your advice and counsel here . ”
7:20:008:0	Then all the people arose as one man , saying , “ Not one of us will go to his tent , nor will any of us return to his house .
7:20:009:0	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah ; we will go up against it by lot .
7:20:010:0	And we will take 10 men out of 100 throughout the tribes of Israel , and 100 out of 1 , 000 , and 1 , 000 out of 10 , 000 to supply food for the people , that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin , they may punish them for all the disgraceful acts that they have committed in Israel . ”
7:20:011:0	Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , united as one man .
7:20:012:0	Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin , saying , “ What is this wickedness that has taken place among you ?
7:20:013:0	Now then , deliver up the men , the worthless fellows in Gibeah , that we may put them to death and remove this wickedness from Israel . ” But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers , the sons of Israel .
7:20:014:0	The sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah , to go out to battle against the sons of Israel .
7:20:015:0	From the cities on that day the sons of Benjamin were numbered , 26 , 000 men who draw the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who were numbered , 700 choice men .
7:20:016:0	Out of all these people 700 choice men were left-handed ; each one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss .
7:20:002:1	Civil War , Benjamin Defeated
7:20:017:0	Then the men of Israel besides Benjamin were numbered , 400 , 000 men who draw the sword ; all these were men of war .
7:20:018:0	Now the sons of Israel arose , went up to Bethel , and inquired of God and said , “ Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin ? ” Then the Lord said , “ Judah shall go up first . ”
7:20:019:0	So the sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah .
7:20:020:0	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin , and the men of Israel arrayed for battle against them at Gibeah .
7:20:021:0	Then the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and felled to the ground on that day 22 , 000 men of Israel .
7:20:022:0	But the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the first day .
7:20:023:0	The sons of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening , and inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall we again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up against him . ”
7:20:024:0	Then the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day .
7:20:025:0	Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and felled to the ground again 18 , 000 men of the sons of Israel ; all these drew the sword .
7:20:026:0	Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept ; thus they remained there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening . And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
7:20:027:0	The sons of Israel inquired of the Lord ( for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
7:20:028:0	and Phinehas the son of Eleazar , Aaron’s son , stood before it to minister in those days ) , saying , “ Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin , or shall I cease ? ” And the Lord said , “ Go up , for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand . ”
7:20:029:0	So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah .
7:20:030:0	The sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times .
7:20:031:0	The sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city , and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times , on the highways , one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah , and in the field , about thirty men of Israel .
7:20:032:0	The sons of Benjamin said , “ They are struck down before us , as at the first . ” But the sons of Israel said , “ Let us flee that we may draw them away from the city to the highways . ”
7:20:033:0	Then all the men of Israel arose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar ; and the men of Israel in ambush broke out of their place , even out of Maareh-geba .
7:20:034:0	When ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah , the battle became fierce ; but Benjamin did not know that disaster was close to them .
7:20:035:0	And the Lord struck Benjamin before Israel , so that the sons of Israel destroyed 25 , 100 men of Benjamin that day , all who draw the sword .
7:20:036:0	So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated . When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah ,
7:20:037:0	the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah ; the men in ambush also deployed and struck all the city with the edge of the sword .
7:20:038:0	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city .
7:20:039:0	Then the men of Israel turned in the battle , and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel , for they said , “ Surely they are defeated before us , as in the first battle . ”
7:20:040:0	But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke , Benjamin looked behind them ; and behold , the whole city was going up in smoke to heaven .
7:20:041:0	Then the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were terrified ; for they saw that disaster was close to them .
7:20:042:0	Therefore , they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness , but the battle overtook them while those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them .
7:20:043:0	They surrounded Benjamin , pursued them without rest and trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east .
7:20:044:0	Thus 18 , 000 men of Benjamin fell ; all these were valiant warriors .
7:20:045:0	The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , but they caught 5 , 000 of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and killed 2 , 000 of them .
7:20:046:0	So all of Benjamin who fell that day were 25 , 000 men who draw the sword ; all these were valiant warriors .
7:20:047:0	But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months .
7:20:048:0	The men of Israel then turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city with the cattle and all that they found ; they also set on fire all the cities which they found .
