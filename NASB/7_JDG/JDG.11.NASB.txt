7:11:001:1	Jephthah the Ninth Judge
7:11:001:0	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior , but he was the son of a harlot . And Gilead was the father of Jephthah .
7:11:002:0	Gilead’s wife bore him sons ; and when his wife’s sons grew up , they drove Jephthah out and said to him , “ You shall not have an inheritance in our father’s house , for you are the son of another woman . ”
7:11:003:0	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob ; and worthless fellows gathered themselves about Jephthah , and they went out with him .
7:11:004:0	It came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel .
7:11:005:0	When the sons of Ammon fought against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob ;
7:11:006:0	and they said to Jephthah , “ Come and be our chief that we may fight against the sons of Ammon . ”
7:11:007:0	Then Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , “ Did you not hate me and drive me from my father’s house ? So why have you come to me now when you are in trouble ? ”
7:11:008:0	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , “ For this reason we have now returned to you , that you may go with us and fight with the sons of Ammon and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead . ”
7:11:009:0	So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , “ If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon and the Lord gives them up to me , will I become your head ? ”
7:11:010:0	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , “ The Lord is witness between us ; surely we will do as you have said . ”
7:11:011:0	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and chief over them ; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord at Mizpah .
7:11:012:0	Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon , saying , “ What is between you and me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? ”
7:11:013:0	The king of the sons of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah , “ Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt , from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and the Jordan ; therefore , return them peaceably now . ”
7:11:014:0	But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon ,
7:11:015:0	and they said to him , “ Thus says Jephthah , ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab nor the land of the sons of Ammon .
7:11:016:0	For when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh ,
7:11:017:0	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , “ Please let us pass through your land , ” but the king of Edom would not listen . And they also sent to the king of Moab , but he would not consent . So Israel remained at Kadesh .
7:11:018:0	Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab , and came to the east side of the land of Moab , and they camped beyond the Arnon ; but they did not enter the territory of Moab , for the Arnon was the border of Moab .
7:11:019:0	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon , and Israel said to him , “ Please let us pass through your land to our place . ”
7:11:020:0	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory ; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz and fought with Israel .
7:11:021:0	The Lord , the God of Israel , gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they defeated them ; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
7:11:022:0	So they possessed all the territory of the Amorites , from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok , and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan .
7:11:023:0	Since now the Lord , the God of Israel , drove out the Amorites from before His people Israel , are you then to possess it ?
7:11:024:0	Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess ? So whatever the Lord our God has driven out before us , we will possess it .
7:11:025:0	Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever strive with Israel , or did he ever fight against them ?
7:11:026:0	While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages , and in Aroer and its villages , and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon , three hundred years , why did you not recover them within that time ?
7:11:027:0	I therefore have not sinned against you , but you are doing me wrong by making war against me ; may the Lord , the Judge , judge today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon . ’ ”
7:11:002:1	Jephthah’s Tragic Vow
7:11:028:0	But the king of the sons of Ammon disregarded the message which Jephthah sent him .
7:11:029:0	Now the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , so that he passed through Gilead and Manasseh ; then he passed through Mizpah of Gilead , and from Mizpah of Gilead he went on to the sons of Ammon .
7:11:030:0	Jephthah made a vow to the Lord and said , “ If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand ,
7:11:031:0	then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon , it shall be the Lord’s , and I will offer it up as a burnt offering . ”
7:11:032:0	So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them ; and the Lord gave them into his hand .
7:11:033:0	He struck them with a very great slaughter from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith , twenty cities , and as far as Abel-keramim . So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel .
7:11:034:0	When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah , behold , his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing . Now she was his one and only child ; besides her he had no son or daughter .
7:11:035:0	When he saw her , he tore his clothes and said , “ Alas , my daughter ! You have brought me very low , and you are among those who trouble me ; for I have given my word to the Lord , and I cannot take it back . ”
7:11:036:0	So she said to him , “ My father , you have given your word to the Lord ; do to me as you have said , since the Lord has avenged you of your enemies , the sons of Ammon . ”
7:11:037:0	She said to her father , “ Let this thing be done for me ; let me alone two months , that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity , I and my companions . ”
7:11:038:0	Then he said , “ Go . ” So he sent her away for two months ; and she left with her companions , and wept on the mountains because of her virginity .
7:11:039:0	At the end of two months she returned to her father , who did to her according to the vow which he had made ; and she had no relations with a man . Thus it became a custom in Israel ,
7:11:040:0	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year .
