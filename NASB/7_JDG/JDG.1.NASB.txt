7:1:001:1	Jerusalem Is Captured
7:1:001:0	Now it came about after the death of Joshua that the sons of Israel inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites , to fight against them ? ”
7:1:002:0	The Lord said , “ Judah shall go up ; behold , I have given the land into his hand . ”
7:1:003:0	Then Judah said to Simeon his brother , “ Come up with me into the territory allotted me , that we may fight against the Canaanites ; and I in turn will go with you into the territory allotted you . ” So Simeon went with him .
7:1:004:0	Judah went up , and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands , and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek .
7:1:005:0	They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him , and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
7:1:006:0	But Adoni-bezek fled ; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes .
7:1:007:0	Adoni-bezek said , “ Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to gather up scraps under my table ; as I have done , so God has repaid me . ” So they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there .
7:1:008:0	Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire .
7:1:009:0	Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country and in the Negev and in the lowland .
7:1:002:1	Capture of Other Cities
7:1:010:0	So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron ( now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba ) ; and they struck Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai .
7:1:011:0	Then from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir ( now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher ) .
7:1:012:0	And Caleb said , “ The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it , I will even give him my daughter Achsah for a wife . ”
7:1:013:0	Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb’s younger brother , captured it ; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for a wife .
7:1:014:0	Then it came about when she came to him , that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field . Then she alighted from her donkey , and Caleb said to her , “ What do you want ? ”
7:1:015:0	She said to him , “ Give me a blessing , since you have given me the land of the Negev , give me also springs of water . ” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
7:1:016:0	The descendants of the Kenite , Moses’ father-in-law , went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah , to the wilderness of Judah which is in the south of Arad ; and they went and lived with the people .
7:1:017:0	Then Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath , and utterly destroyed it . So the name of the city was called Hormah .
7:1:018:0	And Judah took Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory .
7:1:019:0	Now the Lord was with Judah , and they took possession of the hill country ; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots .
7:1:020:0	Then they gave Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had promised ; and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak .
7:1:021:0	But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem ; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
7:1:022:0	Likewise the house of Joseph went up against Bethel , and the Lord was with them .
7:1:023:0	The house of Joseph spied out Bethel ( now the name of the city was formerly Luz ) .
7:1:024:0	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him , “ Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly . ”
7:1:025:0	So he showed them the entrance to the city , and they struck the city with the edge of the sword , but they let the man and all his family go free .
7:1:003:1	Places Not Conquered
7:1:026:0	The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz which is its name to this day .
7:1:027:0	But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages , or Taanach and its villages , or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages , or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages , or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages ; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land .
7:1:028:0	It came about when Israel became strong , that they put the Canaanites to forced labor , but they did not drive them out completely .
7:1:029:0	Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer ; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them .
7:1:030:0	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , or the inhabitants of Nahalol ; so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor .
7:1:031:0	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco , or the inhabitants of Sidon , or of Ahlab , or of Achzib , or of Helbah , or of Aphik , or of Rehob .
7:1:032:0	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
7:1:033:0	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh , or the inhabitants of Beth-anath , but lived among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them .
7:1:034:0	Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country , for they did not allow them to come down to the valley ;
7:1:035:0	yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres , in Aijalon and in Shaalbim ; but when the power of the house of Joseph grew strong , they became forced labor .
7:1:036:0	The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim , from Sela and upward .
