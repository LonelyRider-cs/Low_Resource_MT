7:15:001:1	Samson Burns Philistine Crops
7:15:001:0	But after a while , in the time of wheat harvest , Samson visited his wife with a young goat , and said , “ I will go in to my wife in her room . ” But her father did not let him enter .
7:15:002:0	Her father said , “ I really thought that you hated her intensely ; so I gave her to your companion . Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she ? Please let her be yours instead . ”
7:15:003:0	Samson then said to them , “ This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm . ”
7:15:004:0	Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took torches , and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in the middle between two tails .
7:15:005:0	When he had set fire to the torches , he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines , thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain , along with the vineyards and groves .
7:15:006:0	Then the Philistines said , “ Who did this ? ” And they said , “ Samson , the son-in-law of the Timnite , because he took his wife and gave her to his companion . ” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire .
7:15:007:0	Samson said to them , “ Since you act like this , I will surely take revenge on you , but after that I will quit . ”
7:15:008:0	He struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter ; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam .
7:15:009:0	Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah , and spread out in Lehi .
7:15:010:0	The men of Judah said , “ Why have you come up against us ? ” And they said , “ We have come up to bind Samson in order to do to him as he did to us . ”
7:15:011:0	Then 3 , 000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson , “ Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us ? What then is this that you have done to us ? ” And he said to them , “ As they did to me , so I have done to them . ”
7:15:012:0	They said to him , “ We have come down to bind you so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines . ” And Samson said to them , “ Swear to me that you will not kill me . ”
7:15:013:0	So they said to him , “ No , but we will bind you fast and give you into their hands ; yet surely we will not kill you . ” Then they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock .
7:15:014:0	When he came to Lehi , the Philistines shouted as they met him . And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire , and his bonds dropped from his hands .
7:15:015:0	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it .
7:15:016:0	Then Samson said , “ With the jawbone of a donkey , Heaps upon heaps , With the jawbone of a donkeyI have killed a thousand men . ”
7:15:017:0	When he had finished speaking , he threw the jawbone from his hand ; and he named that place Ramath-lehi .
7:15:018:0	Then he became very thirsty , and he called to the Lord and said , “ You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant , and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised ? ”
7:15:019:0	But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi so that water came out of it . When he drank , his strength returned and he revived . Therefore he named it En-hakkore , which is in Lehi to this day .
7:15:020:0	So he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines .
