50:2:001:1	Be Like Christ
50:2:001:0	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ , if there is any consolation of love , if there is any fellowship of the Spirit , if any affection and compassion ,
50:2:002:0	make my joy complete by being of the same mind , maintaining the same love , united in spirit , intent on one purpose .
50:2:003:0	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit , but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves ;
50:2:004:0	do not merely look out for your own personal interests , but also for the interests of others .
50:2:005:0	Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus ,
50:2:006:0	who , although He existed in the form of God , did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped ,
50:2:007:0	but emptied Himself , taking the form of a bond-servant , and being made in the likeness of men .
50:2:008:0	Being found in appearance as a man , He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death , even death on a cross .
50:2:009:0	For this reason also , God highly exalted Him , and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name ,
50:2:010:0	so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow , of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
50:2:011:0	and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50:2:012:0	So then , my beloved , just as you have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your salvation with fear and trembling ;
50:2:013:0	for it is God who is at work in you , both to will and to work for His good pleasure .
50:2:014:0	Do all things without grumbling or disputing ;
50:2:015:0	so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent , children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you appear as lights in the world ,
50:2:016:0	holding fast the word of life , so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain .
50:2:017:0	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice and share my joy with you all .
50:2:002:1	Timothy and Epaphroditus
50:2:018:0	You too , I urge you , rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me .
50:2:019:0	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly , so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition .
50:2:020:0	For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare .
50:2:021:0	For they all seek after their own interests , not those of Christ Jesus .
50:2:022:0	But you know of his proven worth , that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father .
50:2:023:0	Therefore I hope to send him immediately , as soon as I see how things go with me ;
50:2:024:0	and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly .
50:2:025:0	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier , who is also your messenger and minister to my need ;
50:2:026:0	because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick .
50:2:027:0	For indeed he was sick to the point of death , but God had mercy on him , and not on him only but also on me , so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow .
50:2:028:0	Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you .
50:2:029:0	Receive him then in the Lord with all joy , and hold men like him in high regard ;
50:2:030:0	because he came close to death for the work of Christ , risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me .
