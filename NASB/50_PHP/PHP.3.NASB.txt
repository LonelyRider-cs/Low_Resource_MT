50:3:001:1	The Goal of Life
50:3:001:0	Finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things again is no trouble to me , and it is a safeguard for you .
50:3:002:0	Beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of the false circumcision ;
50:3:003:0	for we are the true circumcision , who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh ,
50:3:004:0	although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh , I far more :
50:3:005:0	circumcised the eighth day , of the nation of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; as to the Law , a Pharisee ;
50:3:006:0	as to zeal , a persecutor of the church ; as to the righteousness which is in the Law , found blameless .
50:3:007:0	But whatever things were gain to me , those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ .
50:3:008:0	More than that , I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord , for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ ,
50:3:009:0	and may be found in Him , not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith ,
50:3:010:0	that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings , being conformed to His death ;
50:3:011:0	in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead .
50:3:012:0	Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect , but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus .
50:3:013:0	Brethren , I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet ; but one thing I do : forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead ,
50:3:014:0	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus .
50:3:015:0	Let us therefore , as many as are perfect , have this attitude ; and if in anything you have a different attitude , God will reveal that also to you ;
50:3:016:0	however , let us keep living by that same standard to which we have attained .
50:3:017:0	Brethren , join in following my example , and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us .
50:3:018:0	For many walk , of whom I often told you , and now tell you even weeping , that they are enemies of the cross of Christ ,
50:3:019:0	whose end is destruction , whose god is their appetite , and whose glory is in their shame , who set their minds on earthly things .
50:3:020:0	For our citizenship is in heaven , from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
50:3:021:0	who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory , by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself .
