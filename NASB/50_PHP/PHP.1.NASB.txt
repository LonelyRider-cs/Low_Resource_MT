50:1:001:1	Thanksgiving
50:1:001:0	Paul and Timothy , bond-servants of Christ Jesus , To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , including the overseers and deacons :
50:1:002:0	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50:1:003:0	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you ,
50:1:004:0	always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all ,
50:1:005:0	in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now .
50:1:006:0	For I am confident of this very thing , that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus .
50:1:007:0	For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all , because I have you in my heart , since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel , you all are partakers of grace with me .
50:1:008:0	For God is my witness , how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus .
50:1:009:0	And this I pray , that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment ,
50:1:010:0	so that you may approve the things that are excellent , in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ ;
50:1:002:1	The Gospel Is Preached
50:1:011:0	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God .
50:1:012:0	Now I want you to know , brethren , that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel ,
50:1:013:0	so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else ,
50:1:014:0	and that most of the brethren , trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment , have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear .
50:1:015:0	Some , to be sure , are preaching Christ even from envy and strife , but some also from good will ;
50:1:016:0	the latter do it out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel ;
50:1:017:0	the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives , thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment .
50:1:018:0	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed ; and in this I rejoice . Yes , and I will rejoice ,
50:1:019:0	for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
50:1:003:1	To Live Is Christ
50:1:020:0	according to my earnest expectation and hope , that I will not be put to shame in anything , but that with all boldness , Christ will even now , as always , be exalted in my body , whether by life or by death .
50:1:021:0	For to me , to live is Christ and to die is gain .
50:1:022:0	But if I am to live on in the flesh , this will mean fruitful labor for me ; and I do not know which to choose .
50:1:023:0	But I am hard-pressed from both directions , having the desire to depart and be with Christ , for that is very much better ;
50:1:024:0	yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake .
50:1:025:0	Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith ,
50:1:026:0	so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again .
50:1:027:0	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or remain absent , I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
50:1:028:0	in no way alarmed by your opponents—which is a sign of destruction for them , but of salvation for you , and that too , from God .
50:1:029:0	For to you it has been granted for Christ’s sake , not only to believe in Him , but also to suffer for His sake ,
50:1:030:0	experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
