50:4:001:1	Think of Excellence
50:4:001:0	Therefore , my beloved brethren whom I long to see , my joy and crown , in this way stand firm in the Lord , my beloved .
50:4:002:0	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord .
50:4:003:0	Indeed , true companion , I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel , together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
50:4:004:0	Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say , rejoice !
50:4:005:0	Let your gentle spirit be known to all men . The Lord is near .
50:4:006:0	Be anxious for nothing , but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .
50:4:007:0	And the peace of God , which surpasses all comprehension , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
50:4:008:0	Finally , brethren , whatever is true , whatever is honorable , whatever is right , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is of good repute , if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise , dwell on these things .
50:4:002:1	God’s Provisions
50:4:009:0	The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me , practice these things , and the God of peace will be with you .
50:4:010:0	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at last you have revived your concern for me ; indeed , you were concerned before , but you lacked opportunity .
50:4:011:0	Not that I speak from want , for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am .
50:4:012:0	I know how to get along with humble means , and I also know how to live in prosperity ; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry , both of having abundance and suffering need .
50:4:013:0	I can do all things through Him who strengthens me .
50:4:014:0	Nevertheless , you have done well to share with me in my affliction .
50:4:015:0	You yourselves also know , Philippians , that at the first preaching of the gospel , after I left Macedonia , no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone ;
50:4:016:0	for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs .
50:4:017:0	Not that I seek the gift itself , but I seek for the profit which increases to your account .
50:4:018:0	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance ; I am amply supplied , having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent , a fragrant aroma , an acceptable sacrifice , well-pleasing to God .
50:4:019:0	And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
50:4:020:0	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
50:4:021:0	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren who are with me greet you .
50:4:022:0	All the saints greet you , especially those of Caesar’s household .
50:4:023:0	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
