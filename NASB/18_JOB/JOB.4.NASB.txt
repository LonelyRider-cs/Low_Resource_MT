18:4:001:1	Eliphaz : Innocent Do Not Suffer
18:4:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered ,
18:4:002:0	“ If one ventures a word with you , will you become impatient ? But who can refrain from speaking ?
18:4:003:0	Behold you have admonished many , And you have strengthened weak hands .
18:4:004:0	Your words have helped the tottering to stand , And you have strengthened feeble knees .
18:4:005:0	But now it has come to you , and you are impatient ; It touches you , and you are dismayed .
18:4:006:0	Is not your fear of God your confidence , And the integrity of your ways your hope ?
18:4:007:0	“ Remember now , who ever perished being innocent ? Or where were the upright destroyed ?
18:4:008:0	According to what I have seen , those who plow iniquityAnd those who sow trouble harvest it .
18:4:009:0	By the breath of God they perish , And by the blast of His anger they come to an end .
18:4:010:0	The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion , And the teeth of the young lions are broken .
18:4:011:0	The lion perishes for lack of prey , And the whelps of the lioness are scattered .
18:4:012:0	“ Now a word was brought to me stealthily , And my ear received a whisper of it .
18:4:013:0	Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night , When deep sleep falls on men ,
18:4:014:0	Dread came upon me , and trembling , And made all my bones shake .
18:4:015:0	Then a spirit passed by my face ; The hair of my flesh bristled up .
18:4:016:0	It stood still , but I could not discern its appearance ; A form was before my eyes ; There was silence , then I heard a voice :
18:4:017:0	‘Can mankind be just before God ? Can a man be pure before his Maker ?
18:4:018:0	He puts no trust even in His servants ; And against His angels He charges error .
18:4:019:0	How much more those who dwell in houses of clay , Whose foundation is in the dust , Who are crushed before the moth !
18:4:020:0	Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces ; Unobserved , they perish forever .
18:4:021:0	Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them ? They die , yet without wisdom . ’
