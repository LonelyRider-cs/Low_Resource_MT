18:26:001:1	Job Rebukes Bildad
18:26:001:0	Then Job responded ,
18:26:002:0	“ What a help you are to the weak ! How you have saved the arm without strength !
18:26:003:0	What counsel you have given to one without wisdom ! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided !
18:26:002:1	The Greatness of God
18:26:004:0	To whom have you uttered words ? And whose spirit was expressed through you ?
18:26:005:0	“ The departed spirits trembleUnder the waters and their inhabitants .
18:26:006:0	Naked is Sheol before Him , And Abaddon has no covering .
18:26:007:0	He stretches out the north over empty spaceAnd hangs the earth on nothing .
18:26:008:0	He wraps up the waters in His clouds , And the cloud does not burst under them .
18:26:009:0	He obscures the face of the full moonAnd spreads His cloud over it .
18:26:010:0	He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the watersAt the boundary of light and darkness .
18:26:011:0	The pillars of heaven trembleAnd are amazed at His rebuke .
18:26:012:0	He quieted the sea with His power , And by His understanding He shattered Rahab .
18:26:013:0	By His breath the heavens are cleared ; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent .
18:26:014:0	Behold , these are the fringes of His ways ; And how faint a word we hear of Him ! But His mighty thunder , who can understand ? ”
