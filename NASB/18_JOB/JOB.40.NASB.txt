18:40:001:1	Job : What Can I Say ?
18:40:001:0	Then the Lord said to Job ,
18:40:002:0	“ Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty ? Let him who reproves God answer it . ”
18:40:003:0	Then Job answered the Lord and said ,
18:40:004:0	“ Behold , I am insignificant ; what can I reply to You ? I lay my hand on my mouth .
18:40:002:1	God Questions Job
18:40:005:0	Once I have spoken , and I will not answer ; Even twice , and I will add nothing more . ”
18:40:006:0	Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm and said ,
18:40:007:0	“ Now gird up your loins like a man ; I will ask you , and you instruct Me .
18:40:008:0	Will you really annul My judgment ? Will you condemn Me that you may be justified ?
18:40:009:0	Or do you have an arm like God , And can you thunder with a voice like His ?
18:40:010:0	“ Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity , And clothe yourself with honor and majesty .
18:40:011:0	Pour out the overflowings of your anger , And look on everyone who is proud , and make him low .
18:40:012:0	Look on everyone who is proud , and humble him , And tread down the wicked where they stand .
18:40:013:0	Hide them in the dust together ; Bind them in the hidden place .
18:40:003:1	God’s Power Shown in Creatures
18:40:014:0	Then I will also confess to you , That your own right hand can save you .
18:40:015:0	“ Behold now , Behemoth , which I made as well as you ; He eats grass like an ox .
18:40:016:0	Behold now , his strength in his loinsAnd his power in the muscles of his belly .
18:40:017:0	He bends his tail like a cedar ; The sinews of his thighs are knit together .
18:40:018:0	His bones are tubes of bronze ; His limbs are like bars of iron .
18:40:019:0	“ He is the first of the ways of God ; Let his maker bring near his sword .
18:40:020:0	Surely the mountains bring him food , And all the beasts of the field play there .
18:40:021:0	Under the lotus plants he lies down , In the covert of the reeds and the marsh .
18:40:022:0	The lotus plants cover him with shade ; The willows of the brook surround him .
18:40:023:0	If a river rages , he is not alarmed ; He is confident , though the Jordan rushes to his mouth .
18:40:024:0	Can anyone capture him when he is on watch , With barbs can anyone pierce his nose ?
