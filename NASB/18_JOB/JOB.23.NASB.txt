18:23:001:1	Job Says He Longs for God
18:23:001:0	Then Job replied ,
18:23:002:0	“ Even today my complaint is rebellion ; His hand is heavy despite my groaning .
18:23:003:0	Oh that I knew where I might find Him , That I might come to His seat !
18:23:004:0	I would present my case before HimAnd fill my mouth with arguments .
18:23:005:0	I would learn the words which He would answer , And perceive what He would say to me .
18:23:006:0	Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power ? No , surely He would pay attention to me .
18:23:007:0	There the upright would reason with Him ; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge .
18:23:008:0	“ Behold , I go forward but He is not there , And backward , but I cannot perceive Him ;
18:23:009:0	When He acts on the left , I cannot behold Him ; He turns on the right , I cannot see Him .
18:23:010:0	But He knows the way I take ; When He has tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
18:23:011:0	My foot has held fast to His path ; I have kept His way and not turned aside .
18:23:012:0	I have not departed from the command of His lips ; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food .
18:23:013:0	But He is unique and who can turn Him ? And what His soul desires , that He does .
18:23:014:0	For He performs what is appointed for me , And many such decrees are with Him .
18:23:015:0	Therefore , I would be dismayed at His presence ; When I consider , I am terrified of Him .
18:23:016:0	It is God who has made my heart faint , And the Almighty who has dismayed me ,
18:23:017:0	But I am not silenced by the darkness , Nor deep gloom which covers me .
