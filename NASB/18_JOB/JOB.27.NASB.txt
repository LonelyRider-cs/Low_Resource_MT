18:27:001:1	Job Affirms His Righteousness
18:27:001:0	Then Job continued his discourse and said ,
18:27:002:0	“ As God lives , who has taken away my right , And the Almighty , who has embittered my soul ,
18:27:003:0	For as long as life is in me , And the breath of God is in my nostrils ,
18:27:004:0	My lips certainly will not speak unjustly , Nor will my tongue mutter deceit .
18:27:005:0	Far be it from me that I should declare you right ; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me .
18:27:002:1	The State of the Godless
18:27:006:0	I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go . My heart does not reproach any of my days .
18:27:007:0	“ May my enemy be as the wickedAnd my opponent as the unjust .
18:27:008:0	For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off , When God requires his life ?
18:27:009:0	Will God hear his cryWhen distress comes upon him ?
18:27:010:0	Will he take delight in the Almighty ? Will he call on God at all times ?
18:27:011:0	I will instruct you in the power of God ; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal .
18:27:012:0	Behold , all of you have seen it ; Why then do you act foolishly ?
18:27:013:0	“ This is the portion of a wicked man from God , And the inheritance which tyrants receive from the Almighty .
18:27:014:0	Though his sons are many , they are destined for the sword ; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread .
18:27:015:0	His survivors will be buried because of the plague , And their widows will not be able to weep .
18:27:016:0	Though he piles up silver like dustAnd prepares garments as plentiful as the clay ,
18:27:017:0	He may prepare it , but the just will wear itAnd the innocent will divide the silver .
18:27:018:0	He has built his house like the spider’s web , Or as a hut which the watchman has made .
18:27:019:0	He lies down rich , but never again ; He opens his eyes , and it is no longer .
18:27:020:0	Terrors overtake him like a flood ; A tempest steals him away in the night .
18:27:021:0	The east wind carries him away , and he is gone , For it whirls him away from his place .
18:27:022:0	For it will hurl at him without sparing ; He will surely try to flee from its power .
18:27:023:0	Men will clap their hands at himAnd will hiss him from his place .
