18:18:001:1	Bildad Speaks of the Wicked
18:18:001:0	Then Bildad the Shuhite responded ,
18:18:002:0	“ How long will you hunt for words ? Show understanding and then we can talk .
18:18:003:0	Why are we regarded as beasts , As stupid in your eyes ?
18:18:004:0	O you who tear yourself in your anger—For your sake is the earth to be abandoned , Or the rock to be moved from its place ?
18:18:005:0	“ Indeed , the light of the wicked goes out , And the flame of his fire gives no light .
18:18:006:0	The light in his tent is darkened , And his lamp goes out above him .
18:18:007:0	His vigorous stride is shortened , And his own scheme brings him down .
18:18:008:0	For he is thrown into the net by his own feet , And he steps on the webbing .
18:18:009:0	A snare seizes him by the heel , And a trap snaps shut on him .
18:18:010:0	A noose for him is hidden in the ground , And a trap for him on the path .
18:18:011:0	All around terrors frighten him , And harry him at every step .
18:18:012:0	His strength is famished , And calamity is ready at his side .
18:18:013:0	His skin is devoured by disease , The firstborn of death devours his limbs .
18:18:014:0	He is torn from the security of his tent , And they march him before the king of terrors .
18:18:015:0	There dwells in his tent nothing of his ; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation .
18:18:016:0	His roots are dried below , And his branch is cut off above .
18:18:017:0	Memory of him perishes from the earth , And he has no name abroad .
18:18:018:0	He is driven from light into darkness , And chased from the inhabited world .
18:18:019:0	He has no offspring or posterity among his people , Nor any survivor where he sojourned .
18:18:020:0	Those in the west are appalled at his fate , And those in the east are seized with horror .
18:18:021:0	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked , And this is the place of him who does not know God . ”
