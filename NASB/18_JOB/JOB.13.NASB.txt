18:13:001:1	Job Says His Friends’ Proverbs Are Ashes
18:13:001:0	“ Behold , my eye has seen all this , My ear has heard and understood it .
18:13:002:0	What you know I also know ; I am not inferior to you .
18:13:003:0	“ But I would speak to the Almighty , And I desire to argue with God .
18:13:004:0	But you smear with lies ; You are all worthless physicians .
18:13:005:0	O that you would be completely silent , And that it would become your wisdom !
18:13:006:0	Please hear my argumentAnd listen to the contentions of my lips .
18:13:007:0	Will you speak what is unjust for God , And speak what is deceitful for Him ?
18:13:008:0	Will you show partiality for Him ? Will you contend for God ?
18:13:009:0	Will it be well when He examines you ? Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man ?
18:13:010:0	He will surely reprove youIf you secretly show partiality .
18:13:011:0	Will not His majesty terrify you , And the dread of Him fall on you ?
18:13:002:1	Job Is Sure He Will Be Vindicated
18:13:012:0	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes , Your defenses are defenses of clay .
18:13:013:0	“ Be silent before me so that I may speak ; Then let come on me what may .
18:13:014:0	Why should I take my flesh in my teethAnd put my life in my hands ?
18:13:015:0	Though He slay me , I will hope in Him . Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him .
18:13:016:0	This also will be my salvation , For a godless man may not come before His presence .
18:13:017:0	Listen carefully to my speech , And let my declaration fill your ears .
18:13:018:0	Behold now , I have prepared my case ; I know that I will be vindicated .
18:13:019:0	Who will contend with me ? For then I would be silent and die .
18:13:020:0	“ Only two things do not do to me , Then I will not hide from Your face :
18:13:021:0	Remove Your hand from me , And let not the dread of You terrify me .
18:13:022:0	Then call , and I will answer ; Or let me speak , then reply to me .
18:13:023:0	How many are my iniquities and sins ? Make known to me my rebellion and my sin .
18:13:024:0	Why do You hide Your faceAnd consider me Your enemy ?
18:13:025:0	Will You cause a driven leaf to tremble ? Or will You pursue the dry chaff ?
18:13:026:0	For You write bitter things against meAnd make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth .
18:13:027:0	You put my feet in the stocksAnd watch all my paths ; You set a limit for the soles of my feet ,
18:13:028:0	While I am decaying like a rotten thing , Like a garment that is moth-eaten .
