18:8:001:1	Bildad Says God Rewards the Good
18:8:001:0	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered ,
18:8:002:0	“ How long will you say these things , And the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
18:8:003:0	Does God pervert justice ? Or does the Almighty pervert what is right ?
18:8:004:0	If your sons sinned against Him , Then He delivered them into the power of their transgression .
18:8:005:0	If you would seek GodAnd implore the compassion of the Almighty ,
18:8:006:0	If you are pure and upright , Surely now He would rouse Himself for youAnd restore your righteous estate .
18:8:007:0	Though your beginning was insignificant , Yet your end will increase greatly .
18:8:008:0	“ Please inquire of past generations , And consider the things searched out by their fathers .
18:8:009:0	For we are only of yesterday and know nothing , Because our days on earth are as a shadow .
18:8:010:0	Will they not teach you and tell you , And bring forth words from their minds ?
18:8:011:0	“ Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh ? Can the rushes grow without water ?
18:8:012:0	While it is still green and not cut down , Yet it withers before any other plant .
18:8:013:0	So are the paths of all who forget God ; And the hope of the godless will perish ,
18:8:014:0	Whose confidence is fragile , And whose trust a spider’s web .
18:8:015:0	He trusts in his house , but it does not stand ; He holds fast to it , but it does not endure .
18:8:016:0	He thrives before the sun , And his shoots spread out over his garden .
18:8:017:0	His roots wrap around a rock pile , He grasps a house of stones .
18:8:018:0	If he is removed from his place , Then it will deny him , saying , ‘I never saw you . ’
18:8:019:0	Behold , this is the joy of His way ; And out of the dust others will spring .
18:8:020:0	Lo , God will not reject a man of integrity , Nor will He support the evildoers .
18:8:021:0	He will yet fill your mouth with laughterAnd your lips with shouting .
18:8:022:0	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame , And the tent of the wicked will be no longer . ”
