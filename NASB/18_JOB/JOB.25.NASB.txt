18:25:001:1	Bildad Says Man Is Inferior
18:25:001:0	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered ,
18:25:002:0	“ Dominion and awe belong to HimWho establishes peace in His heights .
18:25:003:0	Is there any number to His troops ? And upon whom does His light not rise ?
18:25:004:0	How then can a man be just with God ? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman ?
18:25:005:0	If even the moon has no brightnessAnd the stars are not pure in His sight ,
18:25:006:0	How much less man , that maggot , And the son of man , that worm ! ”
