18:19:001:1	Job Feels Insulted
18:19:001:0	Then Job responded ,
18:19:002:0	“ How long will you torment meAnd crush me with words ?
18:19:003:0	These ten times you have insulted me ; You are not ashamed to wrong me .
18:19:004:0	Even if I have truly erred , My error lodges with me .
18:19:005:0	If indeed you vaunt yourselves against meAnd prove my disgrace to me ,
18:19:002:1	Everything Is against Him
18:19:006:0	Know then that God has wronged meAnd has closed His net around me .
18:19:007:0	“ Behold , I cry , ‘Violence ! ’ but I get no answer ; I shout for help , but there is no justice .
18:19:008:0	He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass , And He has put darkness on my paths .
18:19:009:0	He has stripped my honor from meAnd removed the crown from my head .
18:19:010:0	He breaks me down on every side , and I am gone ; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree .
18:19:011:0	He has also kindled His anger against meAnd considered me as His enemy .
18:19:012:0	His troops come together , And build up their way against meAnd camp around my tent .
18:19:013:0	“ He has removed my brothers far from me , And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me .
18:19:014:0	My relatives have failed , And my intimate friends have forgotten me .
18:19:015:0	Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger . I am a foreigner in their sight .
18:19:016:0	I call to my servant , but he does not answer ; I have to implore him with my mouth .
18:19:017:0	My breath is offensive to my wife , And I am loathsome to my own brothers .
18:19:018:0	Even young children despise me ; I rise up and they speak against me .
18:19:019:0	All my associates abhor me , And those I love have turned against me .
18:19:020:0	My bone clings to my skin and my flesh , And I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth .
18:19:021:0	Pity me , pity me , O you my friends , For the hand of God has struck me .
18:19:003:1	Job Says , “ My Redeemer Lives ”
18:19:022:0	Why do you persecute me as God does , And are not satisfied with my flesh ?
18:19:023:0	“ Oh that my words were written ! Oh that they were inscribed in a book !
18:19:024:0	That with an iron stylus and leadThey were engraved in the rock forever !
18:19:025:0	As for me , I know that my Redeemer lives , And at the last He will take His stand on the earth .
18:19:026:0	Even after my skin is destroyed , Yet from my flesh I shall see God ;
18:19:027:0	Whom I myself shall behold , And whom my eyes will see and not another . My heart faints within me !
18:19:028:0	If you say , ‘How shall we persecute him ? ’And ‘What pretext for a case against him can we find ? ’
18:19:029:0	Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves , For wrath brings the punishment of the sword , So that you may know there is judgment . ”
