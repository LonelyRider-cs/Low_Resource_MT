18:28:001:1	Job Tells of Earth’s Treasures
18:28:001:0	“ Surely there is a mine for silverAnd a place where they refine gold .
18:28:002:0	Iron is taken from the dust , And copper is smelted from rock .
18:28:003:0	Man puts an end to darkness , And to the farthest limit he searches outThe rock in gloom and deep shadow .
18:28:004:0	He sinks a shaft far from habitation , Forgotten by the foot ; They hang and swing to and fro far from men .
18:28:005:0	The earth , from it comes food , And underneath it is turned up as fire .
18:28:006:0	Its rocks are the source of sapphires , And its dust contains gold .
18:28:007:0	The path no bird of prey knows , Nor has the falcon’s eye caught sight of it .
18:28:008:0	The proud beasts have not trodden it , Nor has the fierce lion passed over it .
18:28:009:0	He puts his hand on the flint ; He overturns the mountains at the base .
18:28:010:0	He hews out channels through the rocks , And his eye sees anything precious .
18:28:002:1	The Search for Wisdom Is Harder
18:28:011:0	He dams up the streams from flowing , And what is hidden he brings out to the light .
18:28:012:0	“ But where can wisdom be found ? And where is the place of understanding ?
18:28:013:0	Man does not know its value , Nor is it found in the land of the living .
18:28:014:0	The deep says , ‘It is not in me’ ; And the sea says , ‘It is not with me . ’
18:28:015:0	Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it , Nor can silver be weighed as its price .
18:28:016:0	It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir , In precious onyx , or sapphire .
18:28:017:0	Gold or glass cannot equal it , Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold .
18:28:018:0	Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned ; And the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls .
18:28:019:0	The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it , Nor can it be valued in pure gold .
18:28:020:0	Where then does wisdom come from ? And where is the place of understanding ?
18:28:021:0	Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all livingAnd concealed from the birds of the sky .
18:28:022:0	Abaddon and Death say , ‘With our ears we have heard a report of it . ’
18:28:023:0	“ God understands its way , And He knows its place .
18:28:024:0	For He looks to the ends of the earthAnd sees everything under the heavens .
18:28:025:0	When He imparted weight to the windAnd meted out the waters by measure ,
18:28:026:0	When He set a limit for the rainAnd a course for the thunderbolt ,
18:28:027:0	Then He saw it and declared it ; He established it and also searched it out .
18:28:028:0	And to man He said , ‘Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom ; And to depart from evil is understanding . ’ ”
