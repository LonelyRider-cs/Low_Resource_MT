18:20:001:1	Zophar Says , “ The Triumph of the Wicked Is Short ”
18:20:001:0	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered ,
18:20:002:0	“ Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond , Even because of my inward agitation .
18:20:003:0	I listened to the reproof which insults me , And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer .
18:20:004:0	Do you know this from of old , From the establishment of man on earth ,
18:20:005:0	That the triumphing of the wicked is short , And the joy of the godless momentary ?
18:20:006:0	Though his loftiness reaches the heavens , And his head touches the clouds ,
18:20:007:0	He perishes forever like his refuse ; Those who have seen him will say , ‘Where is he ? ’
18:20:008:0	He flies away like a dream , and they cannot find him ; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away .
18:20:009:0	The eye which saw him sees him no longer , And his place no longer beholds him .
18:20:010:0	His sons favor the poor , And his hands give back his wealth .
18:20:011:0	His bones are full of his youthful vigor , But it lies down with him in the dust .
18:20:012:0	“ Though evil is sweet in his mouth And he hides it under his tongue ,
18:20:013:0	Though he desires it and will not let it go , But holds it in his mouth ,
18:20:014:0	Yet his food in his stomach is changedTo the venom of cobras within him .
18:20:015:0	He swallows riches , But will vomit them up ; God will expel them from his belly .
18:20:016:0	He sucks the poison of cobras ; The viper’s tongue slays him .
18:20:017:0	He does not look at the streams , The rivers flowing with honey and curds .
18:20:018:0	He returns what he has attainedAnd cannot swallow it ; As to the riches of his trading , He cannot even enjoy them .
18:20:019:0	For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor ; He has seized a house which he has not built .
18:20:020:0	“ Because he knew no quiet within him , He does not retain anything he desires .
18:20:021:0	Nothing remains for him to devour , Therefore his prosperity does not endure .
18:20:022:0	In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped ; The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him .
18:20:023:0	When he fills his belly , God will send His fierce anger on himAnd will rain it on him while he is eating .
18:20:024:0	He may flee from the iron weapon , But the bronze bow will pierce him .
18:20:025:0	It is drawn forth and comes out of his back , Even the glittering point from his gall . Terrors come upon him ,
18:20:026:0	Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures , And unfanned fire will devour him ; It will consume the survivor in his tent .
18:20:027:0	The heavens will reveal his iniquity , And the earth will rise up against him .
18:20:028:0	The increase of his house will depart ; His possessions will flow away in the day of His anger .
18:20:029:0	This is the wicked man’s portion from God , Even the heritage decreed to him by God . ”
