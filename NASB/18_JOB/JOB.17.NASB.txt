18:17:001:1	Job Says He Has Become a Byword
18:17:001:0	“ My spirit is broken , my days are extinguished , The grave is ready for me .
18:17:002:0	Surely mockers are with me , And my eye gazes on their provocation .
18:17:003:0	“ Lay down , now , a pledge for me with Yourself ; Who is there that will be my guarantor ?
18:17:004:0	For You have kept their heart from understanding , Therefore You will not exalt them .
18:17:005:0	He who informs against friends for a share of the spoil , The eyes of his children also will languish .
18:17:006:0	“ But He has made me a byword of the people , And I am one at whom men spit .
18:17:007:0	My eye has also grown dim because of grief , And all my members are as a shadow .
18:17:008:0	The upright will be appalled at this , And the innocent will stir up himself against the godless .
18:17:009:0	Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his way , And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger .
18:17:010:0	But come again all of you now , For I do not find a wise man among you .
18:17:011:0	My days are past , my plans are torn apart , Even the wishes of my heart .
18:17:012:0	They make night into day , saying , ‘The light is near , ’ in the presence of darkness .
18:17:013:0	If I look for Sheol as my home , I make my bed in the darkness ;
18:17:014:0	If I call to the pit , ‘You are my father’ ; To the worm , ‘my mother and my sister’ ;
18:17:015:0	Where now is my hope ? And who regards my hope ?
18:17:016:0	Will it go down with me to Sheol ? Shall we together go down into the dust ? ”
