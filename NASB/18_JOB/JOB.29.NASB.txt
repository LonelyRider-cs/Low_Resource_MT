18:29:001:1	Job’s Past Was Glorious
18:29:001:0	And Job again took up his discourse and said ,
18:29:002:0	“ Oh that I were as in months gone by , As in the days when God watched over me ;
18:29:003:0	When His lamp shone over my head , And by His light I walked through darkness ;
18:29:004:0	As I was in the prime of my days , When the friendship of God was over my tent ;
18:29:005:0	When the Almighty was yet with me , And my children were around me ;
18:29:006:0	When my steps were bathed in butter , And the rock poured out for me streams of oil !
18:29:007:0	When I went out to the gate of the city , When I took my seat in the square ,
18:29:008:0	The young men saw me and hid themselves , And the old men arose and stood .
18:29:009:0	The princes stopped talkingAnd put their hands on their mouths ;
18:29:010:0	The voice of the nobles was hushed , And their tongue stuck to their palate .
18:29:011:0	For when the ear heard , it called me blessed , And when the eye saw , it gave witness of me ,
18:29:012:0	Because I delivered the poor who cried for help , And the orphan who had no helper .
18:29:013:0	The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me , And I made the widow’s heart sing for joy .
18:29:014:0	I put on righteousness , and it clothed me ; My justice was like a robe and a turban .
18:29:015:0	I was eyes to the blindAnd feet to the lame .
18:29:016:0	I was a father to the needy , And I investigated the case which I did not know .
18:29:017:0	I broke the jaws of the wickedAnd snatched the prey from his teeth .
18:29:018:0	Then I thought , ‘I shall die in my nest , And I shall multiply my days as the sand .
18:29:019:0	My root is spread out to the waters , And dew lies all night on my branch .
18:29:020:0	My glory is ever new with me , And my bow is renewed in my hand . ’
18:29:021:0	“ To me they listened and waited , And kept silent for my counsel .
18:29:022:0	After my words they did not speak again , And my speech dropped on them .
18:29:023:0	They waited for me as for the rain , And opened their mouth as for the spring rain .
18:29:024:0	I smiled on them when they did not believe , And the light of my face they did not cast down .
18:29:025:0	I chose a way for them and sat as chief , And dwelt as a king among the troops , As one who comforted the mourners .
