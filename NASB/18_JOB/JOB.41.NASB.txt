18:41:001:1	God’s Power Shown in Creatures
18:41:001:0	“ Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook ? Or press down his tongue with a cord ?
18:41:002:0	Can you put a rope in his noseOr pierce his jaw with a hook ?
18:41:003:0	Will he make many supplications to you , Or will he speak to you soft words ?
18:41:004:0	Will he make a covenant with you ? Will you take him for a servant forever ?
18:41:005:0	Will you play with him as with a bird , Or will you bind him for your maidens ?
18:41:006:0	Will the traders bargain over him ? Will they divide him among the merchants ?
18:41:007:0	Can you fill his skin with harpoons , Or his head with fishing spears ?
18:41:008:0	Lay your hand on him ; Remember the battle ; you will not do it again !
18:41:009:0	Behold , your expectation is false ; Will you be laid low even at the sight of him ?
18:41:010:0	No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him ; Who then is he that can stand before Me ?
18:41:011:0	Who has given to Me that I should repay him ? Whatever is under the whole heaven is Mine .
18:41:012:0	“ I will not keep silence concerning his limbs , Or his mighty strength , or his orderly frame .
18:41:013:0	Who can strip off his outer armor ? Who can come within his double mail ?
18:41:014:0	Who can open the doors of his face ? Around his teeth there is terror .
18:41:015:0	His strong scales are his pride , Shut up as with a tight seal .
18:41:016:0	One is so near to anotherThat no air can come between them .
18:41:017:0	They are joined one to another ; They clasp each other and cannot be separated .
18:41:018:0	His sneezes flash forth light , And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
18:41:019:0	Out of his mouth go burning torches ; Sparks of fire leap forth .
18:41:020:0	Out of his nostrils smoke goes forthAs from a boiling pot and burning rushes .
18:41:021:0	His breath kindles coals , And a flame goes forth from his mouth .
18:41:022:0	In his neck lodges strength , And dismay leaps before him .
18:41:023:0	The folds of his flesh are joined together , Firm on him and immovable .
18:41:024:0	His heart is as hard as a stone , Even as hard as a lower millstone .
18:41:025:0	When he raises himself up , the mighty fear ; Because of the crashing they are bewildered .
18:41:026:0	The sword that reaches him cannot avail , Nor the spear , the dart or the javelin .
18:41:027:0	He regards iron as straw , Bronze as rotten wood .
18:41:028:0	The arrow cannot make him flee ; Slingstones are turned into stubble for him .
18:41:029:0	Clubs are regarded as stubble ; He laughs at the rattling of the javelin .
18:41:030:0	His underparts are like sharp potsherds ; He spreads out like a threshing sledge on the mire .
18:41:031:0	He makes the depths boil like a pot ; He makes the sea like a jar of ointment .
18:41:032:0	Behind him he makes a wake to shine ; One would think the deep to be gray-haired .
18:41:033:0	Nothing on earth is like him , One made without fear .
18:41:034:0	He looks on everything that is high ; He is king over all the sons of pride . ”
