18:37:001:1	Elihu Says God Is Back of the Storm
18:37:001:0	“ At this also my heart trembles , And leaps from its place .
18:37:002:0	Listen closely to the thunder of His voice , And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth .
18:37:003:0	Under the whole heaven He lets it loose , And His lightning to the ends of the earth .
18:37:004:0	After it , a voice roars ; He thunders with His majestic voice , And He does not restrain the lightnings when His voice is heard .
18:37:005:0	God thunders with His voice wondrously , Doing great things which we cannot comprehend .
18:37:006:0	For to the snow He says , ‘Fall on the earth , ’And to the downpour and the rain , ‘Be strong . ’
18:37:007:0	He seals the hand of every man , That all men may know His work .
18:37:008:0	Then the beast goes into its lairAnd remains in its den .
18:37:009:0	Out of the south comes the storm , And out of the north the cold .
18:37:010:0	From the breath of God ice is made , And the expanse of the waters is frozen .
18:37:011:0	Also with moisture He loads the thick cloud ; He disperses the cloud of His lightning .
18:37:012:0	It changes direction , turning around by His guidance , That it may do whatever He commands itOn the face of the inhabited earth .
18:37:013:0	Whether for correction , or for His world , Or for lovingkindness , He causes it to happen .
18:37:014:0	“ Listen to this , O Job , Stand and consider the wonders of God .
18:37:015:0	Do you know how God establishes them , And makes the lightning of His cloud to shine ?
18:37:016:0	Do you know about the layers of the thick clouds , The wonders of one perfect in knowledge ,
18:37:017:0	You whose garments are hot , When the land is still because of the south wind ?
18:37:018:0	Can you , with Him , spread out the skies , Strong as a molten mirror ?
18:37:019:0	Teach us what we shall say to Him ; We cannot arrange our case because of darkness .
18:37:020:0	Shall it be told Him that I would speak ? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up ?
18:37:021:0	“ Now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies ; But the wind has passed and cleared them .
18:37:022:0	Out of the north comes golden splendor ; Around God is awesome majesty .
18:37:023:0	The Almighty—we cannot find Him ; He is exalted in powerAnd He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness .
18:37:024:0	Therefore men fear Him ; He does not regard any who are wise of heart . ”
