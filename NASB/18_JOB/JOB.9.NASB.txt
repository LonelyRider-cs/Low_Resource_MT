18:9:001:1	Job Says There Is No Arbitrator between God and Man
18:9:001:0	Then Job answered ,
18:9:002:0	“ In truth I know that this is so ; But how can a man be in the right before God ?
18:9:003:0	If one wished to dispute with Him , He could not answer Him once in a thousand times .
18:9:004:0	Wise in heart and mighty in strength , Who has defied Him without harm ?
18:9:005:0	It is God who removes the mountains , they know not how , When He overturns them in His anger ;
18:9:006:0	Who shakes the earth out of its place , And its pillars tremble ;
18:9:007:0	Who commands the sun not to shine , And sets a seal upon the stars ;
18:9:008:0	Who alone stretches out the heavensAnd tramples down the waves of the sea ;
18:9:009:0	Who makes the Bear , Orion and the Pleiades , And the chambers of the south ;
18:9:010:0	Who does great things , unfathomable , And wondrous works without number .
18:9:011:0	Were He to pass by me , I would not see Him ; Were He to move past me , I would not perceive Him .
18:9:012:0	Were He to snatch away , who could restrain Him ? Who could say to Him , ‘What are You doing ? ’
18:9:013:0	“ God will not turn back His anger ; Beneath Him crouch the helpers of Rahab .
18:9:014:0	How then can I answer Him , And choose my words before Him ?
18:9:015:0	For though I were right , I could not answer ; I would have to implore the mercy of my judge .
18:9:016:0	If I called and He answered me , I could not believe that He was listening to my voice .
18:9:017:0	For He bruises me with a tempestAnd multiplies my wounds without cause .
18:9:018:0	He will not allow me to get my breath , But saturates me with bitterness .
18:9:019:0	If it is a matter of power , behold , He is the strong one ! And if it is a matter of justice , who can summon Him ?
18:9:020:0	Though I am righteous , my mouth will condemn me ; Though I am guiltless , He will declare me guilty .
18:9:021:0	I am guiltless ; I do not take notice of myself ; I despise my life .
18:9:022:0	It is all one ; therefore I say , ‘He destroys the guiltless and the wicked . ’
18:9:023:0	If the scourge kills suddenly , He mocks the despair of the innocent .
18:9:024:0	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked ; He covers the faces of its judges . If it is not He , then who is it ?
18:9:025:0	“ Now my days are swifter than a runner ; They flee away , they see no good .
18:9:026:0	They slip by like reed boats , Like an eagle that swoops on its prey .
18:9:027:0	Though I say , ‘I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my sad countenance and be cheerful , ’
18:9:028:0	I am afraid of all my pains , I know that You will not acquit me .
18:9:029:0	I am accounted wicked , Why then should I toil in vain ?
18:9:030:0	If I should wash myself with snowAnd cleanse my hands with lye ,
18:9:031:0	Yet You would plunge me into the pit , And my own clothes would abhor me .
18:9:032:0	For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him , That we may go to court together .
18:9:033:0	There is no umpire between us , Who may lay his hand upon us both .
18:9:034:0	Let Him remove His rod from me , And let not dread of Him terrify me .
18:9:035:0	Then I would speak and not fear Him ; But I am not like that in myself .
