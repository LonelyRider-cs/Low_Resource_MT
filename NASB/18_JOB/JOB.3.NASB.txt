18:3:001:1	Job’s Lament
18:3:001:0	Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth .
18:3:002:0	And Job said ,
18:3:003:0	“ Let the day perish on which I was to be born , And the night which said , ‘A boy is conceived . ’
18:3:004:0	May that day be darkness ; Let not God above care for it , Nor light shine on it .
18:3:005:0	Let darkness and black gloom claim it ; Let a cloud settle on it ; Let the blackness of the day terrify it .
18:3:006:0	As for that night , let darkness seize it ; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year ; Let it not come into the number of the months .
18:3:007:0	Behold , let that night be barren ; Let no joyful shout enter it .
18:3:008:0	Let those curse it who curse the day , Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan .
18:3:009:0	Let the stars of its twilight be darkened ; Let it wait for light but have none , And let it not see the breaking dawn ;
18:3:010:0	Because it did not shut the opening of my mother’s womb , Or hide trouble from my eyes .
18:3:011:0	“ Why did I not die at birth , Come forth from the womb and expire ?
18:3:012:0	Why did the knees receive me , And why the breasts , that I should suck ?
18:3:013:0	For now I would have lain down and been quiet ; I would have slept then , I would have been at rest ,
18:3:014:0	With kings and with counselors of the earth , Who rebuilt ruins for themselves ;
18:3:015:0	Or with princes who had gold , Who were filling their houses with silver .
18:3:016:0	Or like a miscarriage which is discarded , I would not be , As infants that never saw light .
18:3:017:0	There the wicked cease from raging , And there the weary are at rest .
18:3:018:0	The prisoners are at ease together ; They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster .
18:3:019:0	The small and the great are there , And the slave is free from his master .
18:3:020:0	“ Why is light given to him who suffers , And life to the bitter of soul ,
18:3:021:0	Who long for death , but there is none , And dig for it more than for hidden treasures ,
18:3:022:0	Who rejoice greatly , And exult when they find the grave ?
18:3:023:0	Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden , And whom God has hedged in ?
18:3:024:0	For my groaning comes at the sight of my food , And my cries pour out like water .
18:3:025:0	For what I fear comes upon me , And what I dread befalls me .
18:3:026:0	I am not at ease , nor am I quiet , And I am not at rest , but turmoil comes . ”
