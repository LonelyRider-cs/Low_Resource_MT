18:2:001:1	Job Loses His Health
18:2:001:0	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord .
18:2:002:0	The Lord said to Satan , “ Where have you come from ? ” Then Satan answered the Lord and said , “ From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it . ”
18:2:003:0	The Lord said to Satan , “ Have you considered My servant Job ? For there is no one like him on the earth , a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil . And he still holds fast his integrity , although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause . ”
18:2:004:0	Satan answered the Lord and said , “ Skin for skin ! Yes , all that a man has he will give for his life .
18:2:005:0	However , put forth Your hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh ; he will curse You to Your face . ”
18:2:006:0	So the Lord said to Satan , “ Behold , he is in your power , only spare his life . ”
18:2:007:0	Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head .
18:2:008:0	And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes .
18:2:009:0	Then his wife said to him , “ Do you still hold fast your integrity ? Curse God and die ! ”
18:2:010:0	But he said to her , “ You speak as one of the foolish women speaks . Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity ? ” In all this Job did not sin with his lips .
18:2:011:0	Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him , they came each one from his own place , Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite ; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him .
18:2:012:0	When they lifted up their eyes at a distance and did not recognize him , they raised their voices and wept . And each of them tore his robe and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky .
18:2:013:0	Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him , for they saw that his pain was very great .
