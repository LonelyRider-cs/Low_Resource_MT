18:30:001:1	Job’s Present State Is Humiliating
18:30:001:0	“ But now those younger than I mock me , Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock .
18:30:002:0	Indeed , what good was the strength of their hands to me ? Vigor had perished from them .
18:30:003:0	From want and famine they are gauntWho gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation ,
18:30:004:0	Who pluck mallow by the bushes , And whose food is the root of the broom shrub .
18:30:005:0	They are driven from the community ; They shout against them as against a thief ,
18:30:006:0	So that they dwell in dreadful valleys , In holes of the earth and of the rocks .
18:30:007:0	Among the bushes they cry out ; Under the nettles they are gathered together .
18:30:008:0	Fools , even those without a name , They were scourged from the land .
18:30:009:0	“ And now I have become their taunt , I have even become a byword to them .
18:30:010:0	They abhor me and stand aloof from me , And they do not refrain from spitting at my face .
18:30:011:0	Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me , They have cast off the bridle before me .
18:30:012:0	On the right hand their brood arises ; They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction .
18:30:013:0	They break up my path , They profit from my destruction ; No one restrains them .
18:30:014:0	As through a wide breach they come , Amid the tempest they roll on .
18:30:015:0	Terrors are turned against me ; They pursue my honor as the wind , And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud .
18:30:016:0	“ And now my soul is poured out within me ; Days of affliction have seized me .
18:30:017:0	At night it pierces my bones within me , And my gnawing pains take no rest .
18:30:018:0	By a great force my garment is distorted ; It binds me about as the collar of my coat .
18:30:019:0	He has cast me into the mire , And I have become like dust and ashes .
18:30:020:0	I cry out to You for help , but You do not answer me ; I stand up , and You turn Your attention against me .
18:30:021:0	You have become cruel to me ; With the might of Your hand You persecute me .
18:30:022:0	You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride ; And You dissolve me in a storm .
18:30:023:0	For I know that You will bring me to deathAnd to the house of meeting for all living .
18:30:024:0	“ Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand , Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help ?
18:30:025:0	Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard ? Was not my soul grieved for the needy ?
18:30:026:0	When I expected good , then evil came ; When I waited for light , then darkness came .
18:30:027:0	I am seething within and cannot relax ; Days of affliction confront me .
18:30:028:0	I go about mourning without comfort ; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help .
18:30:029:0	I have become a brother to jackalsAnd a companion of ostriches .
18:30:030:0	My skin turns black on me , And my bones burn with fever .
18:30:031:0	Therefore my harp is turned to mourning , And my flute to the sound of those who weep .
