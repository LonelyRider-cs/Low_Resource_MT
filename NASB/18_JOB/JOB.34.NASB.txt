18:34:001:1	Elihu Vindicates God’s Justice
18:34:001:0	Then Elihu continued and said ,
18:34:002:0	“ Hear my words , you wise men , And listen to me , you who know .
18:34:003:0	For the ear tests wordsAs the palate tastes food .
18:34:004:0	Let us choose for ourselves what is right ; Let us know among ourselves what is good .
18:34:005:0	For Job has said , ‘I am righteous , But God has taken away my right ;
18:34:006:0	Should I lie concerning my right ? My wound is incurable , though I am without transgression . ’
18:34:007:0	What man is like Job , Who drinks up derision like water ,
18:34:008:0	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity , And walks with wicked men ?
18:34:009:0	For he has said , ‘It profits a man nothingWhen he is pleased with God . ’
18:34:010:0	“ Therefore , listen to me , you men of understanding . Far be it from God to do wickedness , And from the Almighty to do wrong .
18:34:011:0	For He pays a man according to his work , And makes him find it according to his way .
18:34:012:0	Surely , God will not act wickedly , And the Almighty will not pervert justice .
18:34:013:0	Who gave Him authority over the earth ? And who has laid on Him the whole world ?
18:34:014:0	If He should determine to do so , If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath ,
18:34:015:0	All flesh would perish together , And man would return to dust .
18:34:016:0	“ But if you have understanding , hear this ; Listen to the sound of my words .
18:34:017:0	Shall one who hates justice rule ? And will you condemn the righteous mighty One ,
18:34:018:0	Who says to a king , ‘Worthless one , ’To nobles , ‘Wicked ones’ ;
18:34:019:0	Who shows no partiality to princesNor regards the rich above the poor , For they all are the work of His hands ?
18:34:020:0	In a moment they die , and at midnightPeople are shaken and pass away , And the mighty are taken away without a hand .
18:34:021:0	“ For His eyes are upon the ways of a man , And He sees all his steps .
18:34:022:0	There is no darkness or deep shadowWhere the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
18:34:023:0	For He does not need to consider a man further , That he should go before God in judgment .
18:34:024:0	He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry , And sets others in their place .
18:34:025:0	Therefore He knows their works , And He overthrows them in the night , And they are crushed .
18:34:026:0	He strikes them like the wickedIn a public place ,
18:34:027:0	Because they turned aside from following Him , And had no regard for any of His ways ;
18:34:028:0	So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him , And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted—
18:34:029:0	When He keeps quiet , who then can condemn ? And when He hides His face , who then can behold Him , That is , in regard to both nation and man ? —
18:34:030:0	So that godless men would not ruleNor be snares of the people .
18:34:031:0	“ For has anyone said to God , ‘I have borne chastisement ; I will not offend anymore ;
18:34:032:0	Teach me what I do not see ; If I have done iniquity , I will not do it again’ ?
18:34:033:0	Shall He recompense on your terms , because you have rejected it ? For you must choose , and not I ; Therefore declare what you know .
18:34:034:0	Men of understanding will say to me , And a wise man who hears me ,
18:34:035:0	‘Job speaks without knowledge , And his words are without wisdom .
18:34:036:0	Job ought to be tried to the limit , Because he answers like wicked men .
18:34:037:0	For he adds rebellion to his sin ; He claps his hands among us , And multiplies his words against God . ’ ”
