18:36:001:1	Elihu Speaks of God’s Dealings with Men
18:36:001:0	Then Elihu continued and said ,
18:36:002:0	“ Wait for me a little , and I will show youThat there is yet more to be said in God’s behalf .
18:36:003:0	I will fetch my knowledge from afar , And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker .
18:36:004:0	For truly my words are not false ; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you .
18:36:005:0	Behold , God is mighty but does not despise any ; He is mighty in strength of understanding .
18:36:006:0	He does not keep the wicked alive , But gives justice to the afflicted .
18:36:007:0	He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous ; But with kings on the throneHe has seated them forever , and they are exalted .
18:36:008:0	And if they are bound in fetters , And are caught in the cords of affliction ,
18:36:009:0	Then He declares to them their workAnd their transgressions , that they have magnified themselves .
18:36:010:0	He opens their ear to instruction , And commands that they return from evil .
18:36:011:0	If they hear and serve Him , They will end their days in prosperityAnd their years in pleasures .
18:36:012:0	But if they do not hear , they shall perish by the swordAnd they will die without knowledge .
18:36:013:0	But the godless in heart lay up anger ; They do not cry for help when He binds them .
18:36:014:0	They die in youth , And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes .
18:36:015:0	He delivers the afflicted in their affliction , And opens their ear in time of oppression .
18:36:016:0	Then indeed , He enticed you from the mouth of distress , Instead of it , a broad place with no constraint ; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness .
18:36:017:0	“ But you were full of judgment on the wicked ; Judgment and justice take hold of you .
18:36:018:0	Beware that wrath does not entice you to scoffing ; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside .
18:36:019:0	Will your riches keep you from distress , Or all the forces of your strength ?
18:36:020:0	Do not long for the night , When people vanish in their place .
18:36:021:0	Be careful , do not turn to evil , For you have preferred this to affliction .
18:36:022:0	Behold , God is exalted in His power ; Who is a teacher like Him ?
18:36:023:0	Who has appointed Him His way , And who has said , ‘You have done wrong’ ?
18:36:024:0	“ Remember that you should exalt His work , Of which men have sung .
18:36:025:0	All men have seen it ; Man beholds from afar .
18:36:026:0	Behold , God is exalted , and we do not know Him ; The number of His years is unsearchable .
18:36:027:0	For He draws up the drops of water , They distill rain from the mist ,
18:36:028:0	Which the clouds pour down , They drip upon man abundantly .
18:36:029:0	Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds , The thundering of His pavilion ?
18:36:030:0	Behold , He spreads His lightning about Him , And He covers the depths of the sea .
18:36:031:0	For by these He judges peoples ; He gives food in abundance .
18:36:032:0	He covers His hands with the lightning , And commands it to strike the mark .
18:36:033:0	Its noise declares His presence ; The cattle also , concerning what is coming up .
