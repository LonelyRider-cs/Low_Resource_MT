18:10:001:1	Job Despairs of God’s Dealings
18:10:001:0	“ I loathe my own life ; I will give full vent to my complaint ; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
18:10:002:0	I will say to God , ‘Do not condemn me ; Let me know why You contend with me .
18:10:003:0	Is it right for You indeed to oppress , To reject the labor of Your hands , And to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked ?
18:10:004:0	Have You eyes of flesh ? Or do You see as a man sees ?
18:10:005:0	Are Your days as the days of a mortal , Or Your years as man’s years ,
18:10:006:0	That You should seek for my guiltAnd search after my sin ?
18:10:007:0	According to Your knowledge I am indeed not guilty , Yet there is no deliverance from Your hand .
18:10:008:0	‘Your hands fashioned and made me altogether , And would You destroy me ?
18:10:009:0	Remember now , that You have made me as clay ; And would You turn me into dust again ?
18:10:010:0	Did You not pour me out like milkAnd curdle me like cheese ;
18:10:011:0	Clothe me with skin and flesh , And knit me together with bones and sinews ?
18:10:012:0	You have granted me life and lovingkindness ; And Your care has preserved my spirit .
18:10:013:0	Yet these things You have concealed in Your heart ; I know that this is within You :
18:10:014:0	If I sin , then You would take note of me , And would not acquit me of my guilt .
18:10:015:0	If I am wicked , woe to me ! And if I am righteous , I dare not lift up my head . I am sated with disgrace and conscious of my misery .
18:10:016:0	Should my head be lifted up , You would hunt me like a lion ; And again You would show Your power against me .
18:10:017:0	You renew Your witnesses against meAnd increase Your anger toward me ; Hardship after hardship is with me .
18:10:018:0	‘Why then have You brought me out of the womb ? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me !
18:10:019:0	I should have been as though I had not been , Carried from womb to tomb . ’
18:10:020:0	Would He not let my few days alone ? Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer
18:10:021:0	Before I go—and I shall not return—To the land of darkness and deep shadow ,
18:10:022:0	The land of utter gloom as darkness itself , Of deep shadow without order , And which shines as the darkness . ”
