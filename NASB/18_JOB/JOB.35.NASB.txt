18:35:001:1	Elihu Sharply Reproves Job
18:35:001:0	Then Elihu continued and said ,
18:35:002:0	“ Do you think this is according to justice ? Do you say , ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’ ?
18:35:003:0	For you say , ‘What advantage will it be to You ? What profit will I have , more than if I had sinned ? ’
18:35:004:0	I will answer you , And your friends with you .
18:35:005:0	Look at the heavens and see ; And behold the clouds—they are higher than you .
18:35:006:0	If you have sinned , what do you accomplish against Him ? And if your transgressions are many , what do you do to Him ?
18:35:007:0	If you are righteous , what do you give to Him , Or what does He receive from your hand ?
18:35:008:0	Your wickedness is for a man like yourself , And your righteousness is for a son of man .
18:35:009:0	“ Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out ; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty .
18:35:010:0	But no one says , ‘Where is God my Maker , Who gives songs in the night ,
18:35:011:0	Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earthAnd makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens ? ’
18:35:012:0	There they cry out , but He does not answerBecause of the pride of evil men .
18:35:013:0	Surely God will not listen to an empty cry , Nor will the Almighty regard it .
18:35:014:0	How much less when you say you do not behold Him , The case is before Him , and you must wait for Him !
18:35:015:0	And now , because He has not visited in His anger , Nor has He acknowledged transgression well ,
18:35:016:0	So Job opens his mouth emptily ; He multiplies words without knowledge . ”
