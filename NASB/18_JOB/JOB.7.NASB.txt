18:7:001:1	Job’s Life Seems Futile
18:7:001:0	“ Is not man forced to labor on earth , And are not his days like the days of a hired man ?
18:7:002:0	As a slave who pants for the shade , And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages ,
18:7:003:0	So am I allotted months of vanity , And nights of trouble are appointed me .
18:7:004:0	When I lie down I say , ‘When shall I arise ? ’But the night continues , And I am continually tossing until dawn .
18:7:005:0	My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt , My skin hardens and runs .
18:7:006:0	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle , And come to an end without hope .
18:7:007:0	“ Remember that my life is but breath ; My eye will not again see good .
18:7:008:0	The eye of him who sees me will behold me no longer ; Your eyes will be on me , but I will not be .
18:7:009:0	When a cloud vanishes , it is gone , So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up .
18:7:010:0	He will not return again to his house , Nor will his place know him anymore .
18:7:011:0	“ Therefore I will not restrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit , I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
18:7:012:0	Am I the sea , or the sea monster , That You set a guard over me ?
18:7:013:0	If I say , ‘My bed will comfort me , My couch will ease my complaint , ’
18:7:014:0	Then You frighten me with dreamsAnd terrify me by visions ;
18:7:015:0	So that my soul would choose suffocation , Death rather than my pains .
18:7:016:0	I waste away ; I will not live forever . Leave me alone , for my days are but a breath .
18:7:017:0	What is man that You magnify him , And that You are concerned about him ,
18:7:018:0	That You examine him every morningAnd try him every moment ?
18:7:019:0	Will You never turn Your gaze away from me , Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle ?
18:7:020:0	Have I sinned ? What have I done to You , O watcher of men ? Why have You set me as Your target , So that I am a burden to myself ?
18:7:021:0	Why then do You not pardon my transgressionAnd take away my iniquity ? For now I will lie down in the dust ; And You will seek me , but I will not be . ”
