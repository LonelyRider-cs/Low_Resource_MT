18:38:001:1	God Speaks Now to Job
18:38:001:0	Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said ,
18:38:002:0	“ Who is this that darkens counselBy words without knowledge ?
18:38:003:0	Now gird up your loins like a man , And I will ask you , and you instruct Me !
18:38:004:0	Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth ? Tell Me , if you have understanding ,
18:38:005:0	Who set its measurements ? Since you know . Or who stretched the line on it ?
18:38:006:0	On what were its bases sunk ? Or who laid its cornerstone ,
18:38:007:0	When the morning stars sang togetherAnd all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
18:38:008:0	“ Or who enclosed the sea with doorsWhen , bursting forth , it went out from the womb ;
18:38:009:0	When I made a cloud its garmentAnd thick darkness its swaddling band ,
18:38:010:0	And I placed boundaries on itAnd set a bolt and doors ,
18:38:002:1	God’s Mighty Power
18:38:011:0	And I said , ‘Thus far you shall come , but no farther ; And here shall your proud waves stop’ ?
18:38:012:0	“ Have you ever in your life commanded the morning , And caused the dawn to know its place ,
18:38:013:0	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth , And the wicked be shaken out of it ?
18:38:014:0	It is changed like clay under the seal ; And they stand forth like a garment .
18:38:015:0	From the wicked their light is withheld , And the uplifted arm is broken .
18:38:016:0	“ Have you entered into the springs of the seaOr walked in the recesses of the deep ?
18:38:017:0	Have the gates of death been revealed to you , Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness ?
18:38:018:0	Have you understood the expanse of the earth ? Tell Me , if you know all this .
18:38:019:0	“ Where is the way to the dwelling of light ? And darkness , where is its place ,
18:38:020:0	That you may take it to its territoryAnd that you may discern the paths to its home ?
18:38:021:0	You know , for you were born then , And the number of your days is great !
18:38:022:0	Have you entered the storehouses of the snow , Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail ,
18:38:023:0	Which I have reserved for the time of distress , For the day of war and battle ?
18:38:024:0	Where is the way that the light is divided , Or the east wind scattered on the earth ?
18:38:025:0	“ Who has cleft a channel for the flood , Or a way for the thunderbolt ,
18:38:026:0	To bring rain on a land without people , On a desert without a man in it ,
18:38:027:0	To satisfy the waste and desolate landAnd to make the seeds of grass to sprout ?
18:38:028:0	Has the rain a father ? Or who has begotten the drops of dew ?
18:38:029:0	From whose womb has come the ice ? And the frost of heaven , who has given it birth ?
18:38:030:0	Water becomes hard like stone , And the surface of the deep is imprisoned .
18:38:031:0	“ Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades , Or loose the cords of Orion ?
18:38:032:0	Can you lead forth a constellation in its season , And guide the Bear with her satellites ?
18:38:033:0	Do you know the ordinances of the heavens , Or fix their rule over the earth ?
18:38:034:0	“ Can you lift up your voice to the clouds , So that an abundance of water will cover you ?
18:38:035:0	Can you send forth lightnings that they may goAnd say to you , ‘Here we are’ ?
18:38:036:0	Who has put wisdom in the innermost beingOr given understanding to the mind ?
18:38:037:0	Who can count the clouds by wisdom , Or tip the water jars of the heavens ,
18:38:038:0	When the dust hardens into a massAnd the clods stick together ?
18:38:039:0	“ Can you hunt the prey for the lion , Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions ,
18:38:040:0	When they crouch in their dens And lie in wait in their lair ?
18:38:041:0	Who prepares for the raven its nourishmentWhen its young cry to GodAnd wander about without food ?
