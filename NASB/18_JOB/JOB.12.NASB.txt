18:12:001:1	Job Chides His Accusers
18:12:001:0	Then Job responded ,
18:12:002:0	“ Truly then you are the people , And with you wisdom will die !
18:12:003:0	But I have intelligence as well as you ; I am not inferior to you . And who does not know such things as these ?
18:12:004:0	I am a joke to my friends , The one who called on God and He answered him ; The just and blameless man is a joke .
18:12:005:0	He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt , As prepared for those whose feet slip .
18:12:006:0	The tents of the destroyers prosper , And those who provoke God are secure , Whom God brings into their power .
18:12:007:0	“ But now ask the beasts , and let them teach you ; And the birds of the heavens , and let them tell you .
18:12:008:0	Or speak to the earth , and let it teach you ; And let the fish of the sea declare to you .
18:12:009:0	Who among all these does not knowThat the hand of the Lord has done this ,
18:12:010:0	In whose hand is the life of every living thing , And the breath of all mankind ?
18:12:011:0	Does not the ear test words , As the palate tastes its food ?
18:12:002:1	Job Speaks of the Power of God
18:12:012:0	Wisdom is with aged men , With long life is understanding .
18:12:013:0	“ With Him are wisdom and might ; To Him belong counsel and understanding .
18:12:014:0	Behold , He tears down , and it cannot be rebuilt ; He imprisons a man , and there can be no release .
18:12:015:0	Behold , He restrains the waters , and they dry up ; And He sends them out , and they inundate the earth .
18:12:016:0	With Him are strength and sound wisdom , The misled and the misleader belong to Him .
18:12:017:0	He makes counselors walk barefootAnd makes fools of judges .
18:12:018:0	He loosens the bond of kingsAnd binds their loins with a girdle .
18:12:019:0	He makes priests walk barefootAnd overthrows the secure ones .
18:12:020:0	He deprives the trusted ones of speechAnd takes away the discernment of the elders .
18:12:021:0	He pours contempt on noblesAnd loosens the belt of the strong .
18:12:022:0	He reveals mysteries from the darknessAnd brings the deep darkness into light .
18:12:023:0	He makes the nations great , then destroys them ; He enlarges the nations , then leads them away .
18:12:024:0	He deprives of intelligence the chiefs of the earth’s peopleAnd makes them wander in a pathless waste .
18:12:025:0	They grope in darkness with no light , And He makes them stagger like a drunken man .
