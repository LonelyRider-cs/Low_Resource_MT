18:15:001:1	Eliphaz Says Job Presumes Much
18:15:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded ,
18:15:002:0	“ Should a wise man answer with windy knowledgeAnd fill himself with the east wind ?
18:15:003:0	Should he argue with useless talk , Or with words which are not profitable ?
18:15:004:0	Indeed , you do away with reverenceAnd hinder meditation before God .
18:15:005:0	For your guilt teaches your mouth , And you choose the language of the crafty .
18:15:006:0	Your own mouth condemns you , and not I ; And your own lips testify against you .
18:15:007:0	“ Were you the first man to be born , Or were you brought forth before the hills ?
18:15:008:0	Do you hear the secret counsel of God , And limit wisdom to yourself ?
18:15:009:0	What do you know that we do not know ? What do you understand that we do not ?
18:15:010:0	Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us , Older than your father .
18:15:011:0	Are the consolations of God too small for you , Even the word spoken gently with you ?
18:15:012:0	Why does your heart carry you away ? And why do your eyes flash ,
18:15:013:0	That you should turn your spirit against GodAnd allow such words to go out of your mouth ?
18:15:014:0	What is man , that he should be pure , Or he who is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
18:15:015:0	Behold , He puts no trust in His holy ones , And the heavens are not pure in His sight ;
18:15:002:1	What Eliphaz Has Seen of Life
18:15:016:0	How much less one who is detestable and corrupt , Man , who drinks iniquity like water !
18:15:017:0	“ I will tell you , listen to me ; And what I have seen I will also declare ;
18:15:018:0	What wise men have told , And have not concealed from their fathers ,
18:15:019:0	To whom alone the land was given , And no alien passed among them .
18:15:020:0	The wicked man writhes in pain all his days , And numbered are the years stored up for the ruthless .
18:15:021:0	Sounds of terror are in his ears ; While at peace the destroyer comes upon him .
18:15:022:0	He does not believe that he will return from darkness , And he is destined for the sword .
18:15:023:0	He wanders about for food , saying , ‘Where is it ? ’He knows that a day of darkness is at hand .
18:15:024:0	Distress and anguish terrify him , They overpower him like a king ready for the attack ,
18:15:025:0	Because he has stretched out his hand against GodAnd conducts himself arrogantly against the Almighty .
18:15:026:0	He rushes headlong at HimWith his massive shield .
18:15:027:0	For he has covered his face with his fatAnd made his thighs heavy with flesh .
18:15:028:0	He has lived in desolate cities , In houses no one would inhabit , Which are destined to become ruins .
18:15:029:0	He will not become rich , nor will his wealth endure ; And his grain will not bend down to the ground .
18:15:030:0	He will not escape from darkness ; The flame will wither his shoots , And by the breath of His mouth he will go away .
18:15:031:0	Let him not trust in emptiness , deceiving himself ; For emptiness will be his reward .
18:15:032:0	It will be accomplished before his time , And his palm branch will not be green .
18:15:033:0	He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine , And will cast off his flower like the olive tree .
18:15:034:0	For the company of the godless is barren , And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt .
18:15:035:0	They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity , And their mind prepares deception . ”
