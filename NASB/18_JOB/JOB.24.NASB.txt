18:24:001:1	Job Says God Seems to Ignore Wrongs
18:24:001:0	“ Why are times not stored up by the Almighty , And why do those who know Him not see His days ?
18:24:002:0	Some remove the landmarks ; They seize and devour flocks .
18:24:003:0	They drive away the donkeys of the orphans ; They take the widow’s ox for a pledge .
18:24:004:0	They push the needy aside from the road ; The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether .
18:24:005:0	Behold , as wild donkeys in the wildernessThey go forth seeking food in their activity , As bread for their children in the desert .
18:24:006:0	They harvest their fodder in the fieldAnd glean the vineyard of the wicked .
18:24:007:0	They spend the night naked , without clothing , And have no covering against the cold .
18:24:008:0	They are wet with the mountain rainsAnd hug the rock for want of a shelter .
18:24:009:0	Others snatch the orphan from the breast , And against the poor they take a pledge .
18:24:010:0	They cause the poor to go about naked without clothing , And they take away the sheaves from the hungry .
18:24:011:0	Within the walls they produce oil ; They tread wine presses but thirst .
18:24:012:0	From the city men groan , And the souls of the wounded cry out ; Yet God does not pay attention to folly .
18:24:013:0	“ Others have been with those who rebel against the light ; They do not want to know its waysNor abide in its paths .
18:24:014:0	The murderer arises at dawn ; He kills the poor and the needy , And at night he is as a thief .
18:24:015:0	The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight , Saying , ‘No eye will see me . ’And he disguises his face .
18:24:016:0	In the dark they dig into houses , They shut themselves up by day ; They do not know the light .
18:24:017:0	For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness , For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness .
18:24:018:0	“ They are insignificant on the surface of the water ; Their portion is cursed on the earth . They do not turn toward the vineyards .
18:24:019:0	Drought and heat consume the snow waters , So does Sheol those who have sinned .
18:24:020:0	A mother will forget him ; The worm feeds sweetly till he is no longer remembered . And wickedness will be broken like a tree .
18:24:021:0	He wrongs the barren womanAnd does no good for the widow .
18:24:022:0	But He drags off the valiant by His power ; He rises , but no one has assurance of life .
18:24:023:0	He provides them with security , and they are supported ; And His eyes are on their ways .
18:24:024:0	They are exalted a little while , then they are gone ; Moreover , they are brought low and like everything gathered up ; Even like the heads of grain they are cut off .
18:24:025:0	Now if it is not so , who can prove me a liar , And make my speech worthless ? ”
