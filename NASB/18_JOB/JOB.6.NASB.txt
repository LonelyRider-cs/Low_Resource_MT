18:6:001:1	Job’s Friends Are No Help
18:6:001:0	Then Job answered ,
18:6:002:0	“ Oh that my grief were actually weighedAnd laid in the balances together with my calamity !
18:6:003:0	For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas ; Therefore my words have been rash .
18:6:004:0	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me , Their poison my spirit drinks ; The terrors of God are arrayed against me .
18:6:005:0	Does the wild donkey bray over his grass , Or does the ox low over his fodder ?
18:6:006:0	Can something tasteless be eaten without salt , Or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
18:6:007:0	My soul refuses to touch them ; They are like loathsome food to me .
18:6:008:0	“ Oh that my request might come to pass , And that God would grant my longing !
18:6:009:0	Would that God were willing to crush me , That He would loose His hand and cut me off !
18:6:010:0	But it is still my consolation , And I rejoice in unsparing pain , That I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
18:6:011:0	What is my strength , that I should wait ? And what is my end , that I should endure ?
18:6:012:0	Is my strength the strength of stones , Or is my flesh bronze ?
18:6:013:0	Is it that my help is not within me , And that deliverance is driven from me ?
18:6:014:0	“ For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend ; So that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty .
18:6:015:0	My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi , Like the torrents of wadis which vanish ,
18:6:016:0	Which are turbid because of ice And into which the snow melts .
18:6:017:0	When they become waterless , they are silent , When it is hot , they vanish from their place .
18:6:018:0	The paths of their course wind along , They go up into nothing and perish .
18:6:019:0	The caravans of Tema looked , The travelers of Sheba hoped for them .
18:6:020:0	They were disappointed for they had trusted , They came there and were confounded .
18:6:021:0	Indeed , you have now become such , You see a terror and are afraid .
18:6:022:0	Have I said , ‘Give me something , ’Or , ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth , ’
18:6:023:0	Or , ‘Deliver me from the hand of the adversary , ’Or , ‘Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants’ ?
18:6:024:0	“ Teach me , and I will be silent ; And show me how I have erred .
18:6:025:0	How painful are honest words ! But what does your argument prove ?
18:6:026:0	Do you intend to reprove my words , When the words of one in despair belong to the wind ?
18:6:027:0	You would even cast lots for the orphansAnd barter over your friend .
18:6:028:0	Now please look at me , And see if I lie to your face .
18:6:029:0	Desist now , let there be no injustice ; Even desist , my righteousness is yet in it .
18:6:030:0	Is there injustice on my tongue ? Cannot my palate discern calamities ?
