18:22:001:1	Eliphaz Accuses and Exhorts Job
18:22:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded ,
18:22:002:0	“ Can a vigorous man be of use to God , Or a wise man be useful to himself ?
18:22:003:0	Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous , Or profit if you make your ways perfect ?
18:22:004:0	Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you , That He enters into judgment against you ?
18:22:005:0	Is not your wickedness great , And your iniquities without end ?
18:22:006:0	For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause , And stripped men naked .
18:22:007:0	To the weary you have given no water to drink , And from the hungry you have withheld bread .
18:22:008:0	But the earth belongs to the mighty man , And the honorable man dwells in it .
18:22:009:0	You have sent widows away empty , And the strength of the orphans has been crushed .
18:22:010:0	Therefore snares surround you , And sudden dread terrifies you ,
18:22:011:0	Or darkness , so that you cannot see , And an abundance of water covers you .
18:22:012:0	“ Is not God in the height of heaven ? Look also at the distant stars , how high they are !
18:22:013:0	You say , ‘What does God know ? Can He judge through the thick darkness ?
18:22:014:0	Clouds are a hiding place for Him , so that He cannot see ; And He walks on the vault of heaven . ’
18:22:015:0	Will you keep to the ancient pathWhich wicked men have trod ,
18:22:016:0	Who were snatched away before their time , Whose foundations were washed away by a river ?
18:22:017:0	They said to God , ‘Depart from us ! ’And ‘What can the Almighty do to them ? ’
18:22:018:0	Yet He filled their houses with good things ; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
18:22:019:0	The righteous see and are glad , And the innocent mock them ,
18:22:020:0	Saying , ‘Truly our adversaries are cut off , And their abundance the fire has consumed . ’
18:22:021:0	“ Yield now and be at peace with Him ; Thereby good will come to you .
18:22:022:0	Please receive instruction from His mouthAnd establish His words in your heart .
18:22:023:0	If you return to the Almighty , you will be restored ; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent ,
18:22:024:0	And place your gold in the dust , And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks ,
18:22:025:0	Then the Almighty will be your goldAnd choice silver to you .
18:22:026:0	For then you will delight in the AlmightyAnd lift up your face to God .
18:22:027:0	You will pray to Him , and He will hear you ; And you will pay your vows .
18:22:028:0	You will also decree a thing , and it will be established for you ; And light will shine on your ways .
18:22:029:0	When you are cast down , you will speak with confidence , And the humble person He will save .
18:22:030:0	He will deliver one who is not innocent , And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands . ”
