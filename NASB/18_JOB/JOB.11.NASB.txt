18:11:001:1	Zophar Rebukes Job
18:11:001:0	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered ,
18:11:002:0	“ Shall a multitude of words go unanswered , And a talkative man be acquitted ?
18:11:003:0	Shall your boasts silence men ? And shall you scoff and none rebuke ?
18:11:004:0	For you have said , ‘My teaching is pure , And I am innocent in your eyes . ’
18:11:005:0	But would that God might speak , And open His lips against you ,
18:11:006:0	And show you the secrets of wisdom ! For sound wisdom has two sides . Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity .
18:11:007:0	“ Can you discover the depths of God ? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty ?
18:11:008:0	They are high as the heavens , what can you do ? Deeper than Sheol , what can you know ?
18:11:009:0	Its measure is longer than the earthAnd broader than the sea .
18:11:010:0	If He passes by or shuts up , Or calls an assembly , who can restrain Him ?
18:11:011:0	For He knows false men , And He sees iniquity without investigating .
18:11:012:0	An idiot will become intelligentWhen the foal of a wild donkey is born a man .
18:11:013:0	“ If you would direct your heart rightAnd spread out your hand to Him ,
18:11:014:0	If iniquity is in your hand , put it far away , And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents ;
18:11:015:0	Then , indeed , you could lift up your face without moral defect , And you would be steadfast and not fear .
18:11:016:0	For you would forget your trouble , As waters that have passed by , you would remember it .
18:11:017:0	Your life would be brighter than noonday ; Darkness would be like the morning .
18:11:018:0	Then you would trust , because there is hope ; And you would look around and rest securely .
18:11:019:0	You would lie down and none would disturb you , And many would entreat your favor .
18:11:020:0	But the eyes of the wicked will fail , And there will be no escape for them ; And their hope is to breathe their last . ”
