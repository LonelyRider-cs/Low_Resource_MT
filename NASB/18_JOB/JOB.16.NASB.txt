18:16:001:1	Job Says Friends Are Sorry Comforters
18:16:001:0	Then Job answered ,
18:16:002:0	“ I have heard many such things ; Sorry comforters are you all .
18:16:003:0	Is there no limit to windy words ? Or what plagues you that you answer ?
18:16:004:0	I too could speak like you , If I were in your place . I could compose words against youAnd shake my head at you .
18:16:002:1	Job Says God Shattered Him
18:16:005:0	I could strengthen you with my mouth , And the solace of my lips could lessen your pain .
18:16:006:0	“ If I speak , my pain is not lessened , And if I hold back , what has left me ?
18:16:007:0	But now He has exhausted me ; You have laid waste all my company .
18:16:008:0	You have shriveled me up , It has become a witness ; And my leanness rises up against me , It testifies to my face .
18:16:009:0	His anger has torn me and hunted me down , He has gnashed at me with His teeth ; My adversary glares at me .
18:16:010:0	They have gaped at me with their mouth , They have slapped me on the cheek with contempt ; They have massed themselves against me .
18:16:011:0	God hands me over to ruffiansAnd tosses me into the hands of the wicked .
18:16:012:0	I was at ease , but He shattered me , And He has grasped me by the neck and shaken me to pieces ; He has also set me up as His target .
18:16:013:0	His arrows surround me . Without mercy He splits my kidneys open ; He pours out my gall on the ground .
18:16:014:0	He breaks through me with breach after breach ; He runs at me like a warrior .
18:16:015:0	I have sewed sackcloth over my skinAnd thrust my horn in the dust .
18:16:016:0	My face is flushed from weeping , And deep darkness is on my eyelids ,
18:16:017:0	Although there is no violence in my hands , And my prayer is pure .
18:16:018:0	“ O earth , do not cover my blood , And let there be no resting place for my cry .
18:16:019:0	Even now , behold , my witness is in heaven , And my advocate is on high .
18:16:020:0	My friends are my scoffers ; My eye weeps to God .
18:16:021:0	O that a man might plead with GodAs a man with his neighbor !
18:16:022:0	For when a few years are past , I shall go the way of no return .
