18:14:001:1	Job Speaks of the Finality of Death
18:14:001:0	“ Man , who is born of woman , Is short-lived and full of turmoil .
18:14:002:0	Like a flower he comes forth and withers . He also flees like a shadow and does not remain .
18:14:003:0	You also open Your eyes on himAnd bring him into judgment with Yourself .
18:14:004:0	Who can make the clean out of the unclean ? No one !
18:14:005:0	Since his days are determined , The number of his months is with You ; And his limits You have set so that he cannot pass .
18:14:006:0	Turn Your gaze from him that he may rest , Until he fulfills his day like a hired man .
18:14:007:0	“ For there is hope for a tree , When it is cut down , that it will sprout again , And its shoots will not fail .
18:14:008:0	Though its roots grow old in the groundAnd its stump dies in the dry soil ,
18:14:009:0	At the scent of water it will flourishAnd put forth sprigs like a plant .
18:14:010:0	But man dies and lies prostrate . Man expires , and where is he ?
18:14:011:0	As water evaporates from the sea , And a river becomes parched and dried up ,
18:14:012:0	So man lies down and does not rise . Until the heavens are no longer , He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep .
18:14:013:0	“ Oh that You would hide me in Sheol , That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns to You , That You would set a limit for me and remember me !
18:14:014:0	If a man dies , will he live again ? All the days of my struggle I will waitUntil my change comes .
18:14:015:0	You will call , and I will answer You ; You will long for the work of Your hands .
18:14:016:0	For now You number my steps , You do not observe my sin .
18:14:017:0	My transgression is sealed up in a bag , And You wrap up my iniquity .
18:14:018:0	“ But the falling mountain crumbles away , And the rock moves from its place ;
18:14:019:0	Water wears away stones , Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth ; So You destroy man’s hope .
18:14:020:0	You forever overpower him and he departs ; You change his appearance and send him away .
18:14:021:0	His sons achieve honor , but he does not know it ; Or they become insignificant , but he does not perceive it .
18:14:022:0	But his body pains him , And he mourns only for himself . ”
