18:39:001:1	God Speaks of Nature and Its Beings
18:39:001:0	“ Do you know the time the mountain goats give birth ? Do you observe the calving of the deer ?
18:39:002:0	Can you count the months they fulfill , Or do you know the time they give birth ?
18:39:003:0	They kneel down , they bring forth their young , They get rid of their labor pains .
18:39:004:0	Their offspring become strong , they grow up in the open field ; They leave and do not return to them .
18:39:005:0	“ Who sent out the wild donkey free ? And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey ,
18:39:006:0	To whom I gave the wilderness for a homeAnd the salt land for his dwelling place ?
18:39:007:0	He scorns the tumult of the city , The shoutings of the driver he does not hear .
18:39:008:0	He explores the mountains for his pastureAnd searches after every green thing .
18:39:009:0	Will the wild ox consent to serve you , Or will he spend the night at your manger ?
18:39:010:0	Can you bind the wild ox in a furrow with ropes , Or will he harrow the valleys after you ?
18:39:011:0	Will you trust him because his strength is greatAnd leave your labor to him ?
18:39:012:0	Will you have faith in him that he will return your grainAnd gather it from your threshing floor ?
18:39:013:0	“ The ostriches’ wings flap joyouslyWith the pinion and plumage of love ,
18:39:014:0	For she abandons her eggs to the earthAnd warms them in the dust ,
18:39:015:0	And she forgets that a foot may crush them , Or that a wild beast may trample them .
18:39:016:0	She treats her young cruelly , as if they were not hers ; Though her labor be in vain , she is unconcerned ;
18:39:017:0	Because God has made her forget wisdom , And has not given her a share of understanding .
18:39:018:0	When she lifts herself on high , She laughs at the horse and his rider .
18:39:019:0	“ Do you give the horse his might ? Do you clothe his neck with a mane ?
18:39:020:0	Do you make him leap like the locust ? His majestic snorting is terrible .
18:39:021:0	He paws in the valley , and rejoices in his strength ; He goes out to meet the weapons .
18:39:022:0	He laughs at fear and is not dismayed ; And he does not turn back from the sword .
18:39:023:0	The quiver rattles against him , The flashing spear and javelin .
18:39:024:0	With shaking and rage he races over the ground , And he does not stand still at the voice of the trumpet .
18:39:025:0	As often as the trumpet sounds he says , ‘Aha ! ’And he scents the battle from afar , And the thunder of the captains and the war cry .
18:39:026:0	“ Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars , Stretching his wings toward the south ?
18:39:027:0	Is it at your command that the eagle mounts upAnd makes his nest on high ?
18:39:028:0	On the cliff he dwells and lodges , Upon the rocky crag , an inaccessible place .
18:39:029:0	From there he spies out food ; His eyes see it from afar .
18:39:030:0	His young ones also suck up blood ; And where the slain are , there is he . ”
