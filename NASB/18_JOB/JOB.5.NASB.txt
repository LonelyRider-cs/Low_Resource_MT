18:5:001:1	God Is Just
18:5:001:0	“ Call now , is there anyone who will answer you ? And to which of the holy ones will you turn ?
18:5:002:0	For anger slays the foolish man , And jealousy kills the simple .
18:5:003:0	I have seen the foolish taking root , And I cursed his abode immediately .
18:5:004:0	His sons are far from safety , They are even oppressed in the gate , And there is no deliverer .
18:5:005:0	His harvest the hungry devourAnd take it to a place of thorns , And the schemer is eager for their wealth .
18:5:006:0	For affliction does not come from the dust , Nor does trouble sprout from the ground ,
18:5:007:0	For man is born for trouble , As sparks fly upward .
18:5:008:0	“ But as for me , I would seek God , And I would place my cause before God ;
18:5:009:0	Who does great and unsearchable things , Wonders without number .
18:5:010:0	He gives rain on the earthAnd sends water on the fields ,
18:5:011:0	So that He sets on high those who are lowly , And those who mourn are lifted to safety .
18:5:012:0	He frustrates the plotting of the shrewd , So that their hands cannot attain success .
18:5:013:0	He captures the wise by their own shrewdness , And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted .
18:5:014:0	By day they meet with darkness , And grope at noon as in the night .
18:5:015:0	But He saves from the sword of their mouth , And the poor from the hand of the mighty .
18:5:016:0	So the helpless has hope , And unrighteousness must shut its mouth .
18:5:017:0	“ Behold , how happy is the man whom God reproves , So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty .
18:5:018:0	For He inflicts pain , and gives relief ; He wounds , and His hands also heal .
18:5:019:0	From six troubles He will deliver you , Even in seven evil will not touch you .
18:5:020:0	In famine He will redeem you from death , And in war from the power of the sword .
18:5:021:0	You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes .
18:5:022:0	You will laugh at violence and famine , And you will not be afraid of wild beasts .
18:5:023:0	For you will be in league with the stones of the field , And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you .
18:5:024:0	You will know that your tent is secure , For you will visit your abode and fear no loss .
18:5:025:0	You will know also that your descendants will be many , And your offspring as the grass of the earth .
18:5:026:0	You will come to the grave in full vigor , Like the stacking of grain in its season .
18:5:027:0	Behold this ; we have investigated it , and so it is . Hear it , and know for yourself . ”
