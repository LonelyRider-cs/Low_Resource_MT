18:32:001:1	Elihu in Anger Rebukes Job
18:32:001:0	Then these three men ceased answering Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
18:32:002:0	But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the family of Ram burned ; against Job his anger burned because he justified himself before God .
18:32:003:0	And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job .
18:32:004:0	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he .
18:32:005:0	And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned .
18:32:006:0	So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said , “ I am young in years and you are old ; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think .
18:32:007:0	I thought age should speak , And increased years should teach wisdom .
18:32:008:0	But it is a spirit in man , And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding .
18:32:009:0	The abundant in years may not be wise , Nor may elders understand justice .
18:32:010:0	So I say , ‘Listen to me , I too will tell what I think . ’
18:32:011:0	“ Behold , I waited for your words , I listened to your reasonings , While you pondered what to say .
18:32:012:0	I even paid close attention to you ; Indeed , there was no one who refuted Job , Not one of you who answered his words .
18:32:013:0	Do not say , ‘We have found wisdom ; God will rout him , not man . ’
18:32:014:0	For he has not arranged his words against me , Nor will I reply to him with your arguments .
18:32:015:0	“ They are dismayed , they no longer answer ; Words have failed them .
18:32:016:0	Shall I wait , because they do not speak , Because they stop and no longer answer ?
18:32:017:0	I too will answer my share , I also will tell my opinion .
18:32:018:0	For I am full of words ; The spirit within me constrains me .
18:32:019:0	Behold , my belly is like unvented wine , Like new wineskins it is about to burst .
18:32:020:0	Let me speak that I may get relief ; Let me open my lips and answer .
18:32:021:0	Let me now be partial to no one , Nor flatter any man .
18:32:022:0	For I do not know how to flatter , Else my Maker would soon take me away .
