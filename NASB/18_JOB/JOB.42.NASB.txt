18:42:001:1	Job’s Confession
18:42:001:0	Then Job answered the Lord and said ,
18:42:002:0	“ I know that You can do all things , And that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted .
18:42:003:0	‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge ? ’Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand , Things too wonderful for me , which I did not know .
18:42:004:0	‘Hear , now , and I will speak ; I will ask You , and You instruct me . ’
18:42:005:0	I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear ; But now my eye sees You ;
18:42:002:1	God Displeased with Job’s Friends
18:42:006:0	Therefore I retract , And I repent in dust and ashes . ”
18:42:007:0	It came about after the Lord had spoken these words to Job , that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , “ My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends , because you have not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has .
18:42:008:0	Now therefore , take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams , and go to My servant Job , and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves , and My servant Job will pray for you . For I will accept him so that I may not do with you according to your folly , because you have not spoken of Me what is right , as My servant Job has . ”
18:42:003:1	God Restores Job’s Fortunes
18:42:009:0	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord told them ; and the Lord accepted Job .
18:42:010:0	The Lord restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends , and the Lord increased all that Job had twofold .
18:42:011:0	Then all his brothers and all his sisters and all who had known him before came to him , and they ate bread with him in his house ; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversities that the Lord had brought on him . And each one gave him one piece of money , and each a ring of gold .
18:42:012:0	The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning ; and he had 14 , 000 sheep and 6 , 000 camels and 1 , 000 yoke of oxen and 1 , 000 female donkeys .
18:42:013:0	He had seven sons and three daughters .
18:42:014:0	He named the first Jemimah , and the second Keziah , and the third Keren-happuch .
18:42:015:0	In all the land no women were found so fair as Job’s daughters ; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers .
18:42:016:0	After this , Job lived 140 years , and saw his sons and his grandsons , four generations .
18:42:017:0	And Job died , an old man and full of days .
