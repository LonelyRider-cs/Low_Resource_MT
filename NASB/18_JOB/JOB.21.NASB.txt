18:21:001:1	Job Says God Will Deal with the Wicked
18:21:001:0	Then Job answered ,
18:21:002:0	“ Listen carefully to my speech , And let this be your way of consolation .
18:21:003:0	Bear with me that I may speak ; Then after I have spoken , you may mock .
18:21:004:0	As for me , is my complaint to man ? And why should I not be impatient ?
18:21:005:0	Look at me , and be astonished , And put your hand over your mouth .
18:21:006:0	Even when I remember , I am disturbed , And horror takes hold of my flesh .
18:21:007:0	Why do the wicked still live , Continue on , also become very powerful ?
18:21:008:0	Their descendants are established with them in their sight , And their offspring before their eyes ,
18:21:009:0	Their houses are safe from fear , And the rod of God is not on them .
18:21:010:0	His ox mates without fail ; His cow calves and does not abort .
18:21:011:0	They send forth their little ones like the flock , And their children skip about .
18:21:012:0	They sing to the timbrel and harpAnd rejoice at the sound of the flute .
18:21:013:0	They spend their days in prosperity , And suddenly they go down to Sheol .
18:21:014:0	They say to God , ‘Depart from us ! We do not even desire the knowledge of Your ways .
18:21:015:0	Who is the Almighty , that we should serve Him , And what would we gain if we entreat Him ? ’
18:21:016:0	Behold , their prosperity is not in their hand ; The counsel of the wicked is far from me .
18:21:017:0	“ How often is the lamp of the wicked put out , Or does their calamity fall on them ? Does God apportion destruction in His anger ?
18:21:018:0	Are they as straw before the wind , And like chaff which the storm carries away ?
18:21:019:0	You say , ‘God stores away a man’s iniquity for his sons . ’Let God repay him so that he may know it .
18:21:020:0	Let his own eyes see his decay , And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
18:21:021:0	For what does he care for his household after him , When the number of his months is cut off ?
18:21:022:0	Can anyone teach God knowledge , In that He judges those on high ?
18:21:023:0	One dies in his full strength , Being wholly at ease and satisfied ;
18:21:024:0	His sides are filled out with fat , And the marrow of his bones is moist ,
18:21:025:0	While another dies with a bitter soul , Never even tasting anything good .
18:21:026:0	Together they lie down in the dust , And worms cover them .
18:21:027:0	“ Behold , I know your thoughts , And the plans by which you would wrong me .
18:21:028:0	For you say , ‘Where is the house of the nobleman , And where is the tent , the dwelling places of the wicked ? ’
18:21:029:0	Have you not asked wayfaring men , And do you not recognize their witness ?
18:21:030:0	For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity ; They will be led forth at the day of fury .
18:21:031:0	Who will confront him with his actions , And who will repay him for what he has done ?
18:21:032:0	While he is carried to the grave , Men will keep watch over his tomb .
18:21:033:0	The clods of the valley will gently cover him ; Moreover , all men will follow after him , While countless ones go before him .
18:21:034:0	How then will you vainly comfort me , For your answers remain full of falsehood ? ”
