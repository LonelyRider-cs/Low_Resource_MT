18:31:001:1	Job Asserts His Integrity
18:31:001:0	“ I have made a covenant with my eyes ; How then could I gaze at a virgin ?
18:31:002:0	And what is the portion of God from aboveOr the heritage of the Almighty from on high ?
18:31:003:0	Is it not calamity to the unjustAnd disaster to those who work iniquity ?
18:31:004:0	Does He not see my waysAnd number all my steps ?
18:31:005:0	“ If I have walked with falsehood , And my foot has hastened after deceit ,
18:31:006:0	Let Him weigh me with accurate scales , And let God know my integrity .
18:31:007:0	If my step has turned from the way , Or my heart followed my eyes , Or if any spot has stuck to my hands ,
18:31:008:0	Let me sow and another eat , And let my crops be uprooted .
18:31:009:0	“ If my heart has been enticed by a woman , Or I have lurked at my neighbor’s doorway ,
18:31:010:0	May my wife grind for another , And let others kneel down over her .
18:31:011:0	For that would be a lustful crime ; Moreover , it would be an iniquity punishable by judges .
18:31:012:0	For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon , And would uproot all my increase .
18:31:013:0	“ If I have despised the claim of my male or female slavesWhen they filed a complaint against me ,
18:31:014:0	What then could I do when God arises ? And when He calls me to account , what will I answer Him ?
18:31:015:0	Did not He who made me in the womb make him , And the same one fashion us in the womb ?
18:31:016:0	“ If I have kept the poor from their desire , Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ,
18:31:017:0	Or have eaten my morsel alone , And the orphan has not shared it
18:31:018:0	( But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , And from infancy I guided her ) ,
18:31:019:0	If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing , Or that the needy had no covering ,
18:31:020:0	If his loins have not thanked me , And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep ,
18:31:021:0	If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan , Because I saw I had support in the gate ,
18:31:022:0	Let my shoulder fall from the socket , And my arm be broken off at the elbow .
18:31:023:0	For calamity from God is a terror to me , And because of His majesty I can do nothing .
18:31:024:0	“ If I have put my confidence in gold , And called fine gold my trust ,
18:31:025:0	If I have gloated because my wealth was great , And because my hand had secured so much ;
18:31:026:0	If I have looked at the sun when it shoneOr the moon going in splendor ,
18:31:027:0	And my heart became secretly enticed , And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth ,
18:31:028:0	That too would have been an iniquity calling for judgment , For I would have denied God above .
18:31:029:0	“ Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy , Or exulted when evil befell him ?
18:31:030:0	No , I have not allowed my mouth to sinBy asking for his life in a curse .
18:31:031:0	Have the men of my tent not said , ‘Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat’ ?
18:31:032:0	The alien has not lodged outside , For I have opened my doors to the traveler .
18:31:033:0	Have I covered my transgressions like Adam , By hiding my iniquity in my bosom ,
18:31:034:0	Because I feared the great multitude , And the contempt of families terrified me , And kept silent and did not go out of doors ?
18:31:035:0	Oh that I had one to hear me ! Behold , here is my signature ; Let the Almighty answer me ! And the indictment which my adversary has written ,
18:31:036:0	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder , I would bind it to myself like a crown .
18:31:037:0	I would declare to Him the number of my steps ; Like a prince I would approach Him .
18:31:038:0	“ If my land cries out against me , And its furrows weep together ;
18:31:039:0	If I have eaten its fruit without money , Or have caused its owners to lose their lives ,
18:31:040:0	Let briars grow instead of wheat , And stinkweed instead of barley . ” The words of Job are ended .
