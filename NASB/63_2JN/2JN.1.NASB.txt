63:1:001:1	Walk According to His Commandments
63:1:001:0	The elder to the chosen lady and her children , whom I love in truth ; and not only I , but also all who know the truth ,
63:1:002:0	for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever :
63:1:003:0	Grace , mercy and peace will be with us , from God the Father and from Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
63:1:004:0	I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth , just as we have received commandment to do from the Father .
63:1:005:0	Now I ask you , lady , not as though I were writing to you a new commandment , but the one which we have had from the beginning , that we love one another .
63:1:006:0	And this is love , that we walk according to His commandments . This is the commandment , just as you have heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
63:1:007:0	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh . This is the deceiver and the antichrist .
63:1:008:0	Watch yourselves , that you do not lose what we have accomplished , but that you may receive a full reward .
63:1:009:0	Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ , does not have God ; the one who abides in the teaching , he has both the Father and the Son .
63:1:010:0	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your house , and do not give him a greeting ;
63:1:011:0	for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds .
63:1:012:0	Though I have many things to write to you , I do not want to do so with paper and ink ; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face , so that your joy may be made full .
63:1:013:0	The children of your chosen sister greet you .
