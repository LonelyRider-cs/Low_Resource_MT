58:11:001:1	The Triumphs of Faith
58:11:001:0	Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for , the conviction of things not seen .
58:11:002:0	For by it the men of old gained approval .
58:11:003:0	By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God , so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible .
58:11:004:0	By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain , through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous , God testifying about his gifts , and through faith , though he is dead , he still speaks .
58:11:005:0	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death ; and he was not found because God took him up ; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God .
58:11:006:0	And without faith it is impossible to please Him , for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him .
58:11:007:0	By faith Noah , being warned by God about things not yet seen , in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household , by which he condemned the world , and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
58:11:008:0	By faith Abraham , when he was called , obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance ; and he went out , not knowing where he was going .
58:11:009:0	By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a foreign land , dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob , fellow heirs of the same promise ;
58:11:010:0	for he was looking for the city which has foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58:11:011:0	By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive , even beyond the proper time of life , since she considered Him faithful who had promised .
58:11:012:0	Therefore there was born even of one man , and him as good as dead at that , as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number , and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore .
58:11:013:0	All these died in faith , without receiving the promises , but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance , and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth .
58:11:014:0	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own .
58:11:015:0	And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had opportunity to return .
58:11:016:0	But as it is , they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God ; for He has prepared a city for them .
58:11:017:0	By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son ;
58:11:018:0	it was he to whom it was said , “ In Isaac your descendants shall be called . ”
58:11:019:0	He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead , from which he also received him back as a type .
58:11:020:0	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even regarding things to come .
58:11:021:0	By faith Jacob , as he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff .
58:11:022:0	By faith Joseph , when he was dying , made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel , and gave orders concerning his bones .
58:11:023:0	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw he was a beautiful child ; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict .
58:11:024:0	By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter ,
58:11:025:0	choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin ,
58:11:026:0	considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he was looking to the reward .
58:11:027:0	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing Him who is unseen .
58:11:028:0	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood , so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them .
58:11:029:0	By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land ; and the Egyptians , when they attempted it , were drowned .
58:11:030:0	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days .
58:11:031:0	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient , after she had welcomed the spies in peace .
58:11:032:0	And what more shall I say ? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets ,
58:11:033:0	who by faith conquered kingdoms , performed acts of righteousness , obtained promises , shut the mouths of lions ,
58:11:034:0	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , became mighty in war , put foreign armies to flight .
58:11:035:0	Women received back their dead by resurrection ; and others were tortured , not accepting their release , so that they might obtain a better resurrection ;
58:11:036:0	and others experienced mockings and scourgings , yes , also chains and imprisonment .
58:11:037:0	They were stoned , they were sawn in two , they were tempted , they were put to death with the sword ; they went about in sheepskins , in goatskins , being destitute , afflicted , ill-treated
58:11:038:0	( men of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground .
58:11:039:0	And all these , having gained approval through their faith , did not receive what was promised ,
58:11:040:0	because God had provided something better for us , so that apart from us they would not be made perfect .
