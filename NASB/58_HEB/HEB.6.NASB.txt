58:6:001:1	The Peril of Falling Away
58:6:001:0	Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ , let us press on to maturity , not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God ,
58:6:002:0	of instruction about washings and laying on of hands , and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment .
58:6:003:0	And this we will do , if God permits .
58:6:004:0	For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
58:6:005:0	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come ,
58:6:006:0	and then have fallen away , it is impossible to renew them again to repentance , since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame .
58:6:007:0	For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled , receives a blessing from God ;
58:6:002:1	Better Things for You
58:6:008:0	but if it yields thorns and thistles , it is worthless and close to being cursed , and it ends up being burned .
58:6:009:0	But , beloved , we are convinced of better things concerning you , and things that accompany salvation , though we are speaking in this way .
58:6:010:0	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name , in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints .
58:6:011:0	And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end ,
58:6:012:0	so that you will not be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
58:6:013:0	For when God made the promise to Abraham , since He could swear by no one greater , He swore by Himself ,
58:6:014:0	saying , “ I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you . ”
58:6:015:0	And so , having patiently waited , he obtained the promise .
58:6:016:0	For men swear by one greater than themselves , and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute .
58:6:017:0	In the same way God , desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose , interposed with an oath ,
58:6:018:0	so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us .
58:6:019:0	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil ,
58:6:020:0	where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us , having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek .
