58:9:001:1	The Old and the New
58:9:001:0	Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary .
58:9:002:0	For there was a tabernacle prepared , the outer one , in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread ; this is called the holy place .
58:9:003:0	Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies ,
58:9:004:0	having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold , in which was a golden jar holding the manna , and Aaron’s rod which budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
58:9:005:0	and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat ; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail .
58:9:006:0	Now when these things have been so prepared , the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship ,
58:9:007:0	but into the second , only the high priest enters once a year , not without taking blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance .
58:9:008:0	The Holy Spirit is signifying this , that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing ,
58:9:009:0	which is a symbol for the present time . Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience ,
58:9:010:0	since they relate only to food and drink and various washings , regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation .
58:9:011:0	But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come , He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this creation ;
58:9:012:0	and not through the blood of goats and calves , but through His own blood , He entered the holy place once for all , having obtained eternal redemption .
58:9:013:0	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh ,
58:9:014:0	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God , cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
58:9:015:0	For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant , so that , since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant , those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
58:9:016:0	For where a covenant is , there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it .
58:9:017:0	For a covenant is valid only when men are dead , for it is never in force while the one who made it lives .
58:9:018:0	Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood .
58:9:019:0	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
58:9:020:0	saying , “ This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you . ”
58:9:021:0	And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood .
58:9:022:0	And according to the Law , one may almost say , all things are cleansed with blood , and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
58:9:023:0	Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58:9:024:0	For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands , a mere copy of the true one , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ;
58:9:025:0	nor was it that He would offer Himself often , as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own .
58:9:026:0	Otherwise , He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world ; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself .
58:9:027:0	And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment ,
58:9:028:0	so Christ also , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin , to those who eagerly await Him .
