58:2:001:1	Give Heed
58:2:001:0	For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard , so that we do not drift away from it .
58:2:002:0	For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable , and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty ,
58:2:003:0	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation ? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord , it was confirmed to us by those who heard ,
58:2:002:1	Earth Subject to Man
58:2:004:0	God also testifying with them , both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will .
58:2:005:0	For He did not subject to angels the world to come , concerning which we are speaking .
58:2:006:0	But one has testified somewhere , saying , “ What is man , that You remember him ? Or the son of man , that You are concerned about him ?
58:2:007:0	You have made him for a little while lower than the angels ; You have crowned him with glory and honor , And have appointed him over the works of Your hands ;
58:2:003:1	Jesus Briefly Humbled
58:2:008:0	You have put all things in subjection under his feet . ” For in subjecting all things to him , He left nothing that is not subject to him . But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him .
58:2:009:0	But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels , namely , Jesus , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone .
58:2:010:0	For it was fitting for Him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many sons to glory , to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings .
58:2:011:0	For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father ; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
58:2:012:0	saying , “ I will proclaim Your name to My brethren , In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your praise . ”
58:2:013:0	And again , “ I will put My trust in Him . ” And again , “ Behold , I and the children whom God has given Me . ”
58:2:014:0	Therefore , since the children share in flesh and blood , He Himself likewise also partook of the same , that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death , that is , the devil ,
58:2:015:0	and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives .
58:2:016:0	For assuredly He does not give help to angels , but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham .
58:2:017:0	Therefore , He had to be made like His brethren in all things , so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people .
58:2:018:0	For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered , He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted .
