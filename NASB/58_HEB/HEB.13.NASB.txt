58:13:001:1	The Changeless Christ
58:13:001:0	Let love of the brethren continue .
58:13:002:0	Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers , for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it .
58:13:003:0	Remember the prisoners , as though in prison with them , and those who are ill-treated , since you yourselves also are in the body .
58:13:004:0	Marriage is to be held in honor among all , and the marriage bed is to be undefiled ; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge .
58:13:005:0	Make sure that your character is free from the love of money , being content with what you have ; for He Himself has said , “ I will never desert you , nor will I ever forsake you , ”
58:13:006:0	so that we confidently say , “ The Lord is my helper , I will not be afraid . What will man do to me ? ”
58:13:007:0	Remember those who led you , who spoke the word of God to you ; and considering the result of their conduct , imitate their faith .
58:13:008:0	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
58:13:009:0	Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings ; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace , not by foods , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited .
58:13:010:0	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat .
58:13:011:0	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside the camp .
58:13:012:0	Therefore Jesus also , that He might sanctify the people through His own blood , suffered outside the gate .
58:13:013:0	So , let us go out to Him outside the camp , bearing His reproach .
58:13:002:1	God-pleasing Sacrifices
58:13:014:0	For here we do not have a lasting city , but we are seeking the city which is to come .
58:13:015:0	Through Him then , let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God , that is , the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name .
58:13:016:0	And do not neglect doing good and sharing , for with such sacrifices God is pleased .
58:13:017:0	Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account . Let them do this with joy and not with grief , for this would be unprofitable for you .
58:13:018:0	Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a good conscience , desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things .
58:13:003:1	Benediction
58:13:019:0	And I urge you all the more to do this , so that I may be restored to you the sooner .
58:13:020:0	Now the God of peace , who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant , even Jesus our Lord ,
58:13:021:0	equip you in every good thing to do His will , working in us that which is pleasing in His sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
58:13:022:0	But I urge you , brethren , bear with this word of exhortation , for I have written to you briefly .
58:13:023:0	Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released , with whom , if he comes soon , I will see you .
58:13:024:0	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints . Those from Italy greet you .
58:13:025:0	Grace be with you all .
