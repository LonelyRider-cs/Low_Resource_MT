58:7:001:1	Melchizedek’s Priesthood Like Christ’s
58:7:001:0	For this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of the Most High God , who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
58:7:002:0	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils , was first of all , by the translation of his name , king of righteousness , and then also king of Salem , which is king of peace .
58:7:003:0	Without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God , he remains a priest perpetually .
58:7:004:0	Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth of the choicest spoils .
58:7:005:0	And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people , that is , from their brethren , although these are descended from Abraham .
58:7:006:0	But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises .
58:7:007:0	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater .
58:7:008:0	In this case mortal men receive tithes , but in that case one receives them , of whom it is witnessed that he lives on .
58:7:009:0	And , so to speak , through Abraham even Levi , who received tithes , paid tithes ,
58:7:010:0	for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him .
58:7:011:0	Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood ( for on the basis of it the people received the Law ) , what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek , and not be designated according to the order of Aaron ?
58:7:012:0	For when the priesthood is changed , of necessity there takes place a change of law also .
58:7:013:0	For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar .
58:7:014:0	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah , a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests .
58:7:015:0	And this is clearer still , if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek ,
58:7:016:0	who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement , but according to the power of an indestructible life .
58:7:017:0	For it is attested of Him , “ You are a priest foreverAccording to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58:7:018:0	For , on the one hand , there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
58:7:019:0	( for the Law made nothing perfect ) , and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
58:7:020:0	And inasmuch as it was not without an oath
58:7:021:0	( for they indeed became priests without an oath , but He with an oath through the One who said to Him , “ The Lord has swornAnd will not change His mind , ‘You are a priest forever’ ” ) ;
58:7:022:0	so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant .
58:7:023:0	The former priests , on the one hand , existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing ,
58:7:024:0	but Jesus , on the other hand , because He continues forever , holds His priesthood permanently .
58:7:025:0	Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him , since He always lives to make intercession for them .
58:7:026:0	For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest , holy , innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens ;
58:7:027:0	who does not need daily , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices , first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people , because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself .
58:7:028:0	For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak , but the word of the oath , which came after the Law , appoints a Son , made perfect forever .
