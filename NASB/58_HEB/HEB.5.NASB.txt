58:5:001:1	The Perfect High Priest
58:5:001:0	For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God , in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins ;
58:5:002:0	he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided , since he himself also is beset with weakness ;
58:5:003:0	and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins , as for the people , so also for himself .
58:5:004:0	And no one takes the honor to himself , but receives it when he is called by God , even as Aaron was .
58:5:005:0	So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest , but He who said to Him , “ You are My Son , Today I have begotten You ” ;
58:5:006:0	just as He says also in another passage , “ You are a priest foreverAccording to the order of Melchizedek . ”
58:5:007:0	In the days of His flesh , He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death , and He was heard because of His piety .
58:5:008:0	Although He was a Son , He learned obedience from the things which He suffered .
58:5:009:0	And having been made perfect , He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation ,
58:5:010:0	being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
58:5:011:0	Concerning him we have much to say , and it is hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .
58:5:012:0	For though by this time you ought to be teachers , you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God , and you have come to need milk and not solid food .
58:5:013:0	For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness , for he is an infant .
58:5:014:0	But solid food is for the mature , who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil .
