58:4:001:1	The Believer’s Rest
58:4:001:0	Therefore , let us fear if , while a promise remains of entering His rest , any one of you may seem to have come short of it .
58:4:002:0	For indeed we have had good news preached to us , just as they also ; but the word they heard did not profit them , because it was not united by faith in those who heard .
58:4:003:0	For we who have believed enter that rest , just as He has said , “ As I swore in My wrath , They shall not enter My rest , ” although His works were finished from the foundation of the world .
58:4:004:0	For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all His works ” ;
58:4:005:0	and again in this passage , “ They shall not enter My rest . ”
58:4:006:0	Therefore , since it remains for some to enter it , and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience ,
58:4:007:0	He again fixes a certain day , “ Today , ” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before , “ Today if you hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts . ”
58:4:008:0	For if Joshua had given them rest , He would not have spoken of another day after that .
58:4:009:0	So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God .
58:4:010:0	For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from His .
58:4:011:0	Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest , so that no one will fall , through following the same example of disobedience .
58:4:012:0	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword , and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit , of both joints and marrow , and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
58:4:013:0	And there is no creature hidden from His sight , but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do .
58:4:014:0	Therefore , since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession .
58:4:015:0	For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses , but One who has been tempted in all things as we are , yet without sin .
58:4:016:0	Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace , so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need .
