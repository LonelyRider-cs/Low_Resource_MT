58:12:001:1	Jesus , the Example
58:12:001:0	Therefore , since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us , let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us , and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us ,
58:12:002:0	fixing our eyes on Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy set before Him endured the cross , despising the shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
58:12:002:1	A Father’s Discipline
58:12:003:0	For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself , so that you will not grow weary and lose heart .
58:12:004:0	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin ;
58:12:005:0	and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons , “ My son , do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord , Nor faint when you are reproved by Him ;
58:12:006:0	For those whom the Lord loves He disciplines , And He scourges every son whom He receives . ”
58:12:007:0	It is for discipline that you endure ; God deals with you as with sons ; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
58:12:008:0	But if you are without discipline , of which all have become partakers , then you are illegitimate children and not sons .
58:12:009:0	Furthermore , we had earthly fathers to discipline us , and we respected them ; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits , and live ?
58:12:010:0	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them , but He disciplines us for our good , so that we may share His holiness .
58:12:011:0	All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful , but sorrowful ; yet to those who have been trained by it , afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness .
58:12:012:0	Therefore , strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble ,
58:12:013:0	and make straight paths for your feet , so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint , but rather be healed .
58:12:014:0	Pursue peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord .
58:12:015:0	See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God ; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble , and by it many be defiled ;
58:12:016:0	that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau , who sold his own birthright for a single meal .
58:12:003:1	Contrast of Sinai and Zion
58:12:017:0	For you know that even afterwards , when he desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for repentance , though he sought for it with tears .
58:12:018:0	For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire , and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind ,
58:12:019:0	and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them .
58:12:020:0	For they could not bear the command , “ If even a beast touches the mountain , it will be stoned . ”
58:12:021:0	And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , “ I am full of fear and trembling . ”
58:12:022:0	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to myriads of angels ,
58:12:023:0	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , and to God , the Judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
58:12:004:1	The Unshaken Kingdom
58:12:024:0	and to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood , which speaks better than the blood of Abel .
58:12:025:0	See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking . For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth , much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven .
58:12:026:0	And His voice shook the earth then , but now He has promised , saying , “ Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heaven . ”
58:12:027:0	This expression , “ Yet once more , ” denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken , as of created things , so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain .
58:12:028:0	Therefore , since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken , let us show gratitude , by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe ;
58:12:029:0	for our God is a consuming fire .
