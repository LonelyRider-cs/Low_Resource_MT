58:3:001:1	Jesus Our High Priest
58:3:001:0	Therefore , holy brethren , partakers of a heavenly calling , consider Jesus , the Apostle and High Priest of our confession ;
58:3:002:0	He was faithful to Him who appointed Him , as Moses also was in all His house .
58:3:003:0	For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house .
58:3:004:0	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .
58:3:005:0	Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later ;
58:3:006:0	but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are , if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end .
58:3:007:0	Therefore , just as the Holy Spirit says , “ Today if you hear His voice ,
58:3:008:0	Do not harden your hearts as when they provoked Me , As in the day of trial in the wilderness ,
58:3:009:0	Where your fathers tried Me by testing Me , And saw My works for forty years .
58:3:010:0	Therefore I was angry with this generation , And said , ‘They always go astray in their heart , And they did not know My ways’ ;
58:3:002:1	The Peril of Unbelief
58:3:011:0	As I swore in My wrath , ‘They shall not enter My rest . ’ ”
58:3:012:0	Take care , brethren , that there not be in any one of you an evil , unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God .
58:3:013:0	But encourage one another day after day , as long as it is still called “ Today , ” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
58:3:014:0	For we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end ,
58:3:015:0	while it is said , “ Today if you hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts , as when they provoked Me . ”
58:3:016:0	For who provoked Him when they had heard ? Indeed , did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses ?
58:3:017:0	And with whom was He angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58:3:018:0	And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest , but to those who were disobedient ?
58:3:019:0	So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief .
