58:1:001:1	God’s Final Word in His Son
58:1:001:0	God , after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways ,
58:1:002:0	in these last days has spoken to us in His Son , whom He appointed heir of all things , through whom also He made the world .
58:1:003:0	And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature , and upholds all things by the word of His power . When He had made purification of sins , He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
58:1:004:0	having become as much better than the angels , as He has inherited a more excellent name than they .
58:1:005:0	For to which of the angels did He ever say , “ You are My Son , Today I have begotten You ” ? And again , “ I will be a Father to HimAnd He shall be a Son to Me ” ?
58:1:006:0	And when He again brings the firstborn into the world , He says , “ And let all the angels of God worship Him . ”
58:1:007:0	And of the angels He says , “ Who makes His angels winds , And His ministers a flame of fire . ”
58:1:008:0	But of the Son He says , “ Your throne , O God , is forever and ever , And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom .
58:1:009:0	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness ; Therefore God , Your God , has anointed YouWith the oil of gladness above Your companions . ”
58:1:010:0	And , “ You , Lord , in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth , And the heavens are the works of Your hands ;
58:1:011:0	They will perish , but You remain ; And they all will become old like a garment ,
58:1:012:0	And like a mantle You will roll them up ; Like a garment they will also be changed . But You are the same , And Your years will not come to an end . ”
58:1:013:0	But to which of the angels has He ever said , “ Sit at My right hand , Until I make Your enemiesA footstool for Your feet ” ?
58:1:014:0	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation ?
