58:10:001:1	One Sacrifice of Christ Is Sufficient
58:10:001:0	For the Law , since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things , can never , by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year , make perfect those who draw near .
58:10:002:0	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered , because the worshipers , having once been cleansed , would no longer have had consciousness of sins ?
58:10:003:0	But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year .
58:10:004:0	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58:10:005:0	Therefore , when He comes into the world , He says , “ Sacrifice and offering You have not desired , But a body You have prepared for Me ;
58:10:006:0	In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have taken no pleasure .
58:10:007:0	Then I said , ‘Behold , I have come ( In the scroll of the book it is written of Me ) To do Your will , O God . ’ ”
58:10:008:0	After saying above , “ Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have not desired , nor have You taken pleasure in them ” ( which are offered according to the Law ) ,
58:10:009:0	then He said , “ Behold , I have come to do Your will . ” He takes away the first in order to establish the second .
58:10:010:0	By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58:10:011:0	Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins ;
58:10:012:0	but He , having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time , sat down at the right hand of God ,
58:10:013:0	waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet .
58:10:014:0	For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified .
58:10:015:0	And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us ; for after saying ,
58:10:016:0	“ This is the covenant that I will make with themAfter those days , says the Lord : I will put My laws upon their heart , And on their mind I will write them , ” He then says ,
58:10:017:0	“ And their sins and their lawless deedsI will remember no more . ”
58:10:002:1	A New and Living Way
58:10:018:0	Now where there is forgiveness of these things , there is no longer any offering for sin .
58:10:019:0	Therefore , brethren , since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus ,
58:10:020:0	by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil , that is , His flesh ,
58:10:021:0	and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,
58:10:022:0	let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
58:10:023:0	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for He who promised is faithful ;
58:10:024:0	and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds ,
58:10:003:1	Christ or Judgment
58:10:025:0	not forsaking our own assembling together , as is the habit of some , but encouraging one another ; and all the more as you see the day drawing near .
58:10:026:0	For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
58:10:027:0	but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries .
58:10:028:0	Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58:10:029:0	How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God , and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
58:10:030:0	For we know Him who said , “ Vengeance is Mine , I will repay . ” And again , “ The Lord will judge His people . ”
58:10:031:0	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58:10:032:0	But remember the former days , when , after being enlightened , you endured a great conflict of sufferings ,
58:10:033:0	partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations , and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated .
58:10:034:0	For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one .
58:10:035:0	Therefore , do not throw away your confidence , which has a great reward .
58:10:036:0	For you have need of endurance , so that when you have done the will of God , you may receive what was promised .
58:10:037:0	For yet in a very little while , He who is coming will come , and will not delay .
58:10:038:0	But My righteous one shall live by faith ; And if he shrinks back , My soul has no pleasure in him .
58:10:039:0	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul .
