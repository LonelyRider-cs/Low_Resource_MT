51:2:001:1	You Are Built Up in Christ
51:2:001:0	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea , and for all those who have not personally seen my face ,
51:2:002:0	that their hearts may be encouraged , having been knit together in love , and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding , resulting in a true knowledge of God’s mystery , that is , Christ Himself ,
51:2:003:0	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51:2:004:0	I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument .
51:2:005:0	For even though I am absent in body , nevertheless I am with you in spirit , rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ .
51:2:006:0	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk in Him ,
51:2:007:0	having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith , just as you were instructed , and overflowing with gratitude .
51:2:008:0	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception , according to the tradition of men , according to the elementary principles of the world , rather than according to Christ .
51:2:009:0	For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form ,
51:2:010:0	and in Him you have been made complete , and He is the head over all rule and authority ;
51:2:011:0	and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands , in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ ;
51:2:012:0	having been buried with Him in baptism , in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God , who raised Him from the dead .
51:2:013:0	When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He made you alive together with Him , having forgiven us all our transgressions ,
51:2:014:0	having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us , which was hostile to us ; and He has taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the cross .
51:2:015:0	When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities , He made a public display of them , having triumphed over them through Him .
51:2:016:0	Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day—
51:2:017:0	things which are a mere shadow of what is to come ; but the substance belongs to Christ .
51:2:018:0	Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels , taking his stand on visions he has seen , inflated without cause by his fleshly mind ,
51:2:019:0	and not holding fast to the head , from whom the entire body , being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments , grows with a growth which is from God .
51:2:020:0	If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world , why , as if you were living in the world , do you submit yourself to decrees , such as ,
51:2:021:0	“ Do not handle , do not taste , do not touch ! ”
51:2:022:0	( which all refer to things destined to perish with use ) —in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men ?
51:2:023:0	These are matters which have , to be sure , the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body , but are of no value against fleshly indulgence .
