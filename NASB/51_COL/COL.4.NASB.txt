51:4:001:1	Fellow Workers
51:4:001:0	Masters , grant to your slaves justice and fairness , knowing that you too have a Master in heaven .
51:4:002:0	Devote yourselves to prayer , keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving ;
51:4:003:0	praying at the same time for us as well , that God will open up to us a door for the word , so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ , for which I have also been imprisoned ;
51:4:004:0	that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak .
51:4:005:0	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders , making the most of the opportunity .
51:4:006:0	Let your speech always be with grace , as though seasoned with salt , so that you will know how you should respond to each person .
51:4:007:0	As to all my affairs , Tychicus , our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord , will bring you information .
51:4:008:0	For I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts ;
51:4:009:0	and with him Onesimus , our faithful and beloved brother , who is one of your number . They will inform you about the whole situation here .
51:4:010:0	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , sends you his greetings ; and also Barnabas’s cousin Mark ( about whom you received instructions ; if he comes to you , welcome him ) ;
51:4:011:0	and also Jesus who is called Justus ; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision , and they have proved to be an encouragement to me .
51:4:012:0	Epaphras , who is one of your number , a bondslave of Jesus Christ , sends you his greetings , always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God .
51:4:013:0	For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51:4:014:0	Luke , the beloved physician , sends you his greetings , and also Demas .
51:4:015:0	Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house .
51:4:016:0	When this letter is read among you , have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans ; and you , for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea .
51:4:017:0	Say to Archippus , “ Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you may fulfill it . ”
51:4:018:0	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . Remember my imprisonment . Grace be with you .
