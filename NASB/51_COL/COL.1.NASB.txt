51:1:001:1	Thankfulness for Spiritual Attainments
51:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51:1:002:0	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
51:1:003:0	We give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
51:1:004:0	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints ;
51:1:005:0	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven , of which you previously heard in the word of truth , the gospel
51:1:006:0	which has come to you , just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing , even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth ;
51:1:007:0	just as you learned it from Epaphras , our beloved fellow bond-servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf ,
51:1:008:0	and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit .
51:1:009:0	For this reason also , since the day we heard of it , we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
51:1:010:0	so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord , to please Him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
51:1:011:0	strengthened with all power , according to His glorious might , for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience ; joyously
51:1:002:1	The Incomparable Christ
51:1:012:0	giving thanks to the Father , who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light .
51:1:013:0	For He rescued us from the domain of darkness , and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son ,
51:1:014:0	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
51:1:015:0	He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation .
51:1:016:0	For by Him all things were created , both in the heavens and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him .
51:1:017:0	He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together .
51:1:018:0	He is also head of the body , the church ; and He is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything .
51:1:019:0	For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him ,
51:1:020:0	and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself , having made peace through the blood of His cross ; through Him , I say , whether things on earth or things in heaven .
51:1:021:0	And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind , engaged in evil deeds ,
51:1:022:0	yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death , in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach—
51:1:023:0	if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast , and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard , which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven , and of which I , Paul , was made a minister .
51:1:024:0	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body , which is the church , in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions .
51:1:025:0	Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit , so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God ,
51:1:026:0	that is , the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations , but has now been manifested to His saints ,
51:1:027:0	to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
51:1:028:0	We proclaim Him , admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom , so that we may present every man complete in Christ .
51:1:029:0	For this purpose also I labor , striving according to His power , which mightily works within me .
