51:3:001:1	Put On the New Self
51:3:001:0	Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ , keep seeking the things above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
51:3:002:0	Set your mind on the things above , not on the things that are on earth .
51:3:003:0	For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51:3:004:0	When Christ , who is our life , is revealed , then you also will be revealed with Him in glory .
51:3:005:0	Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality , impurity , passion , evil desire , and greed , which amounts to idolatry .
51:3:006:0	For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience ,
51:3:007:0	and in them you also once walked , when you were living in them .
51:3:008:0	But now you also , put them all aside : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and abusive speech from your mouth .
51:3:009:0	Do not lie to one another , since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices ,
51:3:010:0	and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created himâ€”
51:3:011:0	a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave and freeman , but Christ is all , and in all .
51:3:012:0	So , as those who have been chosen of God , holy and beloved , put on a heart of compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness and patience ;
51:3:013:0	bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , whoever has a complaint against anyone ; just as the Lord forgave you , so also should you .
51:3:014:0	Beyond all these things put on love , which is the perfect bond of unity .
51:3:015:0	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts , to which indeed you were called in one body ; and be thankful .
51:3:016:0	Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you , with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
51:3:002:1	Family Relations
51:3:017:0	Whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks through Him to God the Father .
51:3:018:0	Wives , be subject to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51:3:019:0	Husbands , love your wives and do not be embittered against them .
51:3:020:0	Children , be obedient to your parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing to the Lord .
51:3:021:0	Fathers , do not exasperate your children , so that they will not lose heart .
51:3:022:0	Slaves , in all things obey those who are your masters on earth , not with external service , as those who merely please men , but with sincerity of heart , fearing the Lord .
51:3:023:0	Whatever you do , do your work heartily , as for the Lord rather than for men ,
51:3:024:0	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance . It is the Lord Christ whom you serve .
51:3:025:0	For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done , and that without partiality .
