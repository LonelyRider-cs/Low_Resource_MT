41:2:001:1	The Paralytic Healed
41:2:001:0	When He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward , it was heard that He was at home .
41:2:002:0	And many were gathered together , so that there was no longer room , not even near the door ; and He was speaking the word to them .
41:2:003:0	And they *came , bringing to Him a paralytic , carried by four men .
41:2:004:0	Being unable to get to Him because of the crowd , they removed the roof above Him ; and when they had dug an opening , they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying .
41:2:005:0	And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic , “ Son , your sins are forgiven . ”
41:2:006:0	But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts ,
41:2:007:0	“ Why does this man speak that way ? He is blaspheming ; who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
41:2:008:0	Immediately Jesus , aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves , *said to them , “ Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts ?
41:2:009:0	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘Your sins are forgiven’ ; or to say , ‘Get up , and pick up your pallet and walk’ ?
41:2:010:0	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —He *said to the paralytic ,
41:2:011:0	“ I say to you , get up , pick up your pallet and go home . ”
41:2:012:0	And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone , so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God , saying , “ We have never seen anything like this . ”
41:2:002:1	Levi ( Matthew ) Called
41:2:013:0	And He went out again by the seashore ; and all the people were coming to Him , and He was teaching them .
41:2:014:0	As He passed by , He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax booth , and He *said to him , “ Follow Me ! ” And he got up and followed Him .
41:2:015:0	And it *happened that He was reclining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples ; for there were many of them , and they were following Him .
41:2:016:0	When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , they said to His disciples , “ Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41:2:017:0	And hearing this , Jesus *said to them , “ not those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick ; I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners . ”
41:2:018:0	John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting ; and they *came and *said to Him , “ Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
41:2:019:0	And Jesus said to them , “ While the bridegroom is with them , the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast , can they ? So long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41:2:020:0	But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast in that day .
41:2:021:0	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; otherwise the patch pulls away from it , the new from the old , and a worse tear results .
41:2:003:1	Question of the Sabbath
41:2:022:0	No one puts new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the wine will burst the skins , and the wine is lost and the skins but new wine into fresh wineskins . ”
41:2:023:0	And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath , and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain .
41:2:024:0	The Pharisees were saying to Him , “ Look , why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? ”
41:2:025:0	And He *said to them , “ Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry ;
41:2:026:0	how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar high priest , and ate the consecrated bread , which is not lawful for to eat except the priests , and he also gave it to those who were with him ? ”
41:2:027:0	Jesus said to them , “ The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath .
41:2:028:0	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath . ”
