41:8:001:1	Four Thousand Fed
41:8:001:0	In those days , when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called His disciples and *said to them ,
41:8:002:0	“ I feel compassion for the people because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat .
41:8:003:0	If I send them away hungry to their homes , they will faint on the way ; and some of them have come from a great distance . ”
41:8:004:0	And His disciples answered Him , “ Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people ? ”
41:8:005:0	And He was asking them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven . ”
41:8:006:0	And He *directed the people to sit down on the ground ; and taking the seven loaves , He gave thanks and broke them , and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them , and they served them to the people .
41:8:007:0	They also had a few small fish ; and after He had blessed them , He ordered these to be served as well .
41:8:008:0	And they ate and were satisfied ; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces .
41:8:009:0	About four thousand were there ; and He sent them away .
41:8:010:0	And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha .
41:8:011:0	The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him , seeking from Him a sign from heaven , to test Him .
41:8:012:0	Sighing deeply in His spirit , He *said , “ Why does this generation seek for a sign ? Truly I say to you , no sign will be given to this generation . ”
41:8:013:0	Leaving them , He again embarked and went away to the other side .
41:8:014:0	And they had forgotten to take bread , and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them .
41:8:015:0	And He was giving orders to them , saying , “ Watch out ! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod . ”
41:8:016:0	They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread .
41:8:017:0	And Jesus , aware of this , *said to them , “ Why do you discuss that you have no bread ? Do you not yet see or understand ? Do you have a hardened heart ?
41:8:018:0	H , ? A , ? And do you not remember ,
41:8:019:0	when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up ? ” They *said to Him , “ Twelve . ”
41:8:020:0	“ When the seven for the four thousand , how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up ? ” And they *said to Him , “ Seven . ”
41:8:021:0	And He was saying to them , “ Do you not yet understand ? ”
41:8:022:0	And they *came to Bethsaida . And they *brought a blind man to Jesus and *implored Him to touch him .
41:8:023:0	Taking the blind man by the hand , He brought him out of the village ; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him , He asked him , “ Do you see anything ? ”
41:8:024:0	And he looked up and said , “ I see men , for I see them like trees , walking around . ”
41:8:025:0	Then again He laid His hands on his eyes ; and he looked intently and was restored , and began to see everything clearly .
41:8:002:1	Peter’s Confession of Christ
41:8:026:0	And He sent him to his home , saying , “ Do not even enter the village . ”
41:8:027:0	Jesus went out , along with His disciples , to the villages of Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way He questioned His disciples , saying to them , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
41:8:028:0	They told Him , saying , “ John the Baptist ; and others say Elijah ; but others , one of the prophets . ”
41:8:029:0	And He continued by questioning them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter *answered and *said to Him , “ You are the Christ . ”
41:8:030:0	And He warned them to tell no one about Him .
41:8:031:0	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41:8:032:0	And He was stating the matter plainly . And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him .
41:8:033:0	But turning around and seeing His disciples , He rebuked Peter and *said , “ Get behind Me , Satan ; for you are not setting your mind on God’s interests , but man’s . ”
41:8:034:0	And He summoned the crowd with His disciples , and said to them , “ If anyone wishes to come after Me , he must deny himself , and take up his cross and follow Me .
41:8:035:0	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it .
41:8:036:0	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world , and forfeit his soul ?
41:8:037:0	For what will a man give in exchange for his soul ?
41:8:038:0	For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels . ”
