41:13:001:1	Things to Come
41:13:001:0	As He was going out of the temple , one of His disciples *said to Him , “ Teacher , behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings ! ”
41:13:002:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Do you see these great buildings ? Not one stone will be left upon another which will not be torn down . ”
41:13:003:0	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately ,
41:13:004:0	“ Tell us , when will these things be , and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled ? ”
41:13:005:0	And Jesus began to say to them , “ See to it that no one misleads you .
41:13:006:0	Many will come in My name , saying , ‘I am and will mislead many .
41:13:007:0	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be frightened ; must take place ; but not yet the end .
41:13:008:0	For nation will rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; there will be earthquakes in various places ; there will be famines . These things are the beginning of birth pangs .
41:13:009:0	“ But be on your guard ; for they will deliver you to courts , and you will be flogged in synagogues , and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake , as a testimony to them .
41:13:010:0	The gospel must first be preached to all the nations .
41:13:011:0	When they arrest you and hand you over , do not worry beforehand about what you are to say , but say whatever is given you in that hour ; for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
41:13:012:0	Brother will betray brother to death , and a father child ; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death .
41:13:013:0	You will be hated by all because of My name , but the one who endures to the end , he will be saved .
41:13:014:0	“ But when you see the standing where it should not be ( let the reader understand ) , then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains .
41:13:015:0	The one who is on the housetop must not go down , or go in to get anything out of his house ;
41:13:016:0	and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat .
41:13:017:0	But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
41:13:018:0	But pray that it may not happen in the winter .
41:13:019:0	For those days will be a tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will .
41:13:020:0	Unless the Lord had shortened days , no life would have been saved ; but for the sake of the elect , whom He chose , He shortened the days .
41:13:021:0	And then if anyone says to you , ‘Behold , here is the Christ’ ; or , ‘Behold , there’ ; do not believe
41:13:022:0	for false Christs and false prophets will arise , and will show signs and wonders , in order to lead astray , if possible , the elect .
41:13:002:1	The Return of Christ
41:13:023:0	But take heed ; behold , I have told you everything in advance .
41:13:024:0	“ But in those days , after that tribulation , ,
41:13:025:0	from heaven , and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken .
41:13:026:0	Then they will see S M with great power and glory .
41:13:027:0	And then He will send forth the angels , and will gather together His elect from the four winds , from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven .
41:13:028:0	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree : when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves , you know that summer is near .
41:13:029:0	Even so , you too , when you see these things happening , recognize that He is near , at the door .
41:13:030:0	Truly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
41:13:031:0	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
41:13:032:0	But of that day or hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but the Father
41:13:033:0	“ Take heed , keep on the alert ; for you do not know when the time will come .
41:13:034:0	like a man away on a journey , upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge , to each one his task , also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert .
41:13:035:0	Therefore , be on the alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming , whether in the evening , at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning—
41:13:036:0	in case he should come suddenly and find you asleep .
41:13:037:0	What I say to you I say to all , ‘Be on the alert ! ’ ”
