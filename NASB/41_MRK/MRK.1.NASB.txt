41:1:001:1	Preaching of John the Baptist
41:1:001:0	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41:1:002:0	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet : “ Behold , I send My messenger ahead of You , Who will prepare Your way ;
41:1:003:0	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘Make ready the way of the Lord , Make His paths straight . ’ ”
41:1:004:0	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
41:1:005:0	And all the country of Judea was going out to him , and all the people of Jerusalem ; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River , confessing their sins .
41:1:006:0	John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist , and his diet was locusts and wild honey .
41:1:007:0	And he was preaching , and saying , “ After me One is coming who is mightier than I , and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals .
41:1:002:1	The Baptism of Jesus
41:1:008:0	I baptized you with water ; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ”
41:1:009:0	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41:1:010:0	Immediately coming up out of the water , He saw the heavens opening , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him ;
41:1:011:0	and a voice came out of the heavens : “ You are My beloved Son , in You I am well-pleased . ”
41:1:012:0	Immediately the Spirit *impelled Him to go out into the wilderness .
41:1:003:1	Jesus Preaches in Galilee
41:1:013:0	And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan ; and He was with the wild beasts , and the angels were ministering to Him .
41:1:014:0	Now after John had been taken into custody , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of God ,
41:1:015:0	and saying , “ The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent and believe in the gospel . ”
41:1:016:0	As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon and Andrew , the brother of Simon , casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishermen .
41:1:017:0	And Jesus said to them , “ Follow Me , and I will make you become fishers of men . ”
41:1:018:0	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
41:1:019:0	Going on a little farther , He saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who were also in the boat mending the nets .
41:1:020:0	Immediately He called them ; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went away to follow Him .
41:1:021:0	They *went into Capernaum ; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach .
41:1:022:0	They were amazed at His teaching ; for He was teaching them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
41:1:023:0	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
41:1:024:0	saying , “ What business do we have with each other , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are—the Holy One of God ! ”
41:1:025:0	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be quiet , and come out of him ! ”
41:1:026:0	Throwing him into convulsions , the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him .
41:1:027:0	They were all amazed , so that they debated among themselves , saying , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey Him . ”
41:1:004:1	Crowds Healed
41:1:028:0	Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee .
41:1:029:0	And immediately after they came out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41:1:030:0	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever ; and immediately they *spoke to Jesus about her .
41:1:031:0	And He came to her and raised her up , taking her by the hand , and the fever left her , and she waited on them .
41:1:032:0	When evening came , after the sun had set , they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed .
41:1:033:0	And the whole city had gathered at the door .
41:1:034:0	And He healed many who were ill with various diseases , and cast out many demons ; and He was not permitting the demons to speak , because they knew who He was .
41:1:035:0	In the early morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house , and went away to a secluded place , and was praying there .
41:1:036:0	Simon and his companions searched for Him ;
41:1:037:0	they found Him , and *said to Him , “ Everyone is looking for You . ”
41:1:038:0	He *said to them , “ Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby , so that I may preach there also ; for that is what I came for . ”
41:1:039:0	And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , preaching and casting out the demons .
41:1:040:0	And a leper *came to Jesus , beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him , and saying , “ If You are willing , You can make me clean . ”
41:1:041:0	Moved with compassion , Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him , and *said to him , “ I am willing ; be cleansed . ”
41:1:042:0	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed .
41:1:043:0	And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away ,
41:1:044:0	and He *said to him , “ See that you say nothing to anyone ; but go , show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
41:1:045:0	But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around , to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city , but stayed out in unpopulated areas ; and they were coming to Him from everywhere .
