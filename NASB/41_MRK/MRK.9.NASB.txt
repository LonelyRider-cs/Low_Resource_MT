41:9:001:1	The Transfiguration
41:9:001:0	And Jesus was saying to them , “ Truly I say to you , there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power . ”
41:9:002:0	Six days later , Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John , and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves . And He was transfigured before them ;
41:9:003:0	and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white , as no launderer on earth can whiten them .
41:9:004:0	Elijah appeared to them along with Moses ; and they were talking with Jesus .
41:9:005:0	Peter *said to Jesus , “ Rabbi , it is good for us to be here ; let us make three tabernacles , one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41:9:006:0	For he did not know what to answer ; for they became terrified .
41:9:007:0	Then a cloud formed , overshadowing them , and a voice came out of the cloud , “ This is My beloved Son , listen to Him ! ”
41:9:008:0	All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore , except Jesus alone .
41:9:009:0	As they were coming down from the mountain , He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen , until the Son of Man rose from the dead .
41:9:010:0	They seized upon that statement , discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant .
41:9:011:0	They asked Him , saying , “ Why is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
41:9:012:0	And He said to them , “ Elijah does first come and restore all things . And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt ?
41:9:002:1	All Things Possible
41:9:013:0	But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come , and they did to him whatever they wished , just as it is written of him . ”
41:9:014:0	When they came back to the disciples , they saw a large crowd around them , and some scribes arguing with them .
41:9:015:0	Immediately , when the entire crowd saw Him , they were amazed and began running up to greet Him .
41:9:016:0	And He asked them , “ What are you discussing with them ? ”
41:9:017:0	And one of the crowd answered Him , “ Teacher , I brought You my son , possessed with a spirit which makes him mute ;
41:9:018:0	and whenever it seizes him , it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth , and grinds his teeth and stiffens out . I told Your disciples to cast it out , and they could not do it . ”
41:9:019:0	And He *answered them and *said , “ O unbelieving generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him to Me ! ”
41:9:020:0	They brought the boy to Him . When he saw Him , immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion , and falling to the ground , he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth .
41:9:021:0	And He asked his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” And he said , “ From childhood .
41:9:022:0	It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him . But if You can do anything , take pity on us and help us ! ”
41:9:023:0	And Jesus said to him , “ ‘If You can ? ’ All things are possible to him who believes . ”
41:9:024:0	Immediately the boy’s father cried out and said , “ I do believe ; help my unbelief . ”
41:9:025:0	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering , He rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ You deaf and mute spirit , I command you , come out of him and do not enter him again . ”
41:9:026:0	After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions , it came out ; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said , “ He is dead ! ”
41:9:027:0	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him ; and he got up .
41:9:028:0	When He came into the house , His disciples began questioning Him privately , “ Why could we not drive it out ? ”
41:9:003:1	Death and Resurrection Foretold
41:9:029:0	And He said to them , “ This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer . ”
41:9:030:0	From there they went out and began to go through Galilee , and He did not want anyone to know about it .
41:9:031:0	For He was teaching His disciples and telling them , “ The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men , and they will kill Him ; and when He has been killed , He will rise three days later . ”
41:9:032:0	But they did not understand this statement , and they were afraid to ask Him .
41:9:033:0	They came to Capernaum ; and when He was in the house , He began to question them , “ What were you discussing on the way ? ”
41:9:034:0	But they kept silent , for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest .
41:9:035:0	Sitting down , He called the twelve and *said to them , “ If anyone wants to be first , he shall be last of all and servant of all . ”
41:9:036:0	Taking a child , He set him before them , and taking him in His arms , He said to them ,
41:9:004:1	Dire Warnings
41:9:037:0	“ Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me ; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me , but Him who sent Me . ”
41:9:038:0	John said to Him , “ Teacher , we saw someone casting out demons in Your name , and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us . ”
41:9:039:0	But Jesus said , “ Do not hinder him , for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name , and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me .
41:9:040:0	For he who is not against us is for us .
41:9:041:0	For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as of Christ , truly I say to you , he will not lose his reward .
41:9:042:0	“ Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble , it would be better for him if , with a heavy millstone hung around his neck , he had been cast into the sea .
41:9:043:0	If your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off ; it is better for you to enter life crippled , than , having your two hands , to go into hell , into the unquenchable fire ,
41:9:044:0	[ where , . ]
41:9:045:0	If your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off ; it is better for you to enter life lame , than , having your two feet , to be cast into hell ,
41:9:046:0	[ where , . ]
41:9:047:0	If your eye causes you to stumble , throw it out ; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye , than , having two eyes , to be cast into hell ,
41:9:048:0	where , .
41:9:049:0	“ For everyone will be salted with fire .
41:9:050:0	Salt is good ; but if the salt becomes unsalty , with what will you make it salty Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . ”
