41:16:001:1	The Resurrection
41:16:001:0	When the Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , bought spices , so that they might come and anoint Him .
41:16:002:0	Very early on the first day of the week , they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen .
41:16:003:0	They were saying to one another , “ Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb ? ”
41:16:004:0	Looking up , they *saw that the stone had been rolled away , although it was extremely large .
41:16:005:0	Entering the tomb , they saw a young man sitting at the right , wearing a white robe ; and they were amazed .
41:16:006:0	And he *said to them , “ Do not be amazed ; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene , who has been crucified . He has risen ; He is not here ; behold , here is the place where they laid Him .
41:16:007:0	But go , tell His disciples and Peter , ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee ; there you will see Him , just as He told you . ’ ”
41:16:008:0	They went out and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had gripped them ; and they said nothing to anyone , for they were afraid .
41:16:009:0	[ Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week , He first appeared to Mary Magdalene , from whom He had cast out seven demons .
41:16:010:0	She went and reported to those who had been with Him , while they were mourning and weeping .
41:16:011:0	When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her , they refused to believe it .
41:16:012:0	After that , He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking along on their way to the country .
41:16:002:1	The Disciples Commissioned
41:16:013:0	They went away and reported it to the others , but they did not believe them either .
41:16:014:0	Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table ; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen .
41:16:015:0	And He said to them , “ Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation .
41:16:016:0	He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved ; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned .
41:16:017:0	These signs will accompany those who have believed : in My name they will cast out demons , they will speak with new tongues ;
41:16:018:0	they will pick up serpents , and if they drink any deadly it will not hurt them ; they will lay hands on the sick , and they will recover . ”
41:16:019:0	So then , when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them , He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God .
41:16:020:0	And they went out and preached everywhere , while the Lord worked with them , and confirmed the word by the signs that followed . ] [ And they promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions . And after that , Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation . ]
