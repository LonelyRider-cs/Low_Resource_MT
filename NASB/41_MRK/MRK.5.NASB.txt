41:5:001:1	The Gerasene Demoniac
41:5:001:0	They came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gerasenes .
41:5:002:0	When He got out of the boat , immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him ,
41:5:003:0	and he had his dwelling among the tombs . And no one was able to bind him anymore , even with a chain ;
41:5:004:0	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces , and no one was strong enough to subdue him .
41:5:005:0	Constantly , night and day , he was screaming among the tombs and in the mountains , and gashing himself with stones .
41:5:006:0	Seeing Jesus from a distance , he ran up and bowed down before Him ;
41:5:007:0	and shouting with a loud voice , he *said , “ What business do we have with each other , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I implore You by God , do not torment me ! ”
41:5:008:0	For He had been saying to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
41:5:009:0	And He was asking him , “ What is your name ? ” And he *said to Him , “ My name is Legion ; for we are many . ”
41:5:010:0	And he began to implore Him earnestly not to send them out of the country .
41:5:011:0	Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain .
41:5:012:0	The demons implored Him , saying , “ Send us into the swine so that we may enter them . ”
41:5:013:0	Jesus gave them permission . And coming out , the unclean spirits entered the swine ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea , about two thousand of them ; and they were drowned in the sea .
41:5:014:0	Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the country . And the people came to see what it was that had happened .
41:5:015:0	They *came to Jesus and *observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down , clothed and in his right mind , the very man who had had the “ legion ” ; and they became frightened .
41:5:016:0	Those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man , and all about the swine .
41:5:017:0	And they began to implore Him to leave their region .
41:5:018:0	As He was getting into the boat , the man who had been demon-possessed was imploring Him that he might accompany Him .
41:5:019:0	And He did not let him , but He *said to him , “ Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you , and He had mercy on you . ”
41:5:002:1	Miracles and Healing
41:5:020:0	And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him ; and everyone was amazed .
41:5:021:0	When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side , a large crowd gathered around Him ; and so He stayed by the seashore .
41:5:022:0	One of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up , and on seeing Him , *fell at His feet
41:5:023:0	and *implored Him earnestly , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death ; please come and lay Your hands on her , so that she will get well and live . ”
41:5:024:0	And He went off with him ; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him .
41:5:025:0	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years ,
41:5:026:0	and had endured much at the hands of many physicians , and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all , but rather had grown worse—
41:5:027:0	after hearing about Jesus , she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak .
41:5:028:0	For she thought , “ If I just touch His garments , I will get well . ”
41:5:029:0	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
41:5:030:0	Immediately Jesus , perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth , turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched My garments ? ”
41:5:031:0	And His disciples said to Him , “ You see the crowd pressing in on You , and You say , ‘Who touched Me ? ’ ”
41:5:032:0	And He looked around to see the woman who had done this .
41:5:033:0	But the woman fearing and trembling , aware of what had happened to her , came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
41:5:034:0	And He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace and be healed of your affliction . ”
41:5:035:0	While He was still speaking , they *came from the house of the synagogue official , saying , “ Your daughter has died ; why trouble the Teacher anymore ? ”
41:5:036:0	But Jesus , overhearing what was being spoken , *said to the synagogue official , “ Do not be afraid only believe . ”
41:5:037:0	And He allowed no one to accompany Him , except Peter and James and John the brother of James .
41:5:038:0	They *came to the house of the synagogue official ; and He *saw a commotion , and people loudly weeping and wailing .
41:5:039:0	And entering in , He *said to them , “ Why make a commotion and weep ? The child has not died , but is asleep . ”
41:5:040:0	They began laughing at Him . But putting them all out , He *took along the child’s father and mother and His own companions , and *entered the room where the child was .
41:5:041:0	Taking the child by the hand , He *said to her , “ Talitha kum ! ” ( which translated means , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up ! ” ) .
41:5:042:0	Immediately the girl got up and began to walk , for she was twelve years old . And immediately they were completely astounded .
41:5:043:0	And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this , and He said that something should be given her to eat .
