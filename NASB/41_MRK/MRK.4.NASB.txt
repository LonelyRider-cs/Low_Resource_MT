41:4:001:1	Parable of the Sower and Soils
41:4:001:0	He began to teach again by the sea . And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down ; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land .
41:4:002:0	And He was teaching them many things in parables , and was saying to them in His teaching ,
41:4:003:0	“ Listen Behold , the sower went out to sow ;
41:4:004:0	as he was sowing , some fell beside the road , and the birds came and ate it up .
41:4:005:0	Other fell on the rocky where it did not have much soil ; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil .
41:4:006:0	And after the sun had risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
41:4:007:0	Other fell among the thorns , and the thorns came up and choked it , and it yielded no crop .
41:4:008:0	Other fell into the good soil , and as they grew up and increased , they yielded a crop and produced thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold . ”
41:4:009:0	And He was saying , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41:4:010:0	As soon as He was alone , His followers , along with the twelve , began asking Him about the parables .
41:4:011:0	And He was saying to them , “ To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God , but those who are outside get everything in parables ,
41:4:002:1	Explanation
41:4:012:0	so that , , , , . ”
41:4:013:0	And He *said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How will you understand all the parables ?
41:4:014:0	The sower sows the word .
41:4:015:0	These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown ; and when they hear , immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
41:4:016:0	In a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy ;
41:4:017:0	and they have no root in themselves , but are temporary ; then , when affliction or persecution arises because of the word , immediately they fall away .
41:4:018:0	And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns ; these are the ones who have heard the word ,
41:4:019:0	but the worries of the world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
41:4:020:0	And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil ; and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit , thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold . ”
41:4:021:0	And He was saying to them , “ A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket , is it , or under a bed ? Is it not to be put on the lampstand ?
41:4:022:0	For nothing is hidden , except to be revealed ; nor has been secret , but that it would come to light .
41:4:023:0	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41:4:024:0	And He was saying to them , “ Take care what you listen to . By your standard of measure it will be measured to you ; and more will be given you besides .
41:4:003:1	Parable of the Seed
41:4:025:0	For whoever has , to him shall be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he has shall be taken away from him . ”
41:4:026:0	And He was saying , “ The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil ;
41:4:027:0	and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day , and the seed sprouts and grows—how , he himself does not know .
41:4:028:0	The soil produces crops by itself ; first the blade , then the head , then the mature grain in the head .
41:4:004:1	Parable of the Mustard Seed
41:4:029:0	But when the crop permits , he immediately puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come . ”
41:4:030:0	And He said , “ How shall we picture the kingdom of God , or by what parable shall we present it ?
41:4:031:0	like a mustard seed , which , when sown upon the soil , though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil ,
41:4:032:0	yet when it is sown , it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches ; so that can . ”
41:4:033:0	With many such parables He was speaking the word to them , so far as they were able to hear it ;
41:4:005:1	Jesus Stills the Sea
41:4:034:0	and He did not speak to them without a parable ; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples .
41:4:035:0	On that day , when evening came , He *said to them , “ Let us go over to the other side . ”
41:4:036:0	Leaving the crowd , they *took Him along with them in the boat , just as He was ; and other boats were with Him .
41:4:037:0	And there *arose a fierce gale of wind , and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up .
41:4:038:0	Jesus Himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion ; and they *woke Him and *said to Him , “ Teacher , do You not care that we are perishing ? ”
41:4:039:0	And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea , “ Hush , be still . ” And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm .
41:4:040:0	And He said to them , “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? ”
41:4:041:0	They became very much afraid and said to one another , “ Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey Him ? ”
