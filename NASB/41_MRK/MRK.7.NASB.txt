41:7:001:1	Followers of Tradition
41:7:001:0	The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem ,
41:7:002:0	and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands , that is , unwashed .
41:7:003:0	( For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands , thus observing the traditions of the elders ;
41:7:004:0	and when they come from the market place , they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves ; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe , such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots . )
41:7:005:0	The Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him , “ Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with impure hands ? ”
41:7:006:0	And He said to them , “ Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written : ‘T M , B M .
41:7:007:0	B M , T . ’
41:7:008:0	Neglecting the commandment of God , you hold to the tradition of men . ”
41:7:009:0	He was also saying to them , “ You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition .
41:7:010:0	For Moses said , ‘H’ ; and , ‘H , ’ ;
41:7:011:0	but you say , ‘If a man says to father or mother , whatever I have that would help you is Corban ( that is to say , given to God ) , ’
41:7:012:0	you no longer permit him to do anything for father or mother ;
41:7:002:1	The Heart of Man
41:7:013:0	invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down ; and you do many things such as that . ”
41:7:014:0	After He called the crowd to Him again , He began saying to them , “ Listen to Me , all of you , and understand :
41:7:015:0	there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man .
41:7:016:0	[ If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . ” ]
41:7:017:0	When he had left the crowd and entered the house , His disciples questioned Him about the parable .
41:7:018:0	And He *said to them , “ Are you so lacking in understanding also ? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him ,
41:7:019:0	because it does not go into his heart , but into his stomach , and is eliminated ? ” ( Thus He declared all foods clean . )
41:7:020:0	And He was saying , “ That which proceeds out of the man , that is what defiles the man .
41:7:021:0	For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed the evil thoughts , fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries ,
41:7:022:0	deeds of coveting wickedness , deceit , sensuality , envy , slander , pride foolishness .
41:7:003:1	The Syrophoenician Woman
41:7:023:0	All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man . ”
41:7:024:0	Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre . And when He had entered a house , He wanted no one to know of it ; yet He could not escape notice .
41:7:025:0	But after hearing of Him , a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet .
41:7:026:0	Now the woman was a Gentile , of the Syrophoenician race . And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41:7:027:0	And He was saying to her , “ Let the children be satisfied first , for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . ”
41:7:028:0	But she answered and *said to Him , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs under the table feed on the children’s crumbs . ”
41:7:029:0	And He said to her , “ Because of this answer go ; the demon has gone out of your daughter . ”
41:7:030:0	And going back to her home , she found the child lying on the bed , the demon having left .
41:7:031:0	Again He went out from the region of Tyre , and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , within the region of Decapolis .
41:7:032:0	They *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty , and they *implored Him to lay His hand on him .
41:7:033:0	Jesus took him aside from the crowd , by himself , and put His fingers into his ears , and after spitting , He touched his tongue with the saliva ;
41:7:034:0	and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh , He *said to him , “ Ephphatha ! ” that is , “ Be opened ! ”
41:7:035:0	And his ears were opened , and the impediment of his tongue was removed , and he began speaking plainly .
41:7:036:0	And He gave them orders not to tell anyone ; but the more He ordered them , the more widely they continued to proclaim it .
41:7:037:0	They were utterly astonished , saying , “ He has done all things well ; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak . ”
