41:11:001:1	The Triumphal Entry
41:11:001:0	As they *approached Jerusalem , at Bethphage and Bethany , near the Mount of Olives , He *sent two of His disciples ,
41:11:002:0	and *said to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and immediately as you enter it , you will find a colt tied on which no one yet has ever sat ; untie it and bring it
41:11:003:0	If anyone says to you , ‘Why are you doing this ? ’ you say , ‘The Lord has need of it’ ; and immediately he will send it back here . ”
41:11:004:0	They went away and found a colt tied at the door , outside in the street ; and they *untied it .
41:11:005:0	Some of the bystanders were saying to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
41:11:006:0	They spoke to them just as Jesus had told them , and they gave them permission .
41:11:007:0	They *brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it ; and He sat on it .
41:11:008:0	And many spread their coats in the road , and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
41:11:009:0	Those who went in front and those who followed were shouting : “ Hosanna ! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord ;
41:11:010:0	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ; Hosanna in the highest ! ”
41:11:011:0	Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple ; and after looking around at everything , He left for Bethany with the twelve , since it was already late .
41:11:012:0	On the next day , when they had left Bethany , He became hungry .
41:11:013:0	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf , He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it ; and when He came to it , He found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41:11:002:1	Jesus Drives Money Changers from the Temple
41:11:014:0	He said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! ” And His disciples were listening .
41:11:015:0	Then they *came to Jerusalem . And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple , and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves ;
41:11:016:0	and He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple .
41:11:017:0	And He began to teach and say to them , “ Is it not written , ‘M’ ? But you have made it a ’ . ”
41:11:018:0	The chief priests and the scribes heard this , and began seeking how to destroy Him ; for they were afraid of Him , for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching .
41:11:019:0	When evening came , they would go out of the city .
41:11:020:0	As they were passing by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up .
41:11:021:0	Being reminded , Peter *said to Him , “ Rabbi , look , the fig tree which You cursed has withered . ”
41:11:022:0	And Jesus *answered saying to them , “ Have faith in God .
41:11:023:0	Truly I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says is going to happen , it will be him .
41:11:024:0	Therefore I say to you , all things for which you pray and ask , believe that you have received them , and they will be you .
41:11:025:0	Whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone , so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions .
41:11:003:1	Jesus’ Authority Questioned
41:11:026:0	[ But if you do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions . ” ]
41:11:027:0	They *came again to Jerusalem . And as He was walking in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders *came to Him ,
41:11:028:0	and began saying to Him , “ By what authority are You doing these things , or who gave You this authority to do these things ? ”
41:11:029:0	And Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question , and you answer Me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41:11:030:0	Was the baptism of John from heaven , or from men ? Answer Me . ”
41:11:031:0	They began reasoning among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘Then why did you not believe him ? ’
41:11:032:0	But shall we say , ‘From men’ ? ” —they were afraid of the people , for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet .
41:11:033:0	Answering Jesus , they *said , “ We do not know . ” And Jesus *said to them , “ Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
