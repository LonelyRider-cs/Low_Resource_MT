41:15:001:1	Jesus before Pilate
41:15:001:0	Early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Council , immediately held a consultation ; and binding Jesus , they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate .
41:15:002:0	Pilate questioned Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” And He *answered him , “ you say . ”
41:15:003:0	The chief priests began to accuse Him harshly .
41:15:004:0	Then Pilate questioned Him again , saying , “ Do You not answer ? See how many charges they bring against You ! ”
41:15:005:0	But Jesus made no further answer ; so Pilate was amazed .
41:15:006:0	Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested .
41:15:007:0	The man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection .
41:15:008:0	The crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them .
41:15:009:0	Pilate answered them , saying , “ Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews ? ”
41:15:010:0	For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy .
41:15:011:0	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead .
41:15:012:0	Answering again , Pilate said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews ? ”
41:15:013:0	They shouted back , “ Crucify Him ! ”
41:15:014:0	But Pilate said to them , “ Why , what evil has He done ? ” But they shouted all the more , “ Crucify Him ! ”
41:15:002:1	Jesus Is Mocked
41:15:015:0	Wishing to satisfy the crowd , Pilate released Barabbas for them , and after having Jesus scourged , he handed Him over to be crucified .
41:15:016:0	The soldiers took Him away into the palace ( that is , the Praetorium ) , and they *called together the whole Roman cohort .
41:15:017:0	They *dressed Him up in purple , and after twisting a crown of thorns , they put it on Him ;
41:15:018:0	and they began to acclaim Him , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
41:15:019:0	They kept beating His head with a reed , and spitting on Him , and kneeling and bowing before Him .
41:15:020:0	After they had mocked Him , they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him . And they *led Him out to crucify Him .
41:15:003:1	The Crucifixion
41:15:021:0	They *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country , Simon of Cyrene ( the father of Alexander and Rufus ) , to bear His cross .
41:15:022:0	Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha , which is translated , Place of a Skull .
41:15:023:0	They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh ; but He did not take it .
41:15:024:0	And they *crucified Him , and *divided up His garments among themselves , casting lots for them to decide what each man should take .
41:15:025:0	It was the third hour when they crucified Him .
41:15:026:0	The inscription of the charge against Him read , “ THE KING OF THE JEWS . ”
41:15:027:0	They *crucified two robbers with Him , one on His right and one on His left .
41:15:028:0	[ And the Scripture was fulfilled which says , “ And He was numbered with transgressors . ” ]
41:15:029:0	Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him , wagging their heads , and saying , “ Ha ! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days ,
41:15:030:0	save Yourself , and come down from the cross ! ”
41:15:031:0	In the same way the chief priests also , along with the scribes , were mocking Him among themselves and saying , “ He saved others ; He cannot save Himself .
41:15:032:0	Let this Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , so that we may see and believe ! ” Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him .
41:15:033:0	When the sixth hour came , darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour .
41:15:034:0	At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , “ E , E , ? ” which is translated , “ M G , M G , Y M ? ”
41:15:035:0	When some of the bystanders heard it , they began saying , “ Behold , He is calling for Elijah . ”
41:15:036:0	Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine , put it on a reed , and gave Him a drink , saying , “ Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down . ”
41:15:037:0	And Jesus uttered a loud cry , and breathed His last .
41:15:038:0	And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
41:15:039:0	When the centurion , who was standing right in front of Him , saw the way He breathed His last , he said , “ Truly this man was the Son of God ! ”
41:15:040:0	There were also some women looking on from a distance , among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses , and Salome .
41:15:004:1	Jesus Is Buried
41:15:041:0	When He was in Galilee , they used to follow Him and minister to Him ; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem .
41:15:042:0	When evening had already come , because it was the preparation day , that is , the day before the Sabbath ,
41:15:043:0	Joseph of Arimathea came , a prominent member of the Council , who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God ; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus .
41:15:044:0	Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time , and summoning the centurion , he questioned him as to whether He was already dead .
41:15:045:0	And ascertaining this from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
41:15:046:0	Joseph bought a linen cloth , took Him down , wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock ; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb .
41:15:047:0	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He was laid .
