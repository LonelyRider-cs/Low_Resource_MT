41:10:001:1	Jesus’ Teaching about Divorce
41:10:001:0	Getting up , He *went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan ; crowds *gathered around Him again , and , according to His custom , He once more began to teach them .
41:10:002:0	Some Pharisees came up to Jesus , testing Him , and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife .
41:10:003:0	And He answered and said to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
41:10:004:0	They said , “ Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away . ”
41:10:005:0	But Jesus said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
41:10:006:0	But from the beginning of creation , .
41:10:007:0	F ,
41:10:008:0	; so they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41:10:009:0	What therefore God has joined together , let no man separate . ”
41:10:010:0	In the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again .
41:10:011:0	And He *said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her ;
41:10:002:1	Jesus Blesses Little Children
41:10:012:0	and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man , she is committing adultery . ”
41:10:013:0	And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them ; but the disciples rebuked them .
41:10:014:0	But when Jesus saw this , He was indignant and said to them , “ Permit the children to come to Me ; do not hinder them ; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
41:10:015:0	Truly I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it ”
41:10:003:1	The Rich Young Ruler
41:10:016:0	And He took them in His arms and began blessing them , laying His hands on them .
41:10:017:0	As He was setting out on a journey , a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him , and asked Him , “ Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
41:10:018:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is good except God alone .
41:10:019:0	You know the commandments , ‘D , D , D , D , Do not defraud , H . ’ ”
41:10:020:0	And he said to Him , “ Teacher , I have kept all these things from my youth up . ”
41:10:021:0	Looking at him , Jesus felt a love for him and said to him , “ One thing you lack : go and sell all you possess and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me . ”
41:10:022:0	But at these words he was saddened , and he went away grieving , for he was one who owned much property .
41:10:023:0	And Jesus , looking around , *said to His disciples , “ How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
41:10:024:0	The disciples were amazed at His words . But Jesus *answered again and *said to them , “ Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41:10:025:0	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
41:10:026:0	They were even more astonished and said to Him , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
41:10:027:0	Looking at them , Jesus *said , “ With people it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . ”
41:10:028:0	Peter began to say to Him , “ Behold , we have left everything and followed You . ”
41:10:029:0	Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you , there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms , for My sake and for the gospel’s sake ,
41:10:030:0	but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms , along with persecutions ; and in the age to come , eternal life .
41:10:004:1	Jesus’ Sufferings Foretold
41:10:031:0	But many first will be last , and the last , first . ”
41:10:032:0	They were on the road going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking on ahead of them ; and they were amazed , and those who followed were fearful . And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him ,
41:10:033:0	saying , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand Him over to the Gentiles .
41:10:034:0	They will mock Him and spit on Him , and scourge Him and kill and three days later He will rise again . ”
41:10:035:0	James and John , the two sons of Zebedee , *came up to Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You . ”
41:10:036:0	And He said to them , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
41:10:037:0	They said to Him , “ Grant that we may sit , one on Your right and one on Your left , in Your glory . ”
41:10:038:0	But Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink , or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
41:10:039:0	They said to Him , “ We are able . ” And Jesus said to them , “ The cup that I drink you shall drink ; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized .
41:10:040:0	But to sit on My right or on left , this is not Mine to give ; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared . ”
41:10:041:0	Hearing this , the ten began to feel indignant with James and John .
41:10:042:0	Calling them to Himself , Jesus *said to them , “ You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and their great men exercise authority over them .
41:10:043:0	But it is not this way among you , but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant ;
41:10:044:0	and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all .
41:10:005:1	Bartimaeus Receives His Sight
41:10:045:0	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life a ransom for many . ”
41:10:046:0	Then they *came to Jericho . And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the road .
41:10:047:0	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41:10:048:0	Many were sternly telling him to be quiet , but he kept crying out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41:10:049:0	And Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him ” So they *called the blind man , saying to him , “ Take courage , stand up ! He is calling for you . ”
41:10:050:0	Throwing aside his cloak , he jumped up and came to Jesus .
41:10:051:0	And answering him , Jesus said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” And the blind man said to Him , “ Rabboni , I want to regain my sight ! ”
41:10:052:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Go ; your faith has made you well . ” Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road .
