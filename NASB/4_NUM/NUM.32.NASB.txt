4:32:001:1	Reuben and Gad Settle in Gilead
4:32:001:0	Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock . So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead , that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock ,
4:32:002:0	the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation , saying ,
4:32:003:0	“ Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo and Beon ,
4:32:004:0	the land which the Lord conquered before the congregation of Israel , is a land for livestock , and your servants have livestock . ”
4:32:005:0	They said , “ If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants as a possession ; do not take us across the Jordan . ”
4:32:006:0	But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben , “ Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here ?
4:32:007:0	Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which the Lord has given them ?
4:32:008:0	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land .
4:32:009:0	For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land , they discouraged the sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
4:32:010:0	So the Lord’s anger burned in that day , and He swore , saying ,
4:32:011:0	‘None of the men who came up from Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land which I swore to Abraham , to Isaac and to Jacob ; for they did not follow Me fully ,
4:32:012:0	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun , for they have followed the Lord fully . ’
4:32:013:0	So the Lord’s anger burned against Israel , and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the Lord was destroyed .
4:32:014:0	Now behold , you have risen up in your fathers’ place , a brood of sinful men , to add still more to the burning anger of the Lord against Israel .
4:32:015:0	For if you turn away from following Him , He will once more abandon them in the wilderness , and you will destroy all these people . ”
4:32:016:0	Then they came near to him and said , “ We will build here sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our little ones ;
4:32:017:0	but we ourselves will be armed ready to go before the sons of Israel , until we have brought them to their place , while our little ones live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
4:32:018:0	We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his inheritance .
4:32:019:0	For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond , because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan toward the east . ”
4:32:020:0	So Moses said to them , “ If you will do this , if you will arm yourselves before the Lord for the war ,
4:32:021:0	and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before the Lord until He has driven His enemies out from before Him ,
4:32:022:0	and the land is subdued before the Lord , then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward the Lord and toward Israel , and this land shall be yours for a possession before the Lord .
4:32:023:0	But if you will not do so , behold , you have sinned against the Lord , and be sure your sin will find you out .
4:32:024:0	Build yourselves cities for your little ones , and sheepfolds for your sheep , and do what you have promised . ”
4:32:025:0	The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying , “ Your servants will do just as my lord commands .
4:32:026:0	Our little ones , our wives , our livestock and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead ;
4:32:027:0	while your servants , everyone who is armed for war , will cross over in the presence of the Lord to battle , just as my lord says . ”
4:32:028:0	So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest , and to Joshua the son of Nun , and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the sons of Israel .
4:32:029:0	Moses said to them , “ If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben , everyone who is armed for battle , will cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of the Lord , and the land is subdued before you , then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession ;
4:32:030:0	but if they will not cross over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan . ”
4:32:031:0	The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered , saying , “ As the Lord has said to your servants , so we will do .
4:32:032:0	We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of the Lord into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us across the Jordan . ”
4:32:033:0	So Moses gave to them , to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh , the kingdom of Sihon , king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og , the king of Bashan , the land with its cities with their territories , the cities of the surrounding land .
4:32:034:0	The sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer ,
4:32:035:0	and Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah ,
4:32:036:0	and Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities , and sheepfolds for sheep .
4:32:037:0	The sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim ,
4:32:038:0	and Nebo and Baal-meon—their names being changed—and Sibmah , and they gave other names to the cities which they built .
4:32:039:0	The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it , and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it .
4:32:040:0	So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh , and he lived in it .
4:32:041:0	Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns , and called them Havvoth-jair .
4:32:042:0	Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages , and called it Nobah after his own name .
