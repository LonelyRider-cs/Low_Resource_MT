4:35:001:1	Cities for the Levites
4:35:001:0	Now the Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho , saying ,
4:35:002:0	“ Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to live in ; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities .
4:35:003:0	The cities shall be theirs to live in ; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their beasts .
4:35:004:0	“ The pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits around .
4:35:002:1	Cities of Refuge
4:35:005:0	You shall also measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits , and on the south side two thousand cubits , and on the west side two thousand cubits , and on the north side two thousand cubits , with the city in the center . This shall become theirs as pasture lands for the cities .
4:35:006:0	The cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to ; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities .
4:35:007:0	All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities , together with their pasture lands .
4:35:008:0	As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel , you shall take more from the larger and you shall take less from the smaller ; each shall give some of his cities to the Levites in proportion to his possession which he inherits . ”
4:35:009:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:35:010:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
4:35:011:0	then you shall select for yourselves cities to be your cities of refuge , that the manslayer who has killed any person unintentionally may flee there .
4:35:012:0	The cities shall be to you as a refuge from the avenger , so that the manslayer will not die until he stands before the congregation for trial .
4:35:013:0	The cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge .
4:35:014:0	You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan ; they are to be cities of refuge .
4:35:015:0	These six cities shall be for refuge for the sons of Israel , and for the alien and for the sojourner among them ; that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there .
4:35:016:0	‘But if he struck him down with an iron object , so that he died , he is a murderer ; the murderer shall surely be put to death .
4:35:017:0	If he struck him down with a stone in the hand , by which he will die , and as a result he died , he is a murderer ; the murderer shall surely be put to death .
4:35:018:0	Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand , by which he might die , and as a result he died , he is a murderer ; the murderer shall surely be put to death .
4:35:019:0	The blood avenger himself shall put the murderer to death ; he shall put him to death when he meets him .
4:35:020:0	If he pushed him of hatred , or threw something at him lying in wait and as a result he died ,
4:35:021:0	or if he struck him down with his hand in enmity , and as a result he died , the one who struck him shall surely be put to death , he is a murderer ; the blood avenger shall put the murderer to death when he meets him .
4:35:022:0	‘But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity , or threw something at him without lying in wait ,
4:35:023:0	or with any deadly object of stone , and without seeing it dropped on him so that he died , while he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury ,
4:35:024:0	then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these ordinances .
4:35:025:0	The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger , and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled ; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil .
4:35:026:0	But if the manslayer at any time goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he may flee ,
4:35:027:0	and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge , and the blood avenger kills the manslayer , he will not be guilty of blood
4:35:028:0	because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest . But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession .
4:35:029:0	‘These things shall be for a statutory ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
4:35:030:0	‘If anyone kills a person , the murderer shall be put to death at the evidence of witnesses , but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness .
4:35:031:0	Moreover , you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death , but he shall surely be put to death .
4:35:032:0	You shall not take ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge , that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest .
4:35:033:0	So you shall not pollute the land in which you are ; for blood pollutes the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it , except by the blood of him who shed it .
4:35:034:0	You shall not defile the land in which you live , in the midst of which I dwell ; for I the Lord am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel . ’ ”
