4:27:001:1	A Law of Inheritance
4:27:001:0	Then the daughters of Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph , came near ; and these are the names of his daughters : Mahlah , Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah .
4:27:002:0	They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation , at the doorway of the tent of meeting , saying ,
4:27:003:0	“ Our father died in the wilderness , yet he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah ; but he died in his own sin , and he had no sons .
4:27:004:0	Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family because he had no son ? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers . ”
4:27:005:0	So Moses brought their case before the Lord .
4:27:006:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:27:007:0	“ The daughters of Zelophehad are right in their statements . You shall surely give them a hereditary possession among their father’s brothers , and you shall transfer the inheritance of their father to them .
4:27:008:0	Further , you shall speak to the sons of Israel , saying , ‘If a man dies and has no son , then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter .
4:27:009:0	If he has no daughter , then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers .
4:27:010:0	If he has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers .
4:27:011:0	If his father has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family , and he shall possess it ; and it shall be a statutory ordinance to the sons of Israel , just as the Lord commanded Moses . ’ ”
4:27:012:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Go up to this mountain of Abarim , and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel .
4:27:013:0	When you have seen it , you too will be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother was ;
4:27:002:1	Joshua to Succeed Moses
4:27:014:0	for in the wilderness of Zin , during the strife of the congregation , you rebelled against My command to treat Me as holy before their eyes at the water . ” ( These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin . )
4:27:015:0	Then Moses spoke to the Lord , saying ,
4:27:016:0	“ May the Lord , the God of the spirits of all flesh , appoint a man over the congregation ,
4:27:017:0	who will go out and come in before them , and who will lead them out and bring them in , so that the congregation of the Lord will not be like sheep which have no shepherd . ”
4:27:018:0	So the Lord said to Moses , “ Take Joshua the son of Nun , a man in whom is the Spirit , and lay your hand on him ;
4:27:019:0	and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation , and commission him in their sight .
4:27:020:0	You shall put some of your authority on him , in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him .
4:27:021:0	Moreover , he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord . At his command they shall go out and at his command they shall come in , both he and the sons of Israel with him , even all the congregation . ”
4:27:022:0	Moses did just as the Lord commanded him ; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation .
4:27:023:0	Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him , just as the Lord had spoken through Moses .
