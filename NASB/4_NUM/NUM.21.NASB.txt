4:21:001:1	Arad Conquered
4:21:001:0	When the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who lived in the Negev , heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim , then he fought against Israel and took some of them captive .
4:21:002:0	So Israel made a vow to the Lord and said , “ If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities . ”
4:21:003:0	The Lord heard the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites ; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities . Thus the name of the place was called Hormah .
4:21:004:0	Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea , to go around the land of Edom ; and the people became impatient because of the journey .
4:21:002:1	The Bronze Serpent
4:21:005:0	The people spoke against God and Moses , “ Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? For there is no food and no water , and we loathe this miserable food . ”
4:21:006:0	The Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people , so that many people of Israel died .
4:21:007:0	So the people came to Moses and said , “ We have sinned , because we have spoken against the Lord and you ; intercede with the Lord , that He may remove the serpents from us . ” And Moses interceded for the people .
4:21:008:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Make a fiery serpent , and set it on a standard ; and it shall come about , that everyone who is bitten , when he looks at it , he will live . ”
4:21:009:0	And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard ; and it came about , that if a serpent bit any man , when he looked to the bronze serpent , he lived .
4:21:010:0	Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth .
4:21:011:0	They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim , in the wilderness which is opposite Moab , to the east .
4:21:012:0	From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered .
4:21:013:0	From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites , for the Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
4:21:014:0	Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord , “ Waheb in Suphah , And the wadis of the Arnon ,
4:21:015:0	And the slope of the wadisThat extends to the site of Ar , And leans to the border of Moab . ”
4:21:016:0	From there they continued to Beer , that is the well where the Lord said to Moses , “ Assemble the people , that I may give them water . ”
4:21:017:0	Then Israel sang this song : “ Spring up , O well ! Sing to it !
4:21:018:0	The well , which the leaders sank , Which the nobles of the people dug , With the scepter and with their staffs . ” And from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah ,
4:21:019:0	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel , and from Nahaliel to Bamoth ,
4:21:003:1	Two Victories
4:21:020:0	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab , at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland .
4:21:021:0	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon , king of the Amorites , saying ,
4:21:022:0	“ Let me pass through your land . We will not turn off into field or vineyard ; we will not drink water from wells . We will go by the king’s highway until we have passed through your border . ”
4:21:023:0	But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border . So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness , and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel .
4:21:024:0	Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword , and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , as far as the sons of Ammon ; for the border of the sons of Ammon was Jazer .
4:21:025:0	Israel took all these cities and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all her villages .
4:21:026:0	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon , king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand , as far as the Arnon .
4:21:027:0	Therefore those who use proverbs say , “ Come to Heshbon ! Let it be built ! So let the city of Sihon be established .
4:21:028:0	For a fire went forth from Heshbon , A flame from the town of Sihon ; It devoured Ar of Moab , The dominant heights of the Arnon .
4:21:029:0	Woe to you , O Moab ! You are ruined , O people of Chemosh ! He has given his sons as fugitives , And his daughters into captivity , To an Amorite king , Sihon .
4:21:030:0	But we have cast them down , Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon , Then we have laid waste even to Nophah , Which reaches to Medeba . ”
4:21:031:0	Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites .
4:21:032:0	Moses sent to spy out Jazer , and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there .
4:21:033:0	Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan , and Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people , for battle at Edrei .
4:21:034:0	But the Lord said to Moses , “ Do not fear him , for I have given him into your hand , and all his people and his land ; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon , king of the Amorites , who lived at Heshbon . ”
4:21:035:0	So they killed him and his sons and all his people , until there was no remnant left him ; and they possessed his land .
