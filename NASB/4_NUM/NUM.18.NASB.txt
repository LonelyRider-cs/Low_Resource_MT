4:18:001:1	Duties of Levites
4:18:001:0	So the Lord said to Aaron , “ You and your sons and your father’s household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary , and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood .
4:18:002:0	But bring with you also your brothers , the tribe of Levi , the tribe of your father , that they may be joined with you and serve you , while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony .
4:18:003:0	And they shall thus attend to your obligation and the obligation of all the tent , but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar , or both they and you will die .
4:18:004:0	They shall be joined with you and attend to the obligations of the tent of meeting , for all the service of the tent ; but an outsider may not come near you .
4:18:005:0	So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary and the obligations of the altar , so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel .
4:18:006:0	Behold , I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel ; they are a gift to you , dedicated to the Lord , to perform the service for the tent of meeting .
4:18:002:1	The Priests’ Portion
4:18:007:0	But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and inside the veil , and you are to perform service . I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service , but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death . ”
4:18:008:0	Then the Lord spoke to Aaron , “ Now behold , I Myself have given you charge of My offerings , even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual allotment .
4:18:009:0	This shall be yours from the most holy gifts reserved from the fire ; every offering of theirs , even every grain offering and every sin offering and every guilt offering , which they shall render to Me , shall be most holy for you and for your sons .
4:18:010:0	As the most holy gifts you shall eat it ; every male shall eat it . It shall be holy to you .
4:18:011:0	This also is yours , the offering of their gift , even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel ; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual allotment . Everyone of your household who is clean may eat it .
4:18:012:0	All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain , the first fruits of those which they give to the Lord , I give them to you .
4:18:013:0	The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land , which they bring to the Lord , shall be yours ; everyone of your household who is clean may eat it .
4:18:014:0	Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours .
4:18:015:0	Every first issue of the womb of all flesh , whether man or animal , which they offer to the Lord , shall be yours ; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem , and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem .
4:18:016:0	As to their redemption price , from a month old you shall redeem them , by your valuation , five shekels in silver , according to the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
4:18:017:0	But the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat , you shall not redeem ; they are holy . You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke as an offering by fire , for a soothing aroma to the Lord .
4:18:018:0	Their meat shall be yours ; it shall be yours like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh .
4:18:019:0	All the offerings of the holy gifts , which the sons of Israel offer to the Lord , I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you , as a perpetual allotment . It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord to you and your descendants with you . ”
4:18:020:0	Then the Lord said to Aaron , “ You shall have no inheritance in their land nor own any portion among them ; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel .
4:18:021:0	“ To the sons of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they perform , the service of the tent of meeting .
4:18:022:0	The sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again , or they will bear sin and die .
4:18:023:0	Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity ; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations , and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
4:18:024:0	For the tithe of the sons of Israel , which they offer as an offering to the Lord , I have given to the Levites for an inheritance ; therefore I have said concerning them , ‘They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel . ’ ”
4:18:025:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:18:026:0	“ Moreover , you shall speak to the Levites and say to them , ‘When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then you shall present an offering from it to the Lord , a tithe of the tithe .
4:18:027:0	Your offering shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the full produce from the wine vat .
4:18:028:0	So you shall also present an offering to the Lord from your tithes , which you receive from the sons of Israel ; and from it you shall give the Lord’s offering to Aaron the priest .
4:18:029:0	Out of all your gifts you shall present every offering due to the Lord , from all the best of them , the sacred part from them . ’
4:18:030:0	You shall say to them , ‘When you have offered from it the best of it , then the rest shall be reckoned to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor , and as the product of the wine vat .
4:18:031:0	You may eat it anywhere , you and your households , for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting .
4:18:032:0	You will bear no sin by reason of it when you have offered the best of it . But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel , or you will die . ’ ”
