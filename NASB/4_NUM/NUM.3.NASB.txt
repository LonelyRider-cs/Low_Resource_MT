4:3:001:1	Levites to Be Priesthood
4:3:001:0	Now these are the records of the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the Lord spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai .
4:3:002:0	These then are the names of the sons of Aaron : Nadab the firstborn , and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
4:3:003:0	These are the names of the sons of Aaron , the anointed priests , whom he ordained to serve as priests .
4:3:004:0	But Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai ; and they had no children . So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron .
4:3:005:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:3:006:0	“ Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest , that they may serve him .
4:3:007:0	They shall perform the duties for him and for the whole congregation before the tent of meeting , to do the service of the tabernacle .
4:3:008:0	They shall also keep all the furnishings of the tent of meeting , along with the duties of the sons of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
4:3:009:0	You shall thus give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons ; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel .
4:3:010:0	So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood , but the layman who comes near shall be put to death . ”
4:3:011:0	Again the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:3:012:0	“ Now , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn , the first issue of the womb among the sons of Israel . So the Levites shall be Mine .
4:3:013:0	For all the firstborn are Mine ; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel , from man to beast . They shall be Mine ; I am the Lord . ”
4:3:014:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , saying ,
4:3:015:0	“ Number the sons of Levi by their fathers’ households , by their families ; every male from a month old and upward you shall number . ”
4:3:016:0	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord , just as he had been commanded .
4:3:017:0	These then are the sons of Levi by their names : Gershon and Kohath and Merari .
4:3:018:0	These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families : Libni and Shimei ;
4:3:019:0	and the sons of Kohath by their families : Amram and Izhar , Hebron and Uzziel ;
4:3:020:0	and the sons of Merari by their families : Mahli and Mushi . These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers’ households .
4:3:021:0	Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites ; these were the families of the Gershonites .
4:3:022:0	Their numbered men , in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward , even their numbered men were 7 , 500 .
4:3:023:0	The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward ,
4:3:002:1	Duties of the Priests
4:3:024:0	and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael .
4:3:025:0	Now the duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle and the tent , its covering , and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting ,
4:3:026:0	and the hangings of the court , and the screen for the doorway of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar , and its cords , according to all the service concerning them .
4:3:027:0	Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites and the family of the Hebronites and the family of the Uzzielites ; these were the families of the Kohathites .
4:3:028:0	In the numbering of every male from a month old and upward , there were 8 , 600 , performing the duties of the sanctuary .
4:3:029:0	The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the southward side of the tabernacle ,
4:3:030:0	and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel .
4:3:031:0	Now their duties involved the ark , the table , the lampstand , the altars , and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister , and the screen , and all the service concerning them ;
4:3:032:0	and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was the chief of the leaders of Levi , and had the oversight of those who perform the duties of the sanctuary .
4:3:033:0	Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites ; these were the families of Merari .
4:3:034:0	Their numbered men in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward , were 6 , 200 .
4:3:035:0	The leader of the fathers’ households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail . They were to camp on the northward side of the tabernacle .
4:3:036:0	Now the appointed duties of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle , its bars , its pillars , its sockets , all its equipment , and the service concerning them ,
4:3:037:0	and the pillars around the court with their sockets and their pegs and their cords .
4:3:038:0	Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle eastward , before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise , are Moses and Aaron and his sons , performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel ; but the layman coming near was to be put to death .
4:3:003:1	Firstborn Redeemed
4:3:039:0	All the numbered men of the Levites , whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of the Lord by their families , every male from a month old and upward , were 22 , 000 .
4:3:040:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward , and make a list of their names .
4:3:041:0	You shall take the Levites for Me , I am the Lord , instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel , and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel . ”
4:3:042:0	So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel , just as the Lord had commanded him ;
4:3:043:0	and all the firstborn males by the number of names from a month old and upward , for their numbered men were 22 , 273 .
4:3:044:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:3:045:0	“ Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel and the cattle of the Levites . And the Levites shall be Mine ; I am the Lord .
4:3:046:0	For the ransom of the 273 of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who are in excess beyond the Levites ,
4:3:047:0	you shall take five shekels apiece , per head ; you shall take them in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary ( the shekel is twenty gerahs ) ,
4:3:048:0	and give the money , the ransom of those who are in excess among them , to Aaron and to his sons . ”
4:3:049:0	So Moses took the ransom money from those who were in excess , beyond those ransomed by the Levites ;
4:3:050:0	from the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary , 1 , 365 .
4:3:051:0	Then Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and to his sons , at the command of the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
