4:17:001:1	Aaron’s Rod Buds
4:17:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:17:002:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel , and get from them a rod for each father’s household : twelve rods , from all their leaders according to their fathers’ households . You shall write each name on his rod ,
4:17:003:0	and write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi ; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers’ households .
4:17:004:0	You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony , where I meet with you .
4:17:005:0	It will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout . Thus I will lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel , who are grumbling against you . ”
4:17:006:0	Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel , and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece , for each leader according to their fathers’ households , twelve rods , with the rod of Aaron among their rods .
4:17:007:0	So Moses deposited the rods before the Lord in the tent of the testimony .
4:17:008:0	Now on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony ; and behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms , and it bore ripe almonds .
4:17:009:0	Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the Lord to all the sons of Israel ; and they looked , and each man took his rod .
4:17:010:0	But the Lord said to Moses , “ Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels , that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me , so that they will not die . ”
4:17:011:0	Thus Moses did ; just as the Lord had commanded him , so he did .
4:17:012:0	Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses , saying , “ Behold , we perish , we are dying , we are all dying !
4:17:013:0	Everyone who comes near , who comes near to the tabernacle of the Lord , must die . Are we to perish completely ? ”
