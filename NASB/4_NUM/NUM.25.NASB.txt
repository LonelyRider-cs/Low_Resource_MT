4:25:001:1	The Sin of Peor
4:25:001:0	While Israel remained at Shittim , the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab .
4:25:002:0	For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods , and the people ate and bowed down to their gods .
4:25:003:0	So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor , and the Lord was angry against Israel .
4:25:004:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the Lord , so that the fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel . ”
4:25:005:0	So Moses said to the judges of Israel , “ Each of you slay his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor . ”
4:25:006:0	Then behold , one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives a Midianite woman , in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel , while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting .
4:25:007:0	When Phinehas the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand ,
4:25:008:0	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through , the man of Israel and the woman , through the body . So the plague on the sons of Israel was checked .
4:25:002:1	The Zeal of Phinehas
4:25:009:0	Those who died by the plague were 24 , 000 .
4:25:010:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:25:011:0	“ Phinehas the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them , so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy .
4:25:012:0	Therefore say , ‘Behold , I give him My covenant of peace ;
4:25:013:0	and it shall be for him and his descendants after him , a covenant of a perpetual priesthood , because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel . ’ ”
4:25:014:0	Now the name of the slain man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman , was Zimri the son of Salu , a leader of a father’s household among the Simeonites .
4:25:015:0	The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur , who was head of the people of a father’s household in Midian .
4:25:016:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:25:017:0	“ Be hostile to the Midianites and strike them ;
4:25:018:0	for they have been hostile to you with their tricks , with which they have deceived you in the affair of Peor and in the affair of Cozbi , the daughter of the leader of Midian , their sister who was slain on the day of the plague because of Peor . ”
