4:6:001:1	Law of the Nazirites
4:6:001:0	Again the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:6:002:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘When a man or woman makes a special vow , the vow of a Nazirite , to dedicate himself to the Lord ,
4:6:003:0	he shall abstain from wine and strong drink ; he shall drink no vinegar , whether made from wine or strong drink , nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes .
4:6:004:0	All the days of his separation he shall not eat anything that is produced by the grape vine , from the seeds even to the skin .
4:6:005:0	‘All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall pass over his head . He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to the Lord ; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long .
4:6:006:0	‘All the days of his separation to the Lord he shall not go near to a dead person .
4:6:007:0	He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother , for his brother or for his sister , when they die , because his separation to God is on his head .
4:6:008:0	All the days of his separation he is holy to the Lord .
4:6:009:0	‘But if a man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his dedicated head of hair , then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean ; he shall shave it on the seventh day .
4:6:010:0	Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest , to the doorway of the tent of meeting .
4:6:011:0	The priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering , and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the dead person . And that same day he shall consecrate his head ,
4:6:012:0	and shall dedicate to the Lord his days as a Nazirite , and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering ; but the former days will be void because his separation was defiled .
4:6:013:0	‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled , he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the tent of meeting .
4:6:014:0	He shall present his offering to the Lord : one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering and one ewe-lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering and one ram without defect for a peace offering ,
4:6:015:0	and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil , along with their grain offering and their drink offering .
4:6:016:0	Then the priest shall present them before the Lord and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering .
4:6:017:0	He shall also offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord , together with the basket of unleavened cakes ; the priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its drink offering .
4:6:018:0	The Nazirite shall then shave his dedicated head of hair at the doorway of the tent of meeting , and take the dedicated hair of his head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings .
4:6:019:0	The priest shall take the ram’s shoulder when it has been boiled , and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer , and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated hair .
4:6:020:0	Then the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord . It is holy for the priest , together with the breast offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up ; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine . ’
4:6:002:1	Aaron’s Benediction
4:6:021:0	“ This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the Lord according to his separation , in addition to what else he can afford ; according to his vow which he takes , so he shall do according to the law of his separation . ”
4:6:022:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:6:023:0	“ Speak to Aaron and to his sons , saying , ‘Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel . You shall say to them :
4:6:024:0	The Lord bless you , and keep you ;
4:6:025:0	The Lord make His face shine on you , And be gracious to you ;
4:6:026:0	The Lord lift up His countenance on you , And give you peace . ’
4:6:027:0	So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel , and I then will bless them . ”
