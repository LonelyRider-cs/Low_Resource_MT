4:10:001:1	The Silver Trumpets
4:10:001:0	The Lord spoke further to Moses , saying ,
4:10:002:0	“ Make yourself two trumpets of silver , of hammered work you shall make them ; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out .
4:10:003:0	When both are blown , all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the doorway of the tent of meeting .
4:10:004:0	Yet if only one is blown , then the leaders , the heads of the divisions of Israel , shall assemble before you .
4:10:005:0	But when you blow an alarm , the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out .
4:10:006:0	When you blow an alarm the second time , the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out ; an alarm is to be blown for them to set out .
4:10:007:0	When convening the assembly , however , you shall blow without sounding an alarm .
4:10:008:0	The priestly sons of Aaron , moreover , shall blow the trumpets ; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations .
4:10:009:0	When you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you , then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets , that you may be remembered before the Lord your God , and be saved from your enemies .
4:10:002:1	The Tribes Leave Sinai
4:10:010:0	Also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed feasts , and on the first days of your months , you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings , and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings ; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God . I am the Lord your God . ”
4:10:011:0	Now in the second year , in the second month , on the twentieth of the month , the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony ;
4:10:012:0	and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai . Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran .
4:10:013:0	So they moved out for the first time according to the commandment of the Lord through Moses .
4:10:014:0	The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah , according to their armies , set out first , with Nahshon the son of Amminadab , over its army ,
4:10:015:0	and Nethanel the son of Zuar , over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar ;
4:10:016:0	and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun .
4:10:017:0	Then the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari , who were carrying the tabernacle , set out .
4:10:018:0	Next the standard of the camp of Reuben , according to their armies , set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur , over its army ,
4:10:019:0	and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon ,
4:10:020:0	and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the tribal army of the sons of Gad .
4:10:021:0	Then the Kohathites set out , carrying the holy objects ; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival .
4:10:022:0	Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim , according to their armies , was set out , with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army ,
4:10:023:0	and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh ;
4:10:024:0	and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin .
4:10:025:0	Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan , according to their armies , which formed the rear guard for all the camps , set out , with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army ,
4:10:026:0	and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher ;
4:10:027:0	and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali .
4:10:028:0	This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out .
4:10:029:0	Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite , Moses’ father-in-law , “ We are setting out to the place of which the Lord said , ‘I will give it to you’ ; come with us and we will do you good , for the Lord has promised good concerning Israel . ”
4:10:030:0	But he said to him , “ I will not come , but rather will go to my own land and relatives . ”
4:10:031:0	Then he said , “ Please do not leave us , inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness , and you will be as eyes for us .
4:10:032:0	So it will be , if you go with us , that whatever good the Lord does for us , we will do for you . ”
4:10:033:0	Thus they set out from the mount of the Lord three days’ journey , with the ark of the covenant of the Lord journeying in front of them for the three days , to seek out a resting place for them .
4:10:034:0	The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp .
4:10:035:0	Then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said , “ Rise up , O Lord ! And let Your enemies be scattered , And let those who hate You flee before You . ”
4:10:036:0	When it came to rest , he said , “ Return , O Lord , To the myriad thousands of Israel . ”
