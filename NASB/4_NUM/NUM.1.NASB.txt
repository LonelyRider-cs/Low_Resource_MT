4:1:001:1	The Census of Israel’s Warriors
4:1:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tent of meeting , on the first of the second month , in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
4:1:002:0	“ Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel , by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , every male , head by head
4:1:003:0	from twenty years old and upward , whoever is able to go out to war in Israel , you and Aaron shall number them by their armies .
4:1:004:0	With you , moreover , there shall be a man of each tribe , each one head of his father’s household .
4:1:005:0	These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you : of Reuben , Elizur the son of Shedeur ;

4:1:016:0	These are they who were called of the congregation , the leaders of their fathers’ tribes ; they were the heads of divisions of Israel . ”
4:1:017:0	So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name ,
4:1:018:0	and they assembled all the congregation together on the first of the second month . Then they registered by ancestry in their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , head by head ,
4:1:019:0	just as the Lord had commanded Moses . So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai .
4:1:020:0	Now the sons of Reuben , Israel’s firstborn , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , head by head , every male from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,

4:1:026:0	Of the sons of Judah , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,

4:1:028:0	Of the sons of Issachar , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:029:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Issachar were 54 , 400 .
4:1:030:0	Of the sons of Zebulun , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:031:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Zebulun were 57 , 400 .
4:1:032:0	Of the sons of Joseph , namely , of the sons of Ephraim , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:033:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Ephraim were 40 , 500 .
4:1:034:0	Of the sons of Manasseh , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:035:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Manasseh were 32 , 200 .
4:1:036:0	Of the sons of Benjamin , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:037:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Benjamin were 35 , 400 .
4:1:038:0	Of the sons of Dan , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:039:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Dan were 62 , 700 .
4:1:040:0	Of the sons of Asher , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:041:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Asher were 41 , 500 .
4:1:042:0	Of the sons of Naphtali , their genealogical registration by their families , by their fathers’ households , according to the number of names , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war ,
4:1:043:0	their numbered men of the tribe of Naphtali were 53 , 400 .
4:1:044:0	These are the ones who were numbered , whom Moses and Aaron numbered , with the leaders of Israel , twelve men , each of whom was of his father’s household .
4:1:045:0	So all the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ households , from twenty years old and upward , whoever was able to go out to war in Israel ,
4:1:002:1	Levites Exempted
4:1:046:0	even all the numbered men were 603 , 550 .
4:1:047:0	The Levites , however , were not numbered among them by their fathers’ tribe .
4:1:048:0	For the Lord had spoken to Moses , saying ,
4:1:049:0	“ Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number , nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel .
4:1:050:0	But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony , and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it . They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings , and they shall take care of it ; they shall also camp around the tabernacle .
4:1:051:0	So when the tabernacle is to set out , the Levites shall take it down ; and when the tabernacle encamps , the Levites shall set it up . But the layman who comes near shall be put to death .
4:1:052:0	The sons of Israel shall camp , each man by his own camp , and each man by his own standard , according to their armies .
4:1:053:0	But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony , so that there will be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel . So the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the testimony . ”
4:1:054:0	Thus the sons of Israel did ; according to all which the Lord had commanded Moses , so they did .
