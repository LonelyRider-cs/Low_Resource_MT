4:20:001:1	Death of Miriam
4:20:001:0	Then the sons of Israel , the whole congregation , came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month ; and the people stayed at Kadesh . Now Miriam died there and was buried there .
4:20:002:0	There was no water for the congregation , and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron .
4:20:003:0	The people thus contended with Moses and spoke , saying , “ If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the Lord !
4:20:004:0	Why then have you brought the Lord’s assembly into this wilderness , for us and our beasts to die here ?
4:20:005:0	Why have you made us come up from Egypt , to bring us in to this wretched place ? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates , nor is there water to drink . ”
4:20:006:0	Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces . Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them ;
4:20:002:1	The Water of Meribah
4:20:007:0	and the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:20:008:0	“ Take the rod ; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes , that it may yield its water . You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink . ”
4:20:009:0	So Moses took the rod from before the Lord , just as He had commanded him ;
4:20:010:0	and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock . And he said to them , “ Listen now , you rebels ; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock ? ”
4:20:011:0	Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod ; and water came forth abundantly , and the congregation and their beasts drank .
4:20:012:0	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Because you have not believed Me , to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel , therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them . ”
4:20:013:0	Those were the waters of Meribah , because the sons of Israel contended with the Lord , and He proved Himself holy among them .
4:20:014:0	From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom : “ Thus your brother Israel has said , ‘You know all the hardship that has befallen us ;
4:20:015:0	that our fathers went down to Egypt , and we stayed in Egypt a long time , and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly .
4:20:016:0	But when we cried out to the Lord , He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt ; now behold , we are at Kadesh , a town on the edge of your territory .
4:20:017:0	Please let us pass through your land . We will not pass through field or through vineyard ; we will not even drink water from a well . We will go along the king’s highway , not turning to the right or left , until we pass through your territory . ’ ”
4:20:018:0	Edom , however , said to him , “ You shall not pass through us , or I will come out with the sword against you . ”
4:20:019:0	Again , the sons of Israel said to him , “ We will go up by the highway , and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water , then I will pay its price . Let me only pass through on my feet , nothing else . ”
4:20:020:0	But he said , “ You shall not pass through . ” And Edom came out against him with a heavy force and with a strong hand .
4:20:021:0	Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory ; so Israel turned away from him .
4:20:003:1	Death of Aaron
4:20:022:0	Now when they set out from Kadesh , the sons of Israel , the whole congregation , came to Mount Hor .
4:20:023:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom , saying ,
4:20:024:0	“ Aaron will be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel , because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah .
4:20:025:0	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor ;
4:20:026:0	and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar . So Aaron will be gathered to his people , and will die there . ”
4:20:027:0	So Moses did just as the Lord had commanded , and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
4:20:028:0	After Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar , Aaron died there on the mountain top . Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain .
4:20:029:0	When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died , all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days .
