4:22:001:1	Balak Sends for Balaam
4:22:001:0	Then the sons of Israel journeyed , and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho .
4:22:002:0	Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
4:22:003:0	So Moab was in great fear because of the people , for they were numerous ; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel .
4:22:004:0	Moab said to the elders of Midian , “ Now this horde will lick up all that is around us , as the ox licks up the grass of the field . ” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time .
4:22:005:0	So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor , at Pethor , which is near the River , in the land of the sons of his people , to call him , saying , “ Behold , a people came out of Egypt ; behold , they cover the surface of the land , and they are living opposite me .
4:22:006:0	Now , therefore , please come , curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me ; perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land . For I know that he whom you bless is blessed , and he whom you curse is cursed . ”
4:22:007:0	So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand ; and they came to Balaam and repeated Balak’s words to him .
4:22:008:0	He said to them , “ Spend the night here , and I will bring word back to you as the Lord may speak to me . ” And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam .
4:22:009:0	Then God came to Balaam and said , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
4:22:010:0	Balaam said to God , “ Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , has sent word to me ,
4:22:011:0	‘Behold , there is a people who came out of Egypt and they cover the surface of the land ; now come , curse them for me ; perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out . ’ ”
4:22:012:0	God said to Balaam , “ Do not go with them ; you shall not curse the people , for they are blessed . ”
4:22:013:0	So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak’s leaders , “ Go back to your land , for the Lord has refused to let me go with you . ”
4:22:014:0	The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak and said , “ Balaam refused to come with us . ”
4:22:015:0	Then Balak again sent leaders , more numerous and more distinguished than the former .
4:22:016:0	They came to Balaam and said to him , “ Thus says Balak the son of Zippor , ‘Let nothing , I beg you , hinder you from coming to me ;
4:22:017:0	for I will indeed honor you richly , and I will do whatever you say to me . Please come then , curse this people for me . ’ ”
4:22:018:0	Balaam replied to the servants of Balak , “ Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold , I could not do anything , either small or great , contrary to the command of the Lord my God .
4:22:019:0	Now please , you also stay here tonight , and I will find out what else the Lord will speak to me . ”
4:22:020:0	God came to Balaam at night and said to him , “ If the men have come to call you , rise up and go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you shall you do . ”
4:22:002:1	The Angel and Balaam
4:22:021:0	So Balaam arose in the morning , and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab .
4:22:022:0	But God was angry because he was going , and the angel of the Lord took his stand in the way as an adversary against him . Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him .
4:22:023:0	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand , the donkey turned off from the way and went into the field ; but Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way .
4:22:024:0	Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path of the vineyards , with a wall on this side and a wall on that side .
4:22:025:0	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , she pressed herself to the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall , so he struck her again .
4:22:026:0	The angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right hand or the left .
4:22:027:0	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , she lay down under Balaam ; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his stick .
4:22:028:0	And the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey , and she said to Balaam , “ What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? ”
4:22:029:0	Then Balaam said to the donkey , “ Because you have made a mockery of me ! If there had been a sword in my hand , I would have killed you by now . ”
4:22:030:0	The donkey said to Balaam , “ Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day ? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you ? ” And he said , “ No . ”
4:22:031:0	Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand ; and he bowed all the way to the ground .
4:22:032:0	The angel of the Lord said to him , “ Why have you struck your donkey these three times ? Behold , I have come out as an adversary , because your way was contrary to me .
4:22:033:0	But the donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times . If she had not turned aside from me , I would surely have killed you just now , and let her live . ”
4:22:034:0	Balaam said to the angel of the Lord , “ I have sinned , for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me . Now then , if it is displeasing to you , I will turn back . ”
4:22:035:0	But the angel of the Lord said to Balaam , “ Go with the men , but you shall speak only the word which I tell you . ” So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak .
4:22:036:0	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming , he went out to meet him at the city of Moab , which is on the Arnon border , at the extreme end of the border .
4:22:037:0	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Did I not urgently send to you to call you ? Why did you not come to me ? Am I really unable to honor you ? ”
4:22:038:0	So Balaam said to Balak , “ Behold , I have come now to you ! Am I able to speak anything at all ? The word that God puts in my mouth , that I shall speak . ”
4:22:039:0	And Balaam went with Balak , and they came to Kiriath-huzoth .
4:22:040:0	Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep , and sent some to Balaam and the leaders who were with him .
4:22:041:0	Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal , and he saw from there a portion of the people .
