4:12:001:1	The Murmuring of Miriam and Aaron
4:12:001:0	Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married ( for he had married a Cushite woman ) ;
4:12:002:0	and they said , “ Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses ? Has He not spoken through us as well ? ” And the Lord heard it .
4:12:003:0	( Now the man Moses was very humble , more than any man who was on the face of the earth . )
4:12:004:0	Suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam , “ You three come out to the tent of meeting . ” So the three of them came out .
4:12:005:0	Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent , and He called Aaron and Miriam . When they had both come forward ,
4:12:006:0	He said , “ Hear now My words : If there is a prophet among you , I , the Lord , shall make Myself known to him in a vision . I shall speak with him in a dream .
4:12:007:0	Not so , with My servant Moses , He is faithful in all My household ;
4:12:008:0	With him I speak mouth to mouth , Even openly , and not in dark sayings , And he beholds the form of the Lord . Why then were you not afraidTo speak against My servant , against Moses ? ”
4:12:009:0	So the anger of the Lord burned against them and He departed .
4:12:010:0	But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent , behold , Miriam was leprous , as white as snow . As Aaron turned toward Miriam , behold , she was leprous .
4:12:011:0	Then Aaron said to Moses , “ Oh , my lord , I beg you , do not account this sin to us , in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned .
4:12:012:0	Oh , do not let her be like one dead , whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes from his mother’s womb ! ”
4:12:013:0	Moses cried out to the Lord , saying , “ O God , heal her , I pray ! ”
4:12:014:0	But the Lord said to Moses , “ If her father had but spit in her face , would she not bear her shame for seven days ? Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp , and afterward she may be received again . ”
4:12:015:0	So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days , and the people did not move on until Miriam was received again .
4:12:016:0	Afterward , however , the people moved out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran .
