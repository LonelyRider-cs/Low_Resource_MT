4:34:001:1	Instruction for Apportioning Canaan
4:34:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:34:002:0	“ Command the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘When you enter the land of Canaan , this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance , even the land of Canaan according to its borders .
4:34:003:0	Your southern sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom , and your southern border shall extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward .
4:34:004:0	Then your border shall turn direction from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin , and its termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea ; and it shall reach Hazaraddar and continue to Azmon .
4:34:005:0	The border shall turn direction from Azmon to the brook of Egypt , and its termination shall be at the sea .
4:34:006:0	‘As for the western border , you shall have the Great Sea , that is , its coastline ; this shall be your west border .
4:34:007:0	‘And this shall be your north border : you shall draw your border line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor .
4:34:008:0	You shall draw a line from Mount Hor to the Lebo-hamath , and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad ;
4:34:009:0	and the border shall proceed to Ziphron , and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan . This shall be your north border .
4:34:010:0	‘For your eastern border you shall also draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham ,
4:34:011:0	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth .
4:34:012:0	And the border shall go down to the Jordan and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea . This shall be your land according to its borders all around . ’ ”
4:34:013:0	So Moses commanded the sons of Israel , saying , “ This is the land that you are to apportion by lot among you as a possession , which the Lord has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes .
4:34:014:0	For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received theirs according to their fathers’ households , and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers’ households , and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession .
4:34:015:0	The two and a half tribes have received their possession across the Jordan opposite Jericho , eastward toward the sunrising . ”
4:34:016:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:34:017:0	“ These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance : Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun .
4:34:018:0	You shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance .
4:34:019:0	These are the names of the men : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
4:34:020:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon , Samuel the son of Ammihud .
4:34:021:0	Of the tribe of Benjamin , Elidad the son of Chislon .
4:34:022:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader , Bukki the son of Jogli .
4:34:023:0	Of the sons of Joseph : of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
4:34:024:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader , Kemuel the son of Shiphtan .
4:34:025:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader , Elizaphan the son of Parnach .
4:34:026:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader , Paltiel the son of Azzan .
4:34:027:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader , Ahihud the son of Shelomi .
4:34:028:0	Of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader , Pedahel the son of Ammihud . ”
4:34:029:0	These are those whom the Lord commanded to apportion the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan .
