4:19:001:1	Ordinance of the Red Heifer
4:19:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
4:19:002:0	“ This is the statute of the law which the Lord has commanded , saying , ‘Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring you an unblemished red heifer in which is no defect and on which a yoke has never been placed .
4:19:003:0	You shall give it to Eleazar the priest , and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence .
4:19:004:0	Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times .
4:19:005:0	Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight ; its hide and its flesh and its blood , with its refuse , shall be burned .
4:19:006:0	The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet material and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer .
4:19:007:0	The priest shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water , and afterward come into the camp , but the priest shall be unclean until evening .
4:19:008:0	The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water , and shall be unclean until evening .
4:19:009:0	Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place , and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity ; it is purification from sin .
4:19:010:0	The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening ; and it shall be a perpetual statute to the sons of Israel and to the alien who sojourns among them .
4:19:011:0	‘The one who touches the corpse of any person shall be unclean for seven days .
4:19:012:0	That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water on the third day and on the seventh day , and then he will be clean ; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day , he will not be clean .
4:19:013:0	Anyone who touches a corpse , the body of a man who has died , and does not purify himself , defiles the tabernacle of the Lord ; and that person shall be cut off from Israel . Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is still on him .
4:19:014:0	‘This is the law when a man dies in a tent : everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days .
4:19:015:0	Every open vessel , which has no covering tied down on it , shall be unclean .
4:19:016:0	Also , anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or who has died naturally , or a human bone or a grave , shall be unclean for seven days .
4:19:017:0	Then for the unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt purification from sin and flowing water shall be added to them in a vessel .
4:19:018:0	A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there , and on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one dying naturally or the grave .
4:19:019:0	Then the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day ; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness , and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean by evening .
4:19:020:0	‘But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself from uncleanness , that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly , because he has defiled the sanctuary of the Lord ; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him , he is unclean .
4:19:021:0	So it shall be a perpetual statute for them . And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening .
4:19:022:0	Furthermore , anything that the unclean person touches shall be unclean ; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening . ’ ”
