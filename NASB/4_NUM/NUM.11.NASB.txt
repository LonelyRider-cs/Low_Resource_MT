4:11:001:1	The People Complain
4:11:001:0	Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the Lord ; and when the Lord heard it , His anger was kindled , and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
4:11:002:0	The people therefore cried out to Moses , and Moses prayed to the Lord and the fire died out .
4:11:003:0	So the name of that place was called Taberah , because the fire of the Lord burned among them .
4:11:004:0	The rabble who were among them had greedy desires ; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said , “ Who will give us meat to eat ?
4:11:005:0	We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt , the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic ,
4:11:006:0	but now our appetite is gone . There is nothing at all to look at except this manna . ”
4:11:007:0	Now the manna was like coriander seed , and its appearance like that of bdellium .
4:11:008:0	The people would go about and gather it and grind it between two millstones or beat it in the mortar , and boil it in the pot and make cakes with it ; and its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil .
4:11:002:1	The Complaint of Moses
4:11:009:0	When the dew fell on the camp at night , the manna would fall with it .
4:11:010:0	Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families , each man at the doorway of his tent ; and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly , and Moses was displeased .
4:11:011:0	So Moses said to the Lord , “ Why have You been so hard on Your servant ? And why have I not found favor in Your sight , that You have laid the burden of all this people on me ?
4:11:012:0	Was it I who conceived all this people ? Was it I who brought them forth , that You should say to me , ‘Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing infant , to the land which You swore to their fathers’ ?
4:11:013:0	Where am I to get meat to give to all this people ? For they weep before me , saying , ‘Give us meat that we may eat ! ’
4:11:014:0	I alone am not able to carry all this people , because it is too burdensome for me .
4:11:003:1	Seventy Elders to Assist
4:11:015:0	So if You are going to deal thus with me , please kill me at once , if I have found favor in Your sight , and do not let me see my wretchedness . ”
4:11:016:0	The Lord therefore said to Moses , “ Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers and bring them to the tent of meeting , and let them take their stand there with you .
4:11:017:0	Then I will come down and speak with you there , and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you , and will put Him upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , so that you will not bear it all alone .
4:11:018:0	Say to the people , ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow , and you shall eat meat ; for you have wept in the ears of the Lord , saying , “ Oh that someone would give us meat to eat ! For we were well-off in Egypt . ” Therefore the Lord will give you meat and you shall eat .
4:11:019:0	You shall eat , not one day , nor two days , nor five days , nor ten days , nor twenty days ,
4:11:020:0	but a whole month , until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you ; because you have rejected the Lord who is among you and have wept before Him , saying , “ Why did we ever leave Egypt ? ” ’ ”
4:11:021:0	But Moses said , “ The people , among whom I am , are 600 , 000 on foot ; yet You have said , ‘I will give them meat , so that they may eat for a whole month . ’
4:11:022:0	Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to be sufficient for them ? Or should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? ”
4:11:023:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ Is the Lord’s power limited ? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not . ”
4:11:024:0	So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord . Also , he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people , and stationed them around the tent .
4:11:025:0	Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him ; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders . And when the Spirit rested upon them , they prophesied . But they did not do it again .
4:11:026:0	But two men had remained in the camp ; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad . And the Spirit rested upon them ( now they were among those who had been registered , but had not gone out to the tent ) , and they prophesied in the camp .
4:11:027:0	So a young man ran and told Moses and said , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp . ”
4:11:028:0	Then Joshua the son of Nun , the attendant of Moses from his youth , said , “ Moses , my lord , restrain them . ”
4:11:029:0	But Moses said to him , “ Are you jealous for my sake ? Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets , that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them ! ”
4:11:004:1	The Quail and the Plague
4:11:030:0	Then Moses returned to the camp , both he and the elders of Israel .
4:11:031:0	Now there went forth a wind from the Lord and it brought quail from the sea , and let them fall beside the camp , about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side , all around the camp and about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground .
4:11:032:0	The people spent all day and all night and all the next day , and gathered the quail ( he who gathered least gathered ten homers ) and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp .
4:11:033:0	While the meat was still between their teeth , before it was chewed , the anger of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord struck the people with a very severe plague .
4:11:034:0	So the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah , because there they buried the people who had been greedy .
4:11:035:0	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth , and they remained at Hazeroth .
