4:8:001:1	The Seven Lamps
4:8:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:8:002:0	“ Speak to Aaron and say to him , ‘When you mount the lamps , the seven lamps will give light in the front of the lampstand . ’ ”
4:8:003:0	Aaron therefore did so ; he mounted its lamps at the front of the lampstand , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:8:002:1	Cleansing the Levites
4:8:004:0	Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand , hammered work of gold ; from its base to its flowers it was hammered work ; according to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses , so he made the lampstand .
4:8:005:0	Again the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:8:006:0	“ Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them .
4:8:007:0	Thus you shall do to them , for their cleansing : sprinkle purifying water on them , and let them use a razor over their whole body and wash their clothes , and they will be clean .
4:8:008:0	Then let them take a bull with its grain offering , fine flour mixed with oil ; and a second bull you shall take for a sin offering .
4:8:009:0	So you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting . You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel ,
4:8:010:0	and present the Levites before the Lord ; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites .
4:8:011:0	Aaron then shall present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the sons of Israel , that they may qualify to perform the service of the Lord .
4:8:012:0	Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls ; then offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the Lord , to make atonement for the Levites .
4:8:013:0	You shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and before his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to the Lord .
4:8:014:0	“ Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel , and the Levites shall be Mine .
4:8:015:0	Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting . But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering ;
4:8:016:0	for they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel . I have taken them for Myself instead of every first issue of the womb , the firstborn of all the sons of Israel .
4:8:017:0	For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine , among the men and among the animals ; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself .
4:8:018:0	But I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel .
4:8:019:0	I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel , to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel , so that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel by their coming near to the sanctuary . ”
4:8:020:0	Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel to the Levites ; according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so the sons of Israel did to them .
4:8:021:0	The Levites , too , purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes ; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the Lord . Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them .
4:8:003:1	Retirement
4:8:022:0	Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons ; just as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so they did to them .
4:8:023:0	Now the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:8:024:0	“ This is what applies to the Levites : from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting .
4:8:025:0	But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from service in the work and not work any more .
4:8:026:0	They may , however , assist their brothers in the tent of meeting , to keep an obligation , but they themselves shall do no work . Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their obligations . ”
