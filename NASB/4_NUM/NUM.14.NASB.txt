4:14:001:1	The People Rebel
4:14:001:0	Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried , and the people wept that night .
4:14:002:0	All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron ; and the whole congregation said to them , “ Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! Or would that we had died in this wilderness !
4:14:003:0	Why is the Lord bringing us into this land , to fall by the sword ? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder ; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt ? ”
4:14:004:0	So they said to one another , “ Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt . ”
4:14:005:0	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel .
4:14:006:0	Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , of those who had spied out the land , tore their clothes ;
4:14:007:0	and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel , saying , “ The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land .
4:14:008:0	If the Lord is pleased with us , then He will bring us into this land and give it to us—a land which flows with milk and honey .
4:14:009:0	Only do not rebel against the Lord ; and do not fear the people of the land , for they will be our prey . Their protection has been removed from them , and the Lord is with us ; do not fear them . ”
4:14:002:1	Moses Pleads for the People
4:14:010:0	But all the congregation said to stone them with stones . Then the glory of the Lord appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel .
4:14:011:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ How long will this people spurn Me ? And how long will they not believe in Me , despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst ?
4:14:012:0	I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them , and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they . ”
4:14:013:0	But Moses said to the Lord , “ Then the Egyptians will hear of it , for by Your strength You brought up this people from their midst ,
4:14:014:0	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land . They have heard that You , O Lord , are in the midst of this people , for You , O Lord , are seen eye to eye , while Your cloud stands over them ; and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night .
4:14:015:0	Now if You slay this people as one man , then the nations who have heard of Your fame will say ,
4:14:016:0	‘Because the Lord could not bring this people into the land which He promised them by oath , therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness . ’
4:14:017:0	But now , I pray , let the power of the Lord be great , just as You have declared ,
4:14:018:0	‘The Lord is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness , forgiving iniquity and transgression ; but He will by no means clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generations . ’
4:14:003:1	The L
4:14:004:1	ord
4:14:005:1	Pardons and Rebukes
4:14:019:0	Pardon , I pray , the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness , just as You also have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now . ”
4:14:020:0	So the Lord said , “ I have pardoned them according to your word ;
4:14:021:0	but indeed , as I live , all the earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord .
4:14:022:0	Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My signs which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice ,
4:14:023:0	shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers , nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it .
4:14:024:0	But My servant Caleb , because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully , I will bring into the land which he entered , and his descendants shall take possession of it .
4:14:025:0	Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys ; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea . ”
4:14:026:0	The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
4:14:027:0	“ How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me ? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel , which they are making against Me .
4:14:028:0	Say to them , ‘As I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘just as you have spoken in My hearing , so I will surely do to you ;
4:14:029:0	your corpses will fall in this wilderness , even all your numbered men , according to your complete number from twenty years old and upward , who have grumbled against Me .
4:14:030:0	Surely you shall not come into the land in which I swore to settle you , except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun .
4:14:031:0	Your children , however , whom you said would become a prey—I will bring them in , and they will know the land which you have rejected .
4:14:032:0	But as for you , your corpses will fall in this wilderness .
4:14:033:0	Your sons shall be shepherds for forty years in the wilderness , and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness , until your corpses lie in the wilderness .
4:14:034:0	According to the number of days which you spied out the land , forty days , for every day you shall bear your guilt a year , even forty years , and you will know My opposition .
4:14:035:0	I , the Lord , have spoken , surely this I will do to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me . In this wilderness they shall be destroyed , and there they will die . ’ ”
4:14:036:0	As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land ,
4:14:037:0	even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague before the Lord .
4:14:006:1	Israel Repulsed
4:14:038:0	But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land .
4:14:039:0	When Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel , the people mourned greatly .
4:14:040:0	In the morning , however , they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country , saying , “ Here we are ; we have indeed sinned , but we will go up to the place which the Lord has promised . ”
4:14:041:0	But Moses said , “ Why then are you transgressing the commandment of the Lord , when it will not succeed ?
4:14:042:0	Do not go up , or you will be struck down before your enemies , for the Lord is not among you .
4:14:043:0	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you , and you will fall by the sword , inasmuch as you have turned back from following the Lord . And the Lord will not be with you . ”
4:14:044:0	But they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country ; neither the ark of the covenant of the Lord nor Moses left the camp .
4:14:045:0	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down , and struck them and beat them down as far as Hormah .
