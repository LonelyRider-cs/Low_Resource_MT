4:23:001:1	The Prophecies of Balaam
4:23:001:0	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Build seven altars for me here , and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here . ”
4:23:002:0	Balak did just as Balaam had spoken , and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar .
4:23:003:0	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Stand beside your burnt offering , and I will go ; perhaps the Lord will come to meet me , and whatever He shows me I will tell you . ” So he went to a bare hill .
4:23:004:0	Now God met Balaam , and he said to Him , “ I have set up the seven altars , and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar . ”
4:23:005:0	Then the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said , “ Return to Balak , and you shall speak thus . ”
4:23:006:0	So he returned to him , and behold , he was standing beside his burnt offering , he and all the leaders of Moab .
4:23:007:0	He took up his discourse and said , “ From Aram Balak has brought me , Moab’s king from the mountains of the East , ‘Come curse Jacob for me , And come , denounce Israel ! ’
4:23:008:0	How shall I curse whom God has not cursed ? And how can I denounce whom the Lord has not denounced ?
4:23:009:0	As I see him from the top of the rocks , And I look at him from the hills ; Behold , a people who dwells apart , And will not be reckoned among the nations .
4:23:010:0	Who can count the dust of Jacob , Or number the fourth part of Israel ? Let me die the death of the upright , And let my end be like his ! ”
4:23:011:0	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ What have you done to me ? I took you to curse my enemies , but behold , you have actually blessed them ! ”
4:23:012:0	He replied , “ Must I not be careful to speak what the Lord puts in my mouth ? ”
4:23:013:0	Then Balak said to him , “ Please come with me to another place from where you may see them , although you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them ; and curse them for me from there . ”
4:23:014:0	So he took him to the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
4:23:015:0	And he said to Balak , “ Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet the Lover there . ”
4:23:016:0	Then the Lord met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said , “ Return to Balak , and thus you shall speak . ”
4:23:017:0	He came to him , and behold , he was standing beside his burnt offering , and the leaders of Moab with him . And Balak said to him , “ What has the Lord spoken ? ”
4:23:018:0	Then he took up his discourse and said , “ Arise , O Balak , and hear ; Give ear to me , O son of Zippor !
4:23:019:0	God is not a man , that He should lie , Nor a son of man , that He should repent ; Has He said , and will He not do it ? Or has He spoken , and will He not make it good ?
4:23:020:0	Behold , I have received a command to bless ; When He has blessed , then I cannot revoke it .
4:23:021:0	He has not observed misfortune in Jacob ; Nor has He seen trouble in Israel ; The Lord his God is with him , And the shout of a king is among them .
4:23:022:0	God brings them out of Egypt , He is for them like the horns of the wild ox .
4:23:023:0	For there is no omen against Jacob , Nor is there any divination against Israel ; At the proper time it shall be said to JacobAnd to Israel , what God has done !
4:23:024:0	Behold , a people rises like a lioness , And as a lion it lifts itself ; It will not lie down until it devours the prey , And drinks the blood of the slain . ”
4:23:025:0	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all ! ”
4:23:026:0	But Balaam replied to Balak , “ Did I not tell you , ‘Whatever the Lord speaks , that I must do’ ? ”
4:23:027:0	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Please come , I will take you to another place ; perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there . ”
4:23:028:0	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland .
4:23:029:0	Balaam said to Balak , “ Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here . ”
4:23:030:0	Balak did just as Balaam had said , and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar .
