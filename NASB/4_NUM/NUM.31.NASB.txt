4:31:001:1	The Slaughter of Midian
4:31:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:31:002:0	“ Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites ; afterward you will be gathered to your people . ”
4:31:003:0	Moses spoke to the people , saying , “ Arm men from among you for the war , that they may go against Midian to execute the Lord’s vengeance on Midian .
4:31:004:0	A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war . ”
4:31:005:0	So there were furnished from the thousands of Israel , a thousand from each tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
4:31:006:0	Moses sent them , a thousand from each tribe , to the war , and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war with them , and the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand .
4:31:007:0	So they made war against Midian , just as the Lord had commanded Moses , and they killed every male .
4:31:008:0	They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain : Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba , the five kings of Midian ; they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword .
4:31:009:0	The sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their little ones ; and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they plundered .
4:31:010:0	Then they burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps with fire .
4:31:011:0	They took all the spoil and all the prey , both of man and of beast .
4:31:012:0	They brought the captives and the prey and the spoil to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho .
4:31:013:0	Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp .
4:31:014:0	Moses was angry with the officers of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , who had come from service in the war .
4:31:015:0	And Moses said to them , “ Have you spared all the women ?
4:31:016:0	Behold , these caused the sons of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor , so the plague was among the congregation of the Lord .
4:31:017:0	Now therefore , kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man intimately .
4:31:018:0	But all the girls who have not known man intimately , spare for yourselves .
4:31:019:0	And you , camp outside the camp seven days ; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain , purify yourselves , you and your captives , on the third day and on the seventh day .
4:31:020:0	You shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of leather and all the work of goats’ hair , and all articles of wood . ”
4:31:021:0	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle , “ This is the statute of the law which the Lord has commanded Moses :
4:31:022:0	only the gold and the silver , the bronze , the iron , the tin and the lead ,
4:31:023:0	everything that can stand the fire , you shall pass through the fire , and it shall be clean , but it shall be purified with water for impurity . But whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water .
4:31:002:1	Division of the Booty
4:31:024:0	And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean , and afterward you may enter the camp . ”
4:31:025:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:31:026:0	“ You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured , both of man and of animal ;
4:31:027:0	and divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation .
4:31:028:0	Levy a tax for the Lord from the men of war who went out to battle , one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep ;
4:31:029:0	take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest , as an offering to the Lord .
4:31:030:0	From the sons of Israel’s half , you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons , of the cattle , of the donkeys and of the sheep , from all the animals , and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the Lord . ”
4:31:031:0	Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:31:032:0	Now the booty that remained from the spoil which the men of war had plundered was 675 , 000 sheep ,
4:31:033:0	and 72 , 000 cattle ,
4:31:034:0	and 61 , 000 donkeys ,
4:31:035:0	and of human beings , of the women who had not known man intimately , all the persons were 32 , 000 .
4:31:036:0	The half , the portion of those who went out to war , was as follows : the number of sheep was 337 , 500 ,
4:31:037:0	and the Lord’s levy of the sheep was 675 ;
4:31:038:0	and the cattle were 36 , 000 , from which the Lord’s levy was 72 ;
4:31:039:0	and the donkeys were 30 , 500 , from which the Lord’s levy was 61 ;
4:31:040:0	and the human beings were 16 , 000 , from whom the Lord’s levy was 32 persons .
4:31:041:0	Moses gave the levy which was the Lord’s offering to Eleazar the priest , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:31:042:0	As for the sons of Israel’s half , which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war—
4:31:043:0	now the congregation’s half was 337 , 500 sheep ,
4:31:044:0	and 36 , 000 cattle ,
4:31:045:0	and 30 , 500 donkeys ,
4:31:046:0	and the human beings were 16 , 000—
4:31:047:0	and from the sons of Israel’s half , Moses took one drawn out of every fifty , both of man and of animals , and gave them to the Levites , who kept charge of the tabernacle of the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:31:048:0	Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , approached Moses ,
4:31:049:0	and they said to Moses , “ Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge , and no man of us is missing .
4:31:050:0	So we have brought as an offering to the Lord what each man found , articles of gold , armlets and bracelets , signet rings , earrings and necklaces , to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord . ”
4:31:051:0	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them , all kinds of wrought articles .
4:31:052:0	All the gold of the offering which they offered up to the Lord , from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , was 16 , 750 shekels .
4:31:053:0	The men of war had taken booty , every man for himself .
4:31:054:0	So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the Lord .
