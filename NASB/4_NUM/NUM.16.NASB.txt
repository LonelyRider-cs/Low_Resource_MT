4:16:001:1	Korah’s Rebellion
4:16:001:0	Now Korah the son of Izhar , the son of Kohath , the son of Levi , with Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , and On the son of Peleth , sons of Reuben , took action ,
4:16:002:0	and they rose up before Moses , together with some of the sons of Israel , two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation , chosen in the assembly , men of renown .
4:16:003:0	They assembled together against Moses and Aaron , and said to them , “ You have gone far enough , for all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the Lord is in their midst ; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord ? ”
4:16:004:0	When Moses heard this , he fell on his face ;
4:16:005:0	and he spoke to Korah and all his company , saying , “ Tomorrow morning the Lord will show who is His , and who is holy , and will bring him near to Himself ; even the one whom He will choose , He will bring near to Himself .
4:16:006:0	Do this : take censers for yourselves , Korah and all your company ,
4:16:007:0	and put fire in them , and lay incense upon them in the presence of the Lord tomorrow ; and the man whom the Lord chooses shall be the one who is holy . You have gone far enough , you sons of Levi ! ”
4:16:008:0	Then Moses said to Korah , “ Hear now , you sons of Levi ,
4:16:009:0	is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to Himself , to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord , and to stand before the congregation to minister to them ;
4:16:010:0	and that He has brought you near , Korah , and all your brothers , sons of Levi , with you ? And are you seeking for the priesthood also ?
4:16:011:0	Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the Lord ; but as for Aaron , who is he that you grumble against him ? ”
4:16:012:0	Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab ; but they said , “ We will not come up .
4:16:013:0	Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness , but you would also lord it over us ?
4:16:014:0	Indeed , you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards . Would you put out the eyes of these men ? We will not come up ! ”
4:16:015:0	Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord , “ Do not regard their offering ! I have not taken a single donkey from them , nor have I done harm to any of them . ”
4:16:016:0	Moses said to Korah , “ You and all your company be present before the Lord tomorrow , both you and they along with Aaron .
4:16:017:0	Each of you take his firepan and put incense on it , and each of you bring his censer before the Lord , two hundred and fifty firepans ; also you and Aaron shall each bring his firepan . ”
4:16:018:0	So they each took his own censer and put fire on it , and laid incense on it ; and they stood at the doorway of the tent of meeting , with Moses and Aaron .
4:16:019:0	Thus Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the doorway of the tent of meeting . And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation .
4:16:020:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
4:16:021:0	“ Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them instantly . ”
4:16:022:0	But they fell on their faces and said , “ O God , God of the spirits of all flesh , when one man sins , will You be angry with the entire congregation ? ”
4:16:023:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:16:024:0	“ Speak to the congregation , saying , ‘Get back from around the dwellings of Korah , Dathan and Abiram . ’ ”
4:16:025:0	Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram , with the elders of Israel following him ,
4:16:026:0	and he spoke to the congregation , saying , “ Depart now from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing that belongs to them , or you will be swept away in all their sin . ”
4:16:027:0	So they got back from around the dwellings of Korah , Dathan and Abiram ; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the doorway of their tents , along with their wives and their sons and their little ones .
4:16:028:0	Moses said , “ By this you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these deeds ; for this is not my doing .
4:16:029:0	If these men die the death of all men or if they suffer the fate of all men , then the Lord has not sent me .
4:16:030:0	But if the Lord brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs , and they descend alive into Sheol , then you will understand that these men have spurned the Lord . ”
4:16:031:0	As he finished speaking all these words , the ground that was under them split open ;
4:16:032:0	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions .
4:16:033:0	So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol ; and the earth closed over them , and they perished from the midst of the assembly .
4:16:034:0	All Israel who were around them fled at their outcry , for they said , “ The earth may swallow us up ! ”
4:16:035:0	Fire also came forth from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense .
4:16:036:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:16:037:0	“ Say to Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , that he shall take up the censers out of the midst of the blaze , for they are holy ; and you scatter the burning coals abroad .
4:16:038:0	As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives , let them be made into hammered sheets for a plating of the altar , since they did present them before the Lord and they are holy ; and they shall be for a sign to the sons of Israel . ”
4:16:039:0	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who were burned had offered , and they hammered them out as a plating for the altar ,
4:16:002:1	Murmuring and Plague
4:16:040:0	as a reminder to the sons of Israel that no layman who is not of the descendants of Aaron should come near to burn incense before the Lord ; so that he will not become like Korah and his company—just as the Lord had spoken to him through Moses .
4:16:041:0	But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron , saying , “ You are the ones who have caused the death of the Lord’s people . ”
4:16:042:0	It came about , however , when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron , that they turned toward the tent of meeting , and behold , the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared .
4:16:043:0	Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting ,
4:16:044:0	and the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
4:16:045:0	“ Get away from among this congregation , that I may consume them instantly . ” Then they fell on their faces .
4:16:046:0	Moses said to Aaron , “ Take your censer and put in it fire from the altar , and lay incense on it ; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them , for wrath has gone forth from the Lord , the plague has begun ! ”
4:16:047:0	Then Aaron took it as Moses had spoken , and ran into the midst of the assembly , for behold , the plague had begun among the people . So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people .
4:16:048:0	He took his stand between the dead and the living , so that the plague was checked .
4:16:049:0	But those who died by the plague were 14 , 700 , besides those who died on account of Korah .
4:16:050:0	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting , for the plague had been checked .
