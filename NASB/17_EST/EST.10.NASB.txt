17:10:001:1	Mordecai’s Greatness
17:10:001:0	Now King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea .
17:10:002:0	And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength , and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia ?
17:10:003:0	For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus , and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen , one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his whole nation .
