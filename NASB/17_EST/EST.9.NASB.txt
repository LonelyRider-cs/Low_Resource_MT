17:9:001:1	The Jews Destroy Their Enemies
17:9:001:0	Now in the twelfth month ( that is , the month Adar ) , on the thirteenth day when the king’s command and edict were about to be executed , on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them , it was turned to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained the mastery over those who hated them .
17:9:002:0	The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm ; and no one could stand before them , for the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples .
17:9:003:0	Even all the princes of the provinces , the satraps , the governors and those who were doing the king’s business assisted the Jews , because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them .
17:9:004:0	Indeed , Mordecai was great in the king’s house , and his fame spread throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater .
17:9:005:0	Thus the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword , killing and destroying ; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them .
17:9:006:0	At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men ,
17:9:007:0	and Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
17:9:008:0	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
17:9:009:0	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai and Vaizatha ,
17:9:010:0	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Jews’ enemy ; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder .
17:9:011:0	On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa was reported to the king .
17:9:012:0	The king said to Queen Esther , “ The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa . What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces ! Now what is your petition ? It shall even be granted you . And what is your further request ? It shall also be done . ”
17:9:013:0	Then said Esther , “ If it pleases the king , let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today ; and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows . ”
17:9:014:0	So the king commanded that it should be done so ; and an edict was issued in Susa , and Haman’s ten sons were hanged .
17:9:015:0	The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa , but they did not lay their hands on the plunder .
17:9:016:0	Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces assembled , to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies , and kill 75 , 000 of those who hated them ; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder .
17:9:017:0	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar , and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing .
17:9:018:0	But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month , and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing .
17:9:002:1	The Feast of Purim Instituted
17:9:019:0	Therefore the Jews of the rural areas , who live in the rural towns , make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions of food to one another .
17:9:020:0	Then Mordecai recorded these events , and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus , both near and far ,
17:9:021:0	obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same month , annually ,
17:9:022:0	because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies , and it was a month which was turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday ; that they should make them days of feasting and rejoicing and sending portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor .
17:9:023:0	Thus the Jews undertook what they had started to do , and what Mordecai had written to them .
17:9:024:0	For Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the adversary of all the Jews , had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur , that is the lot , to disturb them and destroy them .
17:9:025:0	But when it came to the king’s attention , he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews , should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
17:9:026:0	Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur . And because of the instructions in this letter , both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them ,
17:9:027:0	the Jews established and made a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all those who allied themselves with them , so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually .
17:9:028:0	So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation , every family , every province and every city ; and these days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews , or their memory fade from their descendants .
17:9:029:0	Then Queen Esther , daughter of Abihail , with Mordecai the Jew , wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim .
17:9:030:0	He sent letters to all the Jews , to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , namely , words of peace and truth ,
17:9:031:0	to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times , just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them , and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and their lamentations .
17:9:032:0	The command of Esther established these customs for Purim , and it was written in the book .
