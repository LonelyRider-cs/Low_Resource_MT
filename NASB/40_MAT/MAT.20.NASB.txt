40:20:001:1	Laborers in the Vineyard
40:20:001:0	“ For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
40:20:002:0	When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40:20:003:0	And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place ;
40:20:004:0	and to those he said , ‘You also go into the vineyard , and whatever is right I will give you . ’ And they went .
40:20:005:0	Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did the same thing .
40:20:006:0	And about the eleventh he went out and found others standing and he *said to them , ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day long ? ’
40:20:007:0	They *said to him , ‘Because no one hired us . ’ He *said to them , ‘You go into the vineyard too . ’
40:20:008:0	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman , ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last to the first . ’
40:20:009:0	When those about the eleventh hour came , each one received a denarius .
40:20:010:0	When those first came , they thought that they would receive more ; but each of them also received a denarius .
40:20:011:0	When they received it , they grumbled at the landowner ,
40:20:012:0	saying , ‘These last men have worked one hour , and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day . ’
40:20:013:0	But he answered and said to one of them , ‘Friend , I am doing you no wrong ; did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
40:20:014:0	Take what is yours and go , but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you .
40:20:015:0	Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own ? Or is your eye envious because I am generous ? ’
40:20:002:1	Death , Resurrection Foretold
40:20:016:0	So the last shall be first , and the first last . ”
40:20:017:0	As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem , He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves , and on the way He said to them ,
40:20:018:0	“ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn Him to death ,
40:20:003:1	Preferment Asked
40:20:019:0	and will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify and on the third day He will be raised up . ”
40:20:020:0	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons , bowing down and making a request of Him .
40:20:021:0	And He said to her , “ What do you wish ? ” She *said to Him , “ Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left . ”
40:20:022:0	But Jesus answered , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink ? ” They *said to Him , “ We are able . ”
40:20:023:0	He *said to them , “ My cup you shall drink ; but to sit on My right and on left , this is not Mine to give , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father . ”
40:20:024:0	And hearing this , the ten became indignant with the two brothers .
40:20:025:0	But Jesus called them to Himself and said , “ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and great men exercise authority over them .
40:20:026:0	It is not this way among you , but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant ,
40:20:027:0	and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave ;
40:20:004:1	Sight for the Blind
40:20:028:0	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life a ransom for many . ”
40:20:029:0	As they were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed Him .
40:20:030:0	And two blind men sitting by the road , hearing that Jesus was passing by , cried out , “ Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40:20:031:0	The crowd sternly told them to be quiet , but they cried out all the more , “ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ”
40:20:032:0	And Jesus stopped and called them , and said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
40:20:033:0	They *said to Him , “ Lord , we want our eyes to be opened . ”
40:20:034:0	Moved with compassion , Jesus touched their eyes ; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him .
