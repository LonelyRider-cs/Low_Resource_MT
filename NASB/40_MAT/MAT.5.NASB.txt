40:5:001:1	The Sermon on the Mount ; The Beatitudes
40:5:001:0	When Jesus saw the crowds , He went up on the mountain ; and after He sat down , His disciples came to Him .
40:5:002:0	He opened His mouth and began to teach them , saying ,
40:5:003:0	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40:5:004:0	“ Blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted .
40:5:005:0	“ Blessed are the gentle , for they shall inherit the earth .
40:5:006:0	“ Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness , for they shall be satisfied .
40:5:007:0	“ Blessed are the merciful , for they shall receive mercy .
40:5:008:0	“ Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
40:5:009:0	“ Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God .
40:5:010:0	“ Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40:5:011:0	“ Blessed are you when insult you and persecute you , and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me .
40:5:002:1	Disciples and the World
40:5:012:0	Rejoice and be glad , for your reward in heaven is great ; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40:5:013:0	“ You are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt has become tasteless , how can it be made salty It is no longer good for anything , except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men .
40:5:014:0	“ You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill cannot be hidden ;
40:5:015:0	nor does light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on the lampstand , and it gives light to all who are in the house .
40:5:016:0	Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
40:5:017:0	“ Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill .
40:5:018:0	For truly I say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished .
40:5:019:0	Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments , and teaches others the same , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but whoever keeps and teaches he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40:5:003:1	Personal Relationships
40:5:020:0	“ For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses of the scribes and Pharisees , you will not enter the kingdom of heaven .
40:5:021:0	“ You have heard that the ancients were told , ‘Y’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court . ’
40:5:022:0	But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court ; and whoever says to his brother , ‘You good-for-nothing , ’ shall be guilty before the supreme court ; and whoever says , ‘You fool , ’ shall be guilty into the fiery hell .
40:5:023:0	Therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar , and there remember that your brother has something against you ,
40:5:024:0	leave your offering there before the altar and go ; first be reconciled to your brother , and then come and present your offering .
40:5:025:0	Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way , so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge , and the judge to the officer , and you be thrown into prison .
40:5:026:0	Truly I say to you , you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent .
40:5:027:0	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘Y’ ;
40:5:028:0	but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40:5:029:0	If your right eye makes you stumble , tear it out and throw it from you ; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body , than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40:5:030:0	If your right hand makes you stumble , cut it off and throw it from you ; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body , than for your whole body to go into hell .
40:5:031:0	“ It was said , ‘W , ’ ;
40:5:032:0	but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife , except for reason of unchastity , makes her commit adultery ; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40:5:033:0	“ Again , you have heard that the ancients were told , ‘Y , L . ’
40:5:034:0	But I say to you , make no oath at all , either by heaven , for it is the throne of God ,
40:5:035:0	or by the earth , for it is the footstool of His feet , or by Jerusalem , for it is K .
40:5:036:0	Nor shall you make an oath by your head , for you cannot make one hair white or black .
40:5:037:0	But let your statement be , ‘Yes , yes’ ‘No , no’ ; anything beyond these is of evil .
40:5:038:0	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘A , . ’
40:5:039:0	But I say to you , do not resist an evil person ; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek , turn the other to him also .
40:5:040:0	If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt , let him have your coat also .
40:5:041:0	Whoever forces you to go one mile , go with him two .
40:5:042:0	Give to him who asks of you , and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you .
40:5:043:0	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘Y and hate your enemy . ’
40:5:044:0	But I say to you , love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40:5:045:0	so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven ; for He causes His sun to rise on evil and good , and sends rain on righteous and unrighteous .
40:5:046:0	For if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Do not even the tax collectors do the same ?
40:5:047:0	If you greet only your brothers , what more are you doing Do not even the Gentiles do the same ?
40:5:048:0	Therefore you are to be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect .
