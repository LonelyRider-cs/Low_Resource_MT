40:25:001:1	Parable of Ten Virgins
40:25:001:0	“ Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins , who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40:25:002:0	Five of them were foolish , and five were prudent .
40:25:003:0	For when the foolish took their lamps , they took no oil with them ,
40:25:004:0	but the prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps .
40:25:005:0	Now while the bridegroom was delaying , they all got drowsy and to sleep .
40:25:006:0	But at midnight there was a shout , ‘Behold , the bridegroom ! Come out to meet ’
40:25:007:0	Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps .
40:25:008:0	The foolish said to the prudent , ‘Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . ’
40:25:009:0	But the prudent answered , ‘No , there will not be enough for us and you go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves . ’
40:25:010:0	And while they were going away to make the purchase , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast ; and the door was shut .
40:25:011:0	Later the other virgins also came , saying , ‘Lord , lord , open up for us . ’
40:25:012:0	But he answered , ‘Truly I say to you , I do not know you . ’
40:25:002:1	Parable of the Talents
40:25:013:0	Be on the alert then , for you do not know the day nor the hour .
40:25:014:0	“ For just like a man to go on a journey , who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them .
40:25:015:0	To one he gave five talents , to another , two , and to another , one , each according to his own ability ; and he went on his journey .
40:25:016:0	Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them , and gained five more talents .
40:25:017:0	In the same manner the one who the two gained two more .
40:25:018:0	But he who received the one went away , and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money .
40:25:019:0	“ Now after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them .
40:25:020:0	The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents , saying , ‘Master , you entrusted five talents to me . See , I have gained five more talents . ’
40:25:021:0	His master said to him , ‘Well done , good and faithful slave . You were faithful with a few things , I will put you in charge of many things ; enter into the joy of your master . ’
40:25:022:0	“ Also the one who the two talents came up and said , ‘Master , you entrusted two talents to me . See , I have gained two more talents . ’
40:25:023:0	His master said to him , ‘Well done , good and faithful slave . You were faithful with a few things , I will put you in charge of many things ; enter into the joy of your master . ’
40:25:024:0	“ And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said , ‘Master , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no
40:25:025:0	And I was afraid , and went away and hid your talent in the ground . See , you have what is yours . ’
40:25:026:0	“ But his master answered and said to him , ‘You wicked , lazy slave , you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no
40:25:027:0	Then you ought to have put my money in the bank , and on my arrival I would have received my back with interest .
40:25:028:0	Therefore take away the talent from him , and give it to the one who has the ten talents . ’
40:25:029:0	“ For to everyone who has , shall be given , and he will have an abundance ; but from the one who does not have , even what he does have shall be taken away .
40:25:003:1	The Judgment
40:25:030:0	Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:25:031:0	“ But when the Son of Man comes in His glory , and all the angels with Him , then He will sit on His glorious throne .
40:25:032:0	All the nations will be gathered before Him ; and He will separate them from one another , as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats ;
40:25:033:0	and He will put the sheep on His right , and the goats on the left .
40:25:034:0	“ Then the King will say to those on His right , ‘Come , you who are blessed of My Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40:25:035:0	For I was hungry , and you gave Me to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave Me to drink ; I was a stranger , and you invited Me in ;
40:25:036:0	naked , and you clothed Me ; I was sick , and you visited Me ; I was in prison , and you came to Me . ’
40:25:037:0	Then the righteous will answer Him , ‘Lord , when did we see You hungry , and feed You , or thirsty , and give You to drink ?
40:25:038:0	And when did we see You a stranger , and invite You in , or naked , and clothe You ?
40:25:039:0	When did we see You sick , or in prison , and come to You ? ’
40:25:040:0	The King will answer and say to them , ‘Truly I say to you , to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine , the least you did it to Me . ’
40:25:041:0	“ Then He will also say to those on His left , ‘Depart from Me , accursed ones , into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels ;
40:25:042:0	for I was hungry , and you gave Me to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave Me nothing to drink ;
40:25:043:0	I was a stranger , and you did not invite Me in ; naked , and you did not clothe Me ; sick , and in prison , and you did not visit Me . ’
40:25:044:0	Then they themselves also will answer , ‘Lord , when did we see You hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not take care of You ? ’
40:25:045:0	Then He will answer them , ‘Truly I say to you , to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these , you did not do it to Me . ’
40:25:046:0	These will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . ”
