40:22:001:1	Parable of the Marriage Feast
40:22:001:0	Jesus spoke to them again in parables , saying ,
40:22:002:0	“ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son .
40:22:003:0	And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast , and they were unwilling to come .
40:22:004:0	Again he sent out other slaves saying , ‘Tell those who have been invited , “ Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and my fattened livestock are butchered and everything is ready ; come to the wedding feast . ” ’
40:22:005:0	But they paid no attention and went their way , one to his own farm , another to his business ,
40:22:006:0	and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them .
40:22:007:0	But the king was enraged , and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire .
40:22:008:0	Then he *said to his slaves , ‘The wedding is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
40:22:009:0	Go therefore to the main highways , and as many as you find invite to the wedding feast . ’
40:22:010:0	Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found , both evil and good ; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests .
40:22:011:0	“ But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests , he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes ,
40:22:012:0	and he *said to him , ‘Friend , how did you come in here without wedding clothes ? ’ And the man was speechless .
40:22:013:0	Then the king said to the servants , ‘Bind him hand and foot , and throw him into the outer darkness ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40:22:002:1	Tribute to Caesar
40:22:014:0	For many are called , but few chosen . ”
40:22:015:0	Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said .
40:22:016:0	And they *sent their disciples to Him , along with the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth , and defer to no one ; for You are not partial to any .
40:22:017:0	Tell us then , what do You think ? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar , or not ? ”
40:22:018:0	But Jesus perceived their malice , and said , “ Why are you testing Me , you hypocrites ?
40:22:019:0	Show Me the coin for the poll-tax . ” And they brought Him a denarius .
40:22:020:0	And He *said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ”
40:22:021:0	They *said to Him , “ Caesar’s . ” Then He *said to them , “ Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s ; and to God the things that are God’s . ”
40:22:003:1	Jesus Answers the Sadducees
40:22:022:0	And hearing this , they were amazed , and leaving Him , they went away .
40:22:023:0	On that day some Sadducees ( who say there is no resurrection ) came to Jesus and questioned Him ,
40:22:024:0	asking , “ Teacher , Moses said , ‘If a man dies having no children , his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife , and raise up children for his brother . ’
40:22:025:0	Now there were seven brothers with us ; and the first married and died , and having no children left his wife to his brother ;
40:22:026:0	so also the second , and the third , down to the seventh .
40:22:027:0	Last of all , the woman died .
40:22:028:0	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had married her . ”
40:22:029:0	But Jesus answered and said to them , “ You are mistaken , not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God .
40:22:030:0	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
40:22:031:0	But regarding the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by God :
40:22:032:0	‘I G A , G I , G J’ ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living . ”
40:22:033:0	When the crowds heard this , they were astonished at His teaching .
40:22:034:0	But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered themselves together .
40:22:035:0	One of them , a lawyer , asked Him a question , testing Him ,
40:22:036:0	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the Law ? ”
40:22:037:0	And He said to him , “ ‘Y L G , , . ’
40:22:038:0	This is the great and foremost commandment .
40:22:039:0	The second is like it , ‘Y . ’
40:22:040:0	On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets . ”
40:22:041:0	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question :
40:22:042:0	“ What do you think about the Christ , whose son is He ? ” They *said to Him , “ The son of David . ”
40:22:043:0	He *said to them , “ Then how does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord , ’ saying ,
40:22:044:0	‘T L L , “ S M , U I Y Y ” ’ ?
40:22:045:0	If David then calls Him ‘Lord , ’ how is He his son ? ”
40:22:046:0	No one was able to answer Him a word , nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question .
