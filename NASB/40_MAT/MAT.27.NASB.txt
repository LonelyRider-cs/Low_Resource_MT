40:27:001:1	Judas’s Remorse
40:27:001:0	Now when morning came , all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus to put Him to death ;
40:27:002:0	and they bound Him , and led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor .
40:27:003:0	Then when Judas , who had betrayed Him , saw that He had been condemned , he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
40:27:004:0	saying , “ I have sinned by betraying innocent blood . ” But they said , “ What is that to us ? See to that yourself ! ”
40:27:005:0	And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed ; and he went away and hanged himself .
40:27:006:0	The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said , “ It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury , since it is the price of blood . ”
40:27:007:0	And they conferred together and with the money bought the Potter’s Field as a burial place for strangers .
40:27:008:0	For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
40:27:009:0	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled : “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of the one whose price had been set by the sons of Israel ;
40:27:002:1	Jesus before Pilate
40:27:010:0	and they gave them for the Potter’s Field , as the Lord directed me . ”
40:27:011:0	Now Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor questioned Him , saying , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” And Jesus said to him , “ you say . ”
40:27:012:0	And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders , He did not answer .
40:27:013:0	Then Pilate *said to Him , “ Do You not hear how many things they testify against You ? ”
40:27:014:0	And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge , so the governor was quite amazed .
40:27:015:0	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people any one prisoner whom they wanted .
40:27:016:0	At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner , called Barabbas .
40:27:017:0	So when the people gathered together , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you ? Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
40:27:018:0	For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over .
40:27:019:0	While he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent him a message , saying , “ Have nothing to do with that righteous Man ; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him . ”
40:27:020:0	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death .
40:27:021:0	But the governor said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas . ”
40:27:022:0	Pilate *said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ” They all *said , “ Crucify Him ! ”
40:27:023:0	And he said , “ Why , what evil has He done ? ” But they kept shouting all the more , saying , “ Crucify Him ! ”
40:27:024:0	When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing , but rather that a riot was starting , he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of this Man’s blood ; see to that yourselves . ”
40:27:025:0	And all the people said , “ His blood shall be on us and on our children ! ”
40:27:003:1	Jesus Is Mocked
40:27:026:0	Then he released Barabbas for them ; but after having Jesus scourged , he handed Him over to be crucified .
40:27:027:0	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him .
40:27:028:0	They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him .
40:27:029:0	And after twisting together a crown of thorns , they put it on His head , and a reed in His right hand ; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
40:27:030:0	They spat on Him , and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head .
40:27:031:0	After they had mocked Him , they took the scarlet robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him , and led Him away to crucify Him .
40:27:004:1	The Crucifixion
40:27:032:0	As they were coming out , they found a man of Cyrene named Simon , whom they pressed into service to bear His cross .
40:27:033:0	And when they came to a place called Golgotha , which means Place of a Skull ,
40:27:034:0	they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall ; and after tasting it , He was unwilling to drink .
40:27:035:0	And when they had crucified Him , they divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots .
40:27:036:0	And sitting down , they began to keep watch over Him there .
40:27:037:0	And above His head they put up the charge against Him which read , “ THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS . ”
40:27:038:0	At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him , one on the right and one on the left .
40:27:039:0	And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him , wagging their heads
40:27:040:0	and saying , “ You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save Yourself ! If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross . ”
40:27:041:0	In the same way the chief priests also , along with the scribes and elders , were mocking Him and saying ,
40:27:042:0	“ He saved others ; He cannot save Himself . He is the King of Israel ; let Him now come down from the cross , and we will believe in Him .
40:27:043:0	He trusts in God ; let God rescue Him now , if He delights in Him ; for He said , ‘I am the Son of God . ’ ”
40:27:044:0	The robbers who had been crucified with Him were also insulting Him with the same words .
40:27:045:0	Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour .
40:27:046:0	About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ E , E , ? ” that is , “ M G , M G , Y M ? ”
40:27:047:0	And some of those who were standing there , when they heard it , began saying , “ This man is calling for Elijah . ”
40:27:048:0	Immediately one of them ran , and taking a sponge , he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed , and gave Him a drink .
40:27:049:0	But the rest of them said , “ Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him . ”
40:27:050:0	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice , and yielded up His spirit .
40:27:051:0	And behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom ; and the earth shook and the rocks were split .
40:27:052:0	The tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ;
40:27:053:0	and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many .
40:27:054:0	Now the centurion , and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus , when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening , became very frightened and said , “ Truly this was the Son of God ! ”
40:27:055:0	Many women were there looking on from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to Him .
40:27:005:1	Jesus Is Buried
40:27:056:0	Among them was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40:27:057:0	When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus .
40:27:058:0	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
40:27:059:0	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
40:27:060:0	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock ; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away .
40:27:061:0	And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the grave .
40:27:062:0	Now on the next day , the day after the preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate ,
40:27:063:0	and said , “ Sir , we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said , ‘After three days I am to rise again . ’
40:27:064:0	Therefore , give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day , otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people , ‘He has risen from the dead , ’ and the last deception will be worse than the first . ”
40:27:065:0	Pilate said to them , “ You have a guard ; go , make it as secure as you know how . ”
40:27:066:0	And they went and made the grave secure , and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone .
