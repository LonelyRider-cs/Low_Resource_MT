40:3:001:1	The Preaching of John the Baptist
40:3:001:0	Now in those days John the Baptist *came , preaching in the wilderness of Judea , saying ,
40:3:002:0	“ Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . ”
40:3:003:0	For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘Make ready the way of the Lord , Make His paths straight ! ’ ”
40:3:004:0	Now John himself had a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist ; and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40:3:005:0	Then Jerusalem was going out to him , and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan ;
40:3:006:0	and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River , as they confessed their sins .
40:3:007:0	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism , he said to them , “ You brood of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
40:3:008:0	Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance ;
40:3:009:0	and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves , ‘We have Abraham for our father’ ; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham .
40:3:010:0	The axe is already laid at the root of the trees ; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40:3:011:0	“ As for me , I baptize you with water for repentance , but He who is coming after me is mightier than I , and I am not fit to remove His sandals ; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
40:3:002:1	The Baptism of Jesus
40:3:012:0	His winnowing fork is in His hand , and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor ; and He will gather His wheat into the barn , but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire . ”
40:3:013:0	Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John , to be baptized by him .
40:3:014:0	But John tried to prevent Him , saying , “ I have need to be baptized by You , and do You come to me ? ”
40:3:015:0	But Jesus answering said to him , “ Permit at this time ; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness . ” Then he *permitted Him .
40:3:016:0	After being baptized , Jesus came up immediately from the water ; and behold , the heavens were opened , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him ,
40:3:017:0	and behold , a voice out of the heavens said , “ This is My beloved Son , in whom I am well-pleased . ”
