40:12:001:0	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath , and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat .
40:12:002:0	But when the Pharisees saw this , they said to Him , “ Look , Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath . ”
40:12:003:0	But He said to them , “ Have you not read what David did when he became hungry , he and his companions ,
40:12:004:0	how he entered the house of God , and they ate the consecrated bread , which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him , but for the priests alone ?
40:12:005:0	Or have you not read in the Law , that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent ?

40:12:009:0	Departing from there , He went into their synagogue .
40:12:010:0	And a man was there whose hand was withered . And they questioned Jesus , asking , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” —so that they might accuse Him .
40:12:011:0	And He said to them , “ What man is there among you who has a sheep , and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will he not take hold of it and lift it out ?
40:12:012:0	How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep ! So then , it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath . ”

40:12:015:0	But Jesus , aware of this , withdrew from there . Many followed Him , and He healed them all ,
40:12:016:0	and warned them not to tell who He was .

40:12:018:0	“ Behold , My Servant whom I have chosen ; My Beloved in whom My soul is well-pleased ; I will put My Spirit upon Him , And He shall proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
40:12:019:0	He will not quarrel , nor cry out ; Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets .

40:12:024:0	But when the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons . ”
40:12:025:0	And knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them , “ Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste ; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand .
40:12:026:0	If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then will his kingdom stand ?
40:12:027:0	If I by Beelzebul cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast out ? For this reason they will be your judges .
40:12:028:0	But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .

40:12:035:0	The good man brings out of good treasure what is good ; and the evil man brings out of evil treasure what is evil .

40:12:006:1	The Desire for Signs
40:12:037:0	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . ”
40:12:038:0	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from You . ”
40:12:039:0	But He answered and said to them , “ An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign ; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet ;
40:12:040:0	for just as J , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .

40:12:046:0	While He was still speaking to the crowds , behold , His mother and brothers were standing outside , seeking to speak to Him .
40:12:047:0	Someone said to Him , “ Behold , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You . ”
40:12:048:0	But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said , “ Who is My mother and who are My brothers ? ”
40:12:049:0	And stretching out His hand toward His disciples , He said , “ Behold My mother and My brothers !
40:12:050:0	For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven , he is My brother and sister and mother . ”
