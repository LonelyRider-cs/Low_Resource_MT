40:9:001:1	A Paralytic Healed
40:9:001:0	Getting into a boat , Jesus crossed over the sea and came to His own city .
40:9:002:0	And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed . Seeing their faith , Jesus said to the paralytic , “ Take courage , son ; your sins are forgiven . ”
40:9:003:0	And some of the scribes said to themselves , “ This fellow blasphemes . ”
40:9:004:0	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , “ Why are you thinking evil in your hearts ?
40:9:005:0	Which is easier , to say , ‘Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘Get up , and walk’ ?
40:9:006:0	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —then He *said to the paralytic , “ Get up , pick up your bed and go home . ”
40:9:007:0	And he got up and went home .
40:9:002:1	Matthew Called
40:9:008:0	But when the crowds saw this , they were awestruck , and glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
40:9:009:0	As Jesus went on from there , He saw a man called Matthew , sitting in the tax collector’s booth ; and He *said to him , “ Follow Me ! ” And he got up and followed Him .
40:9:010:0	Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples .
40:9:011:0	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to His disciples , “ Why is your Teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners ? ”
40:9:012:0	But when Jesus heard this , He said , “ not those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick .
40:9:003:1	The Question about Fasting
40:9:013:0	But go and learn what this means : ‘I , , ’ for I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners . ”
40:9:014:0	Then the disciples of John *came to Him , asking , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
40:9:015:0	And Jesus said to them , “ The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them , can they ? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40:9:016:0	But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; for the patch pulls away from the garment , and a worse tear results .
40:9:004:1	Miracles of Healing
40:9:017:0	Nor do put new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the wineskins burst , and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined ; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved . ”
40:9:018:0	While He was saying these things to them , a synagogue official came and bowed down before Him , and said , “ My daughter has just died ; but come and lay Your hand on her , and she will live . ”
40:9:019:0	Jesus got up and began to follow him , and so did His disciples .
40:9:020:0	And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years , came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak ;
40:9:021:0	for she was saying to herself , “ If I only touch His garment , I will get well . ”
40:9:022:0	But Jesus turning and seeing her said , “ Daughter , take courage ; your faith has made you well . ” At once the woman was made well .
40:9:023:0	When Jesus came into the official’s house , and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder ,
40:9:024:0	He said , “ Leave ; for the girl has not died , but is asleep . ” And they began laughing at Him .
40:9:025:0	But when the crowd had been sent out , He entered and took her by the hand , and the girl got up .
40:9:026:0	This news spread throughout all that land .
40:9:027:0	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed Him , crying out , “ Have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40:9:028:0	When He entered the house , the blind men came up to Him , and Jesus *said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” They *said to Him , “ Yes , Lord . ”
40:9:029:0	Then He touched their eyes , saying , “ It shall be done to you according to your faith . ”
40:9:030:0	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus sternly warned them : “ See that no one knows ”
40:9:031:0	But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout all that land .
40:9:032:0	As they were going out , a mute , demon-possessed man was brought to Him .
40:9:033:0	After the demon was cast out , the mute man spoke ; and the crowds were amazed , and were saying , “ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel . ”
40:9:034:0	But the Pharisees were saying , “ He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons . ”
40:9:035:0	Jesus was going through all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness .
40:9:036:0	Seeing the people , He felt compassion for them , because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd .
40:9:037:0	Then He *said to His disciples , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the workers are few .
40:9:038:0	Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest . ”
