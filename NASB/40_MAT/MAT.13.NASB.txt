40:13:001:1	Jesus Teaches in Parables
40:13:001:0	That day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea .
40:13:002:0	And large crowds gathered to Him , so He got into a boat and sat down , and the whole crowd was standing on the beach .
40:13:003:0	And He spoke many things to them in parables , saying , “ Behold , the sower went out to sow ;
40:13:004:0	and as he sowed , some fell beside the road , and the birds came and ate them up .
40:13:005:0	Others fell on the rocky places , where they did not have much soil ; and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of soil .
40:13:006:0	But when the sun had risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
40:13:007:0	Others fell among the thorns , and the thorns came up and choked them out .
40:13:008:0	And others fell on the good soil and *yielded a crop , some a hundredfold , some sixty , and some thirty .
40:13:002:1	An Explanation
40:13:009:0	He who has ears , let him hear . ”
40:13:010:0	And the disciples came and said to Him , “ Why do You speak to them in parables ? ”
40:13:011:0	Jesus answered them , “ To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been granted .
40:13:012:0	For whoever has , to him shall be given , and he will have an abundance ; but whoever does not have , even what he has shall be taken away from him .
40:13:013:0	Therefore I speak to them in parables ; because while seeing they do not see , and while hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
40:13:014:0	In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled , which says , ‘Y , ; Y , ;
40:13:015:0	F , W , A , O , H , A , A I . ’
40:13:016:0	But blessed are your eyes , because they see ; and your ears , because they hear .
40:13:003:1	The Sower Explained
40:13:017:0	For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see , and did not see and to hear what you hear , and did not hear
40:13:018:0	“ Hear then the parable of the sower .
40:13:019:0	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart . This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road .
40:13:020:0	The one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places , this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ;
40:13:021:0	yet he has no root in himself , but is temporary , and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he falls away .
40:13:022:0	And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns , this is the man who hears the word , and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
40:13:004:1	Tares among Wheat
40:13:023:0	And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil , this is the man who hears the word and understands it ; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth , some a hundredfold , some sixty , and some thirty . ”
40:13:024:0	Jesus presented another parable to them , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field .
40:13:025:0	But while his men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went away .
40:13:026:0	But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain , then the tares became evident also .
40:13:027:0	The slaves of the landowner came and said to him , ‘Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How then does it have tares ? ’
40:13:028:0	And he said to them , ‘An enemy has done this ! ’ The slaves *said to him , ‘Do you want us , then , to go and gather them up ? ’
40:13:029:0	But he *said , ‘No ; for while you are gathering up the tares , you may uproot the wheat with them .
40:13:005:1	The Mustard Seed
40:13:030:0	Allow both to grow together until the harvest ; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , “ First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up ; but gather the wheat into my barn . ” ’ ”
40:13:031:0	He presented another parable to them , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ;
40:13:006:1	The Leaven
40:13:032:0	and this is smaller than all seeds , but when it is full grown , it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree , so that come and . ”
40:13:033:0	He spoke another parable to them , “ The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until it was all leavened . ”
40:13:034:0	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables , and He did not speak to them without a parable .
40:13:007:1	The Tares Explained
40:13:035:0	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet : “ I will open My mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world . ”
40:13:036:0	Then He left the crowds and went into the house . And His disciples came to Him and said , “ Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field . ”
40:13:037:0	And He said , “ The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ,
40:13:038:0	and the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the tares are the sons of the evil
40:13:039:0	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is the end of the age ; and the reapers are angels .
40:13:040:0	So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire , so shall it be at the end of the age .
40:13:041:0	The Son of Man will send forth His angels , and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks , and those who commit lawlessness ,
40:13:042:0	and will throw them into the furnace of fire ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:13:008:1	Hidden Treasure
40:13:043:0	Then in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears , let him hear .
40:13:009:1	A Costly Pearl
40:13:044:0	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found and hid and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field .
40:13:045:0	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls ,
40:13:010:1	A Dragnet
40:13:046:0	and upon finding one pearl of great value , he went and sold all that he had and bought it .
40:13:047:0	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea , and gathering of every kind ;
40:13:048:0	and when it was filled , they drew it up on the beach ; and they sat down and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
40:13:049:0	So it will be at the end of the age ; the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous ,
40:13:050:0	and will throw them into the furnace of fire ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:13:051:0	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” They *said to Him , “ Yes . ”
40:13:011:1	Jesus Revisits Nazareth
40:13:052:0	And Jesus said to them , “ Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household , who brings out of his treasure things new and old . ”
40:13:053:0	When Jesus had finished these parables , He departed from there .
40:13:054:0	He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , “ Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers ?
40:13:055:0	Is not this the carpenter’s son ? Is not His mother called Mary , and His brothers , James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
40:13:056:0	And His sisters , are they not all with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? ”
40:13:057:0	And they took offense at Him . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his household . ”
40:13:058:0	And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief .
