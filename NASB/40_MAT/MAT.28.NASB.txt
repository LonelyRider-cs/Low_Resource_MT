40:28:001:1	Jesus Is Risen !
40:28:001:0	Now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave .
40:28:002:0	And behold , a severe earthquake had occurred , for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it .
40:28:003:0	And his appearance was like lightning , and his clothing as white as snow .
40:28:004:0	The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men .
40:28:005:0	The angel said to the women , “ Do not be afraid ; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified .
40:28:006:0	He is not here , for He has risen , just as He said . Come , see the place where He was lying .
40:28:007:0	Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead ; and behold , He is going ahead of you into Galilee , there you will see Him ; behold , I have told you . ”
40:28:008:0	And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples .
40:28:009:0	And behold , Jesus met them and greeted them . And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him .
40:28:010:0	Then Jesus *said to them , “ Do not be afraid ; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee , and there they will see Me . ”
40:28:011:0	Now while they were on their way , some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened .
40:28:012:0	And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
40:28:013:0	and said , “ You are to say , ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep . ’
40:28:014:0	And if this should come to the governor’s ears , we will win him over and keep you out of trouble . ”
40:28:002:1	The Great Commission
40:28:015:0	And they took the money and did as they had been instructed ; and this story was widely spread among the Jews , and is to this day .
40:28:016:0	But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee , to the mountain which Jesus had designated .
40:28:017:0	When they saw Him , they worshiped Him ; but some were doubtful .
40:28:018:0	And Jesus came up and spoke to them , saying , “ All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth .
40:28:019:0	Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit ,
40:28:020:0	teaching them to observe all that I commanded you ; and lo , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . ”
