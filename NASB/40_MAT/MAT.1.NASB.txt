40:1:018:0	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows : when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit .
40:1:019:0	And Joseph her husband , being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her , planned to send her away secretly .
40:1:020:0	But when he had considered this , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , “ Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife ; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
40:1:021:0	She will bear a Son ; and you shall call His name Jesus , for He will save His people from their sins . ”
40:1:022:0	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet :
40:1:023:0	“ Behold , the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a Son , and they shall call His name Immanuel , ” which translated means , “ God with us . ”
40:1:024:0	And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took Mary as his wife ,
40:1:025:0	but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son ; and he called His name Jesus .
