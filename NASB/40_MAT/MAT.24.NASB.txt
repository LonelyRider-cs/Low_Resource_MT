40:24:001:1	Signs of Christ’s Return
40:24:001:0	Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him .
40:24:002:0	And He said to them , “ Do you not see all these things ? Truly I say to you , not one stone here will be left upon another , which will not be torn down . ”
40:24:003:0	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to Him privately , saying , “ Tell us , when will these things happen , and what will be the sign of Your coming , and of the end of the age ? ”
40:24:004:0	And Jesus answered and said to them , “ See to it that no one misleads you .
40:24:005:0	For many will come in My name , saying , ‘I am the Christ , ’ and will mislead many .
40:24:006:0	You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars . See that you are not frightened , for must take place , but is not yet the end .
40:24:007:0	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes .
40:24:008:0	But all these things are the beginning of birth pangs .
40:24:009:0	“ Then they will deliver you to tribulation , and will kill you , and you will be hated by all nations because of My name .
40:24:010:0	At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another .
40:24:011:0	Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many .
40:24:012:0	Because lawlessness is increased , most people’s love will grow cold .
40:24:013:0	But the one who endures to the end , he will be saved .
40:24:002:1	Perilous Times
40:24:014:0	This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
40:24:015:0	“ Therefore when you see the which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
40:24:016:0	then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains .
40:24:017:0	Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house .
40:24:018:0	Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak .
40:24:019:0	But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
40:24:020:0	But pray that your flight will not be in the winter , or on a Sabbath .
40:24:021:0	For then there will be a great tribulation , such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now , nor ever will .
40:24:022:0	Unless those days had been cut short , no life would have been saved ; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short .
40:24:023:0	Then if anyone says to you , ‘Behold , here is the Christ , ’ or ‘There ’ do not believe
40:24:024:0	For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders , so as to mislead , if possible , even the elect .
40:24:025:0	Behold , I have told you in advance .
40:24:026:0	So if they say to you , ‘Behold , He is in the wilderness , ’ do not go out , ‘Behold , He is in the inner rooms , ’ do not believe
40:24:027:0	For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west , so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40:24:003:1	The Glorious Return
40:24:028:0	Wherever the corpse is , there the vultures will gather .
40:24:029:0	“ But immediately after the tribulation of those days , , from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
40:24:030:0	And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the S M with power and great glory .
40:24:004:1	Parable of the Fig Tree
40:24:031:0	And He will send forth His angels with and His elect from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
40:24:032:0	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree : when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves , you know that summer is near ;
40:24:033:0	so , you too , when you see all these things , recognize that He is near , at the door .
40:24:034:0	Truly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
40:24:035:0	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
40:24:036:0	“ But of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but the Father alone .
40:24:037:0	For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah .
40:24:038:0	For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered the ark ,
40:24:039:0	and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away ; so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40:24:040:0	Then there will be two men in the field ; one will be taken and one will be left .
40:24:005:1	Be Ready for His Coming
40:24:041:0	Two women grinding at the mill ; one will be taken and one will be left .
40:24:042:0	“ Therefore be on the alert , for you do not know which day your Lord is coming .
40:24:043:0	But be sure of this , that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming , he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
40:24:044:0	For this reason you also must be ready ; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think
40:24:045:0	“ Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time ?
40:24:046:0	Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes .
40:24:047:0	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
40:24:048:0	But if that evil slave says in his heart , ‘My master is not coming for a long time , ’
40:24:049:0	and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards ;
40:24:050:0	the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect and at an hour which he does not know ,
40:24:051:0	and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
