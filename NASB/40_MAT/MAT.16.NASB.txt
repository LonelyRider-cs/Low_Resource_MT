40:16:001:1	Pharisees Test Jesus
40:16:001:0	The Pharisees and Sadducees came up , and testing Jesus , they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven .
40:16:002:0	But He replied to them , “ When it is evening , you say , ‘ fair weather , for the sky is red . ’
40:16:003:0	And in the morning , ‘ a storm today , for the sky is red and threatening . ’ Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky , but cannot the signs of the times ?
40:16:004:0	An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign ; and a sign will not be given it , except the sign of Jonah . ” And He left them and went away .
40:16:005:0	And the disciples came to the other side of the sea , but they had forgotten to bring any bread .
40:16:006:0	And Jesus said to them , “ Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40:16:007:0	They began to discuss this among themselves , saying , “ He said that because we did not bring any bread . ”
40:16:008:0	But Jesus , aware of this , said , “ You men of little faith , why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread ?
40:16:009:0	Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets you picked up ?
40:16:010:0	Or the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many large baskets you picked up ?
40:16:011:0	How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread ? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40:16:002:1	Peter’s Confession of Christ
40:16:012:0	Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40:16:013:0	Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi , He was asking His disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
40:16:014:0	And they said , “ Some say John the Baptist ; and others , Elijah ; but still others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . ”
40:16:015:0	He *said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
40:16:016:0	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . ”
40:16:017:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Blessed are you , Simon Barjona , because flesh and blood did not reveal to you , but My Father who is in heaven .
40:16:018:0	I also say to you that you are Peter , and upon this rock I will build My church ; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it .
40:16:019:0	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven . ”
40:16:003:1	Jesus Foretells His Death
40:16:020:0	Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ .
40:16:021:0	From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem , and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised up on the third day .
40:16:022:0	Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him , saying , “ God forbid it , Lord ! This shall never happen to You . ”
40:16:004:1	Discipleship Is Costly
40:16:023:0	But He turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind Me , Satan ! You are a stumbling block to Me ; for you are not setting your mind on God’s interests , but man’s . ”
40:16:024:0	Then Jesus said to His disciples , “ If anyone wishes to come after Me , he must deny himself , and take up his cross and follow Me .
40:16:025:0	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it ; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it .
40:16:026:0	For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul ? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul ?
40:16:027:0	For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels , and .
40:16:028:0	“ Truly I say to you , there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom . ”
