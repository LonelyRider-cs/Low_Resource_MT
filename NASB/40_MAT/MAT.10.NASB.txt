40:10:001:1	The Twelve Disciples ; Instructions for Service
40:10:001:0	Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness .
40:10:002:0	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; and James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
40:10:003:0	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40:10:004:0	Simon the Zealot , and Judas Iscariot , the one who betrayed Him .
40:10:005:0	These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them : “ Do not go in way of Gentiles , and do not enter city of the Samaritans ;
40:10:006:0	but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40:10:007:0	And as you go , preach , saying , ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand . ’
40:10:008:0	Heal sick , raise dead , cleanse lepers , cast out demons . Freely you received , freely give .
40:10:009:0	Do not acquire gold , or silver , or copper for your money belts ,
40:10:010:0	or a bag for journey , or even two coats , or sandals , or a staff ; for the worker is worthy of his support .
40:10:011:0	And whatever city or village you enter , inquire who is worthy in it , and stay at his house until you leave
40:10:012:0	As you enter the house , give it your greeting .
40:10:013:0	If the house is worthy , give it your peace . But if it is not worthy , take back your peace .
40:10:014:0	Whoever does not receive you , nor heed your words , as you go out of that house or that city , shake the dust off your feet .
40:10:002:1	A Hard Road before Them
40:10:015:0	Truly I say to you , it will be more tolerable for land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city .
40:10:016:0	“ Behold , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves ; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves .
40:10:017:0	But beware of men , for they will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues ;
40:10:018:0	and you will even be brought before governors and kings for My sake , as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
40:10:019:0	But when they hand you over , do not worry about how or what you are to say ; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say .
40:10:020:0	For it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you .
40:10:021:0	“ Brother will betray brother to death , and a father child ; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death .
40:10:022:0	You will be hated by all because of My name , but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved .
40:10:003:1	The Meaning of Discipleship
40:10:023:0	“ But whenever they persecute you in one city , flee to the next ; for truly I say to you , you will not finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes .
40:10:024:0	“ A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a slave above his master .
40:10:025:0	It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul , how much more the members of his household !
40:10:026:0	“ Therefore do not fear them , for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
40:10:027:0	What I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear in ear , proclaim upon the housetops .
40:10:028:0	Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul ; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
40:10:029:0	Are not two sparrows sold for a cent ? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father .
40:10:030:0	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
40:10:031:0	So do not fear ; you are more valuable than many sparrows .
40:10:032:0	“ Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men , I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven .
40:10:033:0	But whoever denies Me before men , I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven .
40:10:034:0	“ Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth ; I did not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40:10:035:0	For I came to , , ;
40:10:036:0	and ’ .
40:10:037:0	“ He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me .
40:10:038:0	And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me .
40:10:004:1	The Reward of Service
40:10:039:0	He who has found his life will lose it , and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it .
40:10:040:0	“ He who receives you receives Me , and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me .
40:10:041:0	He who receives a prophet in name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward ; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward .
40:10:042:0	And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink , truly I say to you , he shall not lose his reward . ”
