40:26:001:1	The Plot to Kill Jesus
40:26:001:0	When Jesus had finished all these words , He said to His disciples ,
40:26:002:0	“ You know that after two days the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man is handed over for crucifixion . ”
40:26:003:0	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest , named Caiaphas ;
40:26:004:0	and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill Him .
40:26:002:1	The Precious Ointment
40:26:005:0	But they were saying , “ Not during the festival , otherwise a riot might occur among the people . ”
40:26:006:0	Now when Jesus was in Bethany , at the home of Simon the leper ,
40:26:007:0	a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume , and she poured it on His head as He reclined at the table .
40:26:008:0	But the disciples were indignant when they saw this , and said , “ Why this waste ?
40:26:009:0	For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor . ”
40:26:010:0	But Jesus , aware of this , said to them , “ Why do you bother the woman ? For she has done a good deed to Me .
40:26:011:0	For you always have the poor with you ; but you do not always have Me .
40:26:012:0	For when she poured this perfume on My body , she did it to prepare Me for burial .
40:26:003:1	Judas’s Bargain
40:26:013:0	Truly I say to you , wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her . ”
40:26:014:0	Then one of the twelve , named Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
40:26:015:0	and said , “ What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you ? ” And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him .
40:26:016:0	From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus .
40:26:017:0	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ”
40:26:018:0	And He said , “ Go into the city to a certain man , and say to him , ‘The Teacher says , “ My time is near ; I keep the Passover at your house with My disciples . ” ’ ”
40:26:004:1	The Last Passover
40:26:019:0	The disciples did as Jesus had directed them ; and they prepared the Passover .
40:26:020:0	Now when evening came , Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples .
40:26:021:0	As they were eating , He said , “ Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me . ”
40:26:022:0	Being deeply grieved , they each one began to say to Him , “ Surely not I , Lord ? ”
40:26:023:0	And He answered , “ He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me .
40:26:024:0	The Son of Man go , just as it is written of Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born . ”
40:26:005:1	The Lord’s Supper Instituted
40:26:025:0	And Judas , who was betraying Him , said , “ Surely it is not I , Rabbi ? ” Jesus *said to him , “ You have said yourself . ”
40:26:026:0	While they were eating , Jesus took some bread , and after a blessing , He broke it and gave it to the disciples , and said , “ Take , eat ; this is My body . ”
40:26:027:0	And when He had taken a cup and given thanks , He gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you ;
40:26:028:0	for this is My blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins .
40:26:029:0	But I say to you , I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom . ”
40:26:030:0	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40:26:031:0	Then Jesus *said to them , “ You will all fall away because of Me this night , for it is written , ‘I , . ’
40:26:032:0	But after I have been raised , I will go ahead of you to Galilee . ”
40:26:033:0	But Peter said to Him , “ Even though all may fall away because of You , I will never fall away . ”
40:26:034:0	Jesus said to him , “ Truly I say to you that this night , before a rooster crows , you will deny Me three times . ”
40:26:006:1	The Garden of Gethsemane
40:26:035:0	Peter *said to Him , “ Even if I have to die with You , I will not deny You . ” All the disciples said the same thing too .
40:26:036:0	Then Jesus *came with them to a place called Gethsemane , and *said to His disciples , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray . ”
40:26:037:0	And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be grieved and distressed .
40:26:038:0	Then He *said to them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , to the point of death ; remain here and keep watch with Me . ”
40:26:039:0	And He went a little beyond them , and fell on His face and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from Me ; yet not as I will , but as You will . ”
40:26:040:0	And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping , and *said to Peter , “ So , you could not keep watch with Me for one hour ?
40:26:041:0	Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation ; the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
40:26:042:0	He went away again a second time and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if this cannot pass away unless I drink it , Your will be done . ”
40:26:043:0	Again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40:26:044:0	And He left them again , and went away and prayed a third time , saying the same thing once more .
40:26:045:0	Then He *came to the disciples and *said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Behold , the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40:26:007:1	Jesus’ Betrayal and Arrest
40:26:046:0	Get up , let us be going ; behold , the one who betrays Me is at hand ! ”
40:26:047:0	While He was still speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came up accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs , who came from the chief priests and elders of the people .
40:26:048:0	Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , He is the one ; seize Him . ”
40:26:049:0	Immediately Judas went to Jesus and said , “ Hail , Rabbi ! ” and kissed Him .
40:26:050:0	And Jesus said to him , “ Friend , what you have come for . ” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him .
40:26:051:0	And behold , one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword , and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear .
40:26:052:0	Then Jesus *said to him , “ Put your sword back into its place ; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword .
40:26:053:0	Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father , and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels ?
40:26:054:0	How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must happen this way ? ”
40:26:055:0	At that time Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as against a robber ? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me .
40:26:008:1	Jesus before Caiaphas
40:26:056:0	But all this has taken place to fulfill the Scriptures of the prophets . ” Then all the disciples left Him and fled .
40:26:057:0	Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
40:26:058:0	But Peter was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest , and entered in , and sat down with the officers to see the outcome .
40:26:059:0	Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus , so that they might put Him to death .
40:26:060:0	They did not find any , even though many false witnesses came forward . But later on two came forward ,
40:26:061:0	and said , “ This man stated , ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days . ’ ”
40:26:062:0	The high priest stood up and said to Him , “ Do You not answer ? What is it that these men are testifying against You ? ”
40:26:063:0	But Jesus kept silent . And the high priest said to Him , “ I adjure You by the living God , that You tell us whether You are the Christ , the Son of God . ”
40:26:064:0	Jesus *said to him , “ You have said it nevertheless I tell you , hereafter you will see S M P , and . ”
40:26:065:0	Then the high priest tore his robes and said , “ He has blasphemed ! What further need do we have of witnesses ? Behold , you have now heard the blasphemy ;
40:26:066:0	what do you think ? ” They answered , “ He deserves death ! ”
40:26:067:0	Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists ; and others slapped Him ,
40:26:009:1	Peter’s Denials
40:26:068:0	and said , “ Prophesy to us , You Christ ; who is the one who hit You ? ”
40:26:069:0	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard , and a servant-girl came to him and said , “ You too were with Jesus the Galilean . ”
40:26:070:0	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I do not know what you are talking about . ”
40:26:071:0	When he had gone out to the gateway , another servant-girl saw him and *said to those who were there , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
40:26:072:0	And again he denied it with an oath , “ I do not know the man . ”
40:26:073:0	A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter , “ Surely you too are one of them ; for even the way you talk gives you away . ”
40:26:074:0	Then he began to curse and swear , “ I do not know the man ! ” And immediately a rooster crowed .
40:26:075:0	And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said , “ Before a rooster crows , you will deny Me three times . ” And he went out and wept bitterly .
