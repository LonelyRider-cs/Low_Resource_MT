40:19:001:1	Concerning Divorce
40:19:001:0	When Jesus had finished these words , He departed from Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan ;
40:19:002:0	and large crowds followed Him , and He healed them there .
40:19:003:0	Some Pharisees came to Jesus , testing Him and asking , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all ? ”
40:19:004:0	And He answered and said , “ Have you not read that He who created from the beginning ,
40:19:005:0	and said , ‘F , ’ ?
40:19:006:0	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let no man separate . ”
40:19:007:0	They *said to Him , “ Why then did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away ? ”
40:19:008:0	He *said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives ; but from the beginning it has not been this way .
40:19:009:0	And I say to you , whoever divorces his wife , except for immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery . ”
40:19:010:0	The disciples *said to Him , “ If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this , it is better not to marry . ”
40:19:011:0	But He said to them , “ Not all men accept this statement , but those to whom it has been given .
40:19:002:1	Jesus Blesses Little Children
40:19:012:0	For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb ; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men ; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . He who is able to accept let him accept ”
40:19:013:0	Then some children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray ; and the disciples rebuked them .
40:19:014:0	But Jesus said , “ Let the children alone , and do not hinder them from coming to Me ; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . ”
40:19:003:1	The Rich Young Ruler
40:19:015:0	After laying His hands on them , He departed from there .
40:19:016:0	And someone came to Him and said , “ Teacher , what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life ? ”
40:19:017:0	And He said to him , “ Why are you asking Me about what is good ? There is One who is good ; but if you wish to enter into life , keep the commandments . ”
40:19:018:0	Then he *said to Him , “ Which ones ? ” And Jesus said , “ Y ; Y ; Y ; Y ;
40:19:019:0	H ; and Y . ”
40:19:020:0	The young man *said to Him , “ All these things I have kept ; what am I still lacking ? ”
40:19:021:0	Jesus said to him , “ If you wish to be complete , go sell your possessions and give to poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me . ”
40:19:022:0	But when the young man heard this statement , he went away grieving ; for he was one who owned much property .
40:19:023:0	And Jesus said to His disciples , “ Truly I say to you , it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40:19:024:0	Again I say to you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . ”
40:19:025:0	When the disciples heard this , they were very astonished and said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
40:19:004:1	The Disciples’ Reward
40:19:026:0	And looking at them Jesus said to them , “ With people this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . ”
40:19:027:0	Then Peter said to Him , “ Behold , we have left everything and followed You ; what then will there be for us ? ”
40:19:028:0	And Jesus said to them , “ Truly I say to you , that you who have followed Me , in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne , you also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40:19:029:0	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name’s sake , will receive many times as much , and will inherit eternal life .
40:19:030:0	But many first will be last ; and last , first .
