40:15:001:1	Tradition and Commandment
40:15:001:0	Then some Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said ,
40:15:002:0	“ Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread . ”
40:15:003:0	And He answered and said to them , “ Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
40:15:004:0	For God said , ‘H , ’ and , ‘H . ’
40:15:005:0	But you say , ‘Whoever says to father or mother , “ Whatever I have that would help you has been given ”
40:15:006:0	he is not to honor his father or his mother . ’ And you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition .
40:15:007:0	You hypocrites , rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you :
40:15:008:0	‘T M , B M .
40:15:009:0	B M , T . ’ ”
40:15:010:0	After Jesus called the crowd to Him , He said to them , “ Hear and understand .
40:15:011:0	not what enters into the mouth defiles the man , but what proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . ”
40:15:012:0	Then the disciples *came and *said to Him , “ Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement ? ”
40:15:013:0	But He answered and said , “ Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted .
40:15:002:1	The Heart of Man
40:15:014:0	Let them alone ; they are blind guides of the blind . And if a blind man guides a blind man , both will fall into a pit . ”
40:15:015:0	Peter said to Him , “ Explain the parable to us . ”
40:15:016:0	Jesus said , “ Are you still lacking in understanding also ?
40:15:017:0	Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach , and is eliminated ?
40:15:018:0	But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart , and those defile the man .
40:15:019:0	For out of the heart come evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , slanders .
40:15:003:1	The Syrophoenician Woman
40:15:020:0	These are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man . ”
40:15:021:0	Jesus went away from there , and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon .
40:15:022:0	And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out , saying , “ Have mercy on me , Lord , Son of David ; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed . ”
40:15:023:0	But He did not answer her a word . And His disciples came and implored Him , saying , “ Send her away , because she keeps shouting at us . ”
40:15:024:0	But He answered and said , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . ”
40:15:025:0	But she came and began to bow down before Him , saying , “ Lord , help me ! ”
40:15:026:0	And He answered and said , “ It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . ”
40:15:027:0	But she said , “ Yes , Lord ; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table . ”
40:15:004:1	Healing Crowds
40:15:028:0	Then Jesus said to her , “ O woman , your faith is great ; it shall be done for you as you wish . ” And her daughter was healed at once .
40:15:029:0	Departing from there , Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee , and having gone up on the mountain , He was sitting there .
40:15:030:0	And large crowds came to Him , bringing with them those who were lame , crippled , blind , mute , and many others , and they laid them down at His feet ; and He healed them .
40:15:005:1	Four Thousand Fed
40:15:031:0	So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute speaking , the crippled restored , and the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they glorified the God of Israel .
40:15:032:0	And Jesus called His disciples to Him , and said , “ I feel compassion for the people , because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat ; and I do not want to send them away hungry , for they might faint on the way . ”
40:15:033:0	The disciples *said to Him , “ Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd ? ”
40:15:034:0	And Jesus *said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” And they said , “ Seven , and a few small fish . ”
40:15:035:0	And He directed the people to sit down on the ground ;
40:15:036:0	and He took the seven loaves and the fish ; and giving thanks , He broke them and started giving them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
40:15:037:0	And they all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces , seven large baskets full .
40:15:038:0	And those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
40:15:039:0	And sending away the crowds , Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan .
