40:8:001:1	Jesus Cleanses a Leper ; The Centurion’s Faith
40:8:001:0	When Jesus came down from the mountain , large crowds followed Him .
40:8:002:0	And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him , and said , “ Lord , if You are willing , You can make me clean . ”
40:8:003:0	Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be cleansed . ” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40:8:004:0	And Jesus *said to him , “ See that you tell no one ; but go , show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
40:8:005:0	And when Jesus entered Capernaum , a centurion came to Him , imploring Him ,
40:8:006:0	and saying , “ Lord , my servant is lying paralyzed at home , fearfully tormented . ”
40:8:007:0	Jesus *said to him , “ I will come and heal him . ”
40:8:008:0	But the centurion said , “ Lord , I am not worthy for You to come under my roof , but just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
40:8:009:0	For I also am a man under authority , with soldiers under me ; and I say to this one , ‘Go ! ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘Come ! ’ and he comes , and to my slave , ‘Do this ! ’ and he does it . ”
40:8:010:0	Now when Jesus heard this , He marveled and said to those who were following , “ Truly I say to you , I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel .
40:8:011:0	I say to you that many will come from east and west , and recline with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ;
40:8:012:0	but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness ; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40:8:002:1	Peter’s Mother-in-law and Many Others Healed
40:8:013:0	And Jesus said to the centurion , “ Go ; it shall be done for you as you have believed . ” And the servant was healed that very moment .
40:8:014:0	When Jesus came into Peter’s home , He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever .
40:8:015:0	He touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she got up and waited on Him .
40:8:016:0	When evening came , they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed ; and He cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were ill .
40:8:003:1	Discipleship Tested
40:8:017:0	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet : “ He Himself took our infirmities and carried away our diseases . ”
40:8:018:0	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him , He gave orders to depart to the other side of the sea .
40:8:019:0	Then a scribe came and said to Him , “ Teacher , I will follow You wherever You go . ”
40:8:020:0	Jesus *said to him , “ The foxes have holes and the birds of the air nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head . ”
40:8:021:0	Another of the disciples said to Him , “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father . ”
40:8:022:0	But Jesus *said to him , “ Follow Me , and allow the dead to bury their own dead . ”
40:8:023:0	When He got into the boat , His disciples followed Him .
40:8:024:0	And behold , there arose a great storm on the sea , so that the boat was being covered with the waves ; but Jesus Himself was asleep .
40:8:025:0	And they came to Him and woke Him , saying , “ Save us , Lord ; we are perishing ! ”
40:8:026:0	He *said to them , “ Why are you afraid , you men of little faith ? ” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and it became perfectly calm .
40:8:004:1	Jesus Casts Out Demons
40:8:027:0	The men were amazed , and said , “ What kind of a man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him ? ”
40:8:028:0	When He came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes , two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs . They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way .
40:8:029:0	And they cried out , saying , “ What business do we have with each other , Son of God ? Have You come here to torment us before the time ? ”
40:8:030:0	Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them .
40:8:031:0	The demons began to entreat Him , saying , “ If You are going to cast us out , send us into the herd of swine . ”
40:8:032:0	And He said to them , “ Go ! ” And they came out and went into the swine , and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters .
40:8:033:0	The herdsmen ran away , and went to the city and reported everything , including what had happened to the demoniacs .
40:8:034:0	And behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus ; and when they saw Him , they implored Him to leave their region .
