40:7:001:1	Judging Others
40:7:001:0	“ Do not judge so that you will not be judged .
40:7:002:0	For in the way you judge , you will be judged ; and by your standard of measure , it will be measured to you .
40:7:003:0	Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
40:7:004:0	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye , ’ and behold , the log is in your own eye ?
40:7:005:0	You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye .
40:7:002:1	Prayer and the Golden Rule
40:7:006:0	“ Do not give what is holy to dogs , and do not throw your pearls before swine , or they will trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
40:7:007:0	“ Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
40:7:008:0	For everyone who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
40:7:009:0	Or what man is there among you who , when his son asks for a loaf , will give him a stone ?
40:7:010:0	Or if he asks for a fish , he will not give him a snake , will he ?
40:7:011:0	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him !
40:7:003:1	The Narrow and Wide Gates
40:7:012:0	“ In everything , therefore , treat people the same way you want them to treat you , for this is the Law and the Prophets .
40:7:013:0	“ Enter through the narrow gate ; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction , and there are many who enter through it .
40:7:004:1	A Tree and Its Fruit
40:7:014:0	For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life , and there are few who find it .
40:7:015:0	“ Beware of the false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing , but inwardly are ravenous wolves .
40:7:016:0	You will know them by their fruits . Grapes are not gathered from thorn nor figs from thistles , are they ?
40:7:017:0	So every good tree bears good fruit , but the bad tree bears bad fruit .
40:7:018:0	A good tree cannot produce bad fruit , nor can a bad tree produce good fruit .
40:7:019:0	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40:7:020:0	So then , you will know them by their fruits .
40:7:021:0	“ Not everyone who says to Me , ‘Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven
40:7:022:0	Many will say to Me on that day , ‘Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in Your name , and in Your name cast out demons , and in Your name perform many miracles ? ’
40:7:005:1	The Two Foundations
40:7:023:0	And then I will declare to them , ‘I never knew you ; M , . ’
40:7:024:0	“ Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them , may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock .
40:7:025:0	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and slammed against that house ; and it did not fall , for it had been founded on the rock .
40:7:026:0	Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them , will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand .
40:7:027:0	The rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and slammed against that house ; and it fell—and great was its fall . ”
40:7:028:0	When Jesus had finished these words , the crowds were amazed at His teaching ;
40:7:029:0	for He was teaching them as one having authority , and not as their scribes .
