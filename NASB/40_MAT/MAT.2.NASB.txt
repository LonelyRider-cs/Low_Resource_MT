40:2:001:1	The Visit of the Magi
40:2:001:0	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem , saying ,
40:2:002:0	“ Where is He who has been born King of the Jews ? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him . ”
40:2:003:0	When Herod the king heard this , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40:2:004:0	Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born .
40:2:005:0	They said to him , “ In Bethlehem of Judea ; for this is what has been written by the prophet :
40:2:006:0	‘And you , Bethlehem , land of Judah , Are by no means least among the leaders of Judah ; For out of you shall come forth a RulerWho will shepherd My people Israel . ’ ”
40:2:007:0	Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared .
40:2:008:0	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and search carefully for the Child ; and when you have found Him , report to me , so that I too may come and worship Him . ”
40:2:009:0	After hearing the king , they went their way ; and the star , which they had seen in the east , went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was .
40:2:010:0	When they saw the star , they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy .
40:2:011:0	After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother ; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him . Then , opening their treasures , they presented to Him gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40:2:002:1	The Flight to Egypt
40:2:012:0	And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod , the magi left for their own country by another way .
40:2:013:0	Now when they had gone , behold , an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up ! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt , and remain there until I tell you ; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him . ”
40:2:014:0	So Joseph got up and took the Child and His mother while it was still night , and left for Egypt .

40:2:015:0	He remained there until the death of Herod . This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet : “ Out of Egypt I called My Son . ”
40:2:016:0	Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi , he became very enraged , and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had determined from the magi .
40:2:017:0	Then what had been spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled :
40:2:018:0	“ A voice was heard in Ramah , Weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; And she refused to be comforted , Because they were no more . ”
40:2:019:0	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , and said ,
40:2:020:0	“ Get up , take the Child and His mother , and go into the land of Israel ; for those who sought the Child’s life are dead . ”
40:2:021:0	So Joseph got up , took the Child and His mother , and came into the land of Israel .
40:2:022:0	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . Then after being warned by God in a dream , he left for the regions of Galilee ,
40:2:023:0	and came and lived in a city called Nazareth . This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets : “ He shall be called a Nazarene . ”
