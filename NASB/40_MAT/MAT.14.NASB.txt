40:14:001:1	John the Baptist Beheaded
40:14:001:0	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus ,
40:14:002:0	and said to his servants , “ This is John the Baptist ; he has risen from the dead , and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him . ”
40:14:003:0	For when Herod had John arrested , he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip .
40:14:004:0	For John had been saying to him , “ It is not lawful for you to have her . ”
40:14:005:0	Although Herod wanted to put him to death , he feared the crowd , because they regarded John as a prophet .
40:14:006:0	But when Herod’s birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod ,
40:14:007:0	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
40:14:008:0	Having been prompted by her mother , she *said , “ Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist . ”
40:14:009:0	Although he was grieved , the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths , and because of his dinner guests .
40:14:010:0	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
40:14:011:0	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40:14:002:1	Five Thousand Fed
40:14:012:0	His disciples came and took away the body and buried it ; and they went and reported to Jesus .
40:14:013:0	Now when Jesus heard about John , He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself ; and when the people heard of this , they followed Him on foot from the cities .
40:14:014:0	When He went ashore , He saw a large crowd , and felt compassion for them and healed their sick .
40:14:015:0	When it was evening , the disciples came to Him and said , “ This place is desolate and the hour is already late ; so send the crowds away , that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves . ”
40:14:016:0	But Jesus said to them , “ They do not need to go away ; you give them to eat ! ”
40:14:017:0	They *said to Him , “ We have here only five loaves and two fish . ”
40:14:018:0	And He said , “ Bring them here to Me . ”
40:14:019:0	Ordering the people to sit down on the grass , He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up toward heaven , He blessed the food , and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds ,
40:14:020:0	and they all ate and were satisfied . They picked up what was left over of the broken pieces , twelve full baskets .
40:14:003:1	Jesus Walks on the Water
40:14:021:0	There were about five thousand men who ate , besides women and children .
40:14:022:0	Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side , while He sent the crowds away .
40:14:023:0	After He had sent the crowds away , He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray ; and when it was evening , He was there alone .
40:14:024:0	But the boat was already a long distance from the land , battered by the waves ; for the wind was contrary .
40:14:025:0	And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them , walking on the sea .
40:14:026:0	When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were terrified , and said , “ It is a ghost ! ” And they cried out in fear .
40:14:027:0	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , “ Take courage , it is I ; do not be afraid . ”
40:14:028:0	Peter said to Him , “ Lord , if it is You , command me to come to You on the water . ”
40:14:029:0	And He said , “ Come ! ” And Peter got out of the boat , and walked on the water and came toward Jesus .
40:14:030:0	But seeing the wind , he became frightened , and beginning to sink , he cried out , “ Lord , save me ! ”
40:14:031:0	Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him , and *said to him , “ You of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
40:14:032:0	When they got into the boat , the wind stopped .
40:14:033:0	And those who were in the boat worshiped Him , saying , “ You are certainly God’s Son ! ”
40:14:034:0	When they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40:14:035:0	And when the men of that place recognized Him , they sent word into all that surrounding district and brought to Him all who were sick ;
40:14:036:0	and they implored Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak ; and as many as touched it were cured .
