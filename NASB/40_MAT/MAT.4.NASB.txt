40:4:001:1	The Temptation of Jesus
40:4:001:0	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40:4:002:0	And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights , He then became hungry .
40:4:003:0	And the tempter came and said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , command that these stones become bread . ”
40:4:004:0	But He answered and said , “ It is written , ‘M , G . ’ ”
40:4:005:0	Then the devil *took Him into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple ,
40:4:006:0	and *said to Him , “ If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down ; for it is written , ‘He will command His angels concerning You’ ; and‘On their hands they will bear You up , So that You will not strike Your foot against a stone . ’ ”
40:4:007:0	Jesus said to him , “ On the other hand , it is written , ‘Y L G . ’ ”
40:4:008:0	Again , the devil *took Him to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory ;
40:4:009:0	and he said to Him , “ All these things I will give You , if You fall down and worship me . ”
40:4:010:0	Then Jesus *said to him , “ Go , Satan ! For it is written , ‘Y L G , H . ’ ”
40:4:002:1	Jesus Begins His Ministry
40:4:011:0	Then the devil *left Him ; and behold , angels came and began to minister to Him .
40:4:012:0	Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody , He withdrew into Galilee ;
40:4:013:0	and leaving Nazareth , He came and settled in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40:4:014:0	This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet :
40:4:015:0	“ The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , By the way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles—
40:4:016:0	The people who were sitting in darkness saw a great Light , And those who were sitting in the land and shadow of death , Upon them a Light dawned . ”
40:4:003:1	The First Disciples
40:4:017:0	From that time Jesus began to preach and say , “ Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . ”
40:4:018:0	Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee , He saw two brothers , Simon who was called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
40:4:019:0	And He *said to them , “ Follow Me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
40:4:020:0	Immediately they left their nets and followed Him .
40:4:021:0	Going on from there He saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and He called them .
40:4:004:1	Ministry in Galilee
40:4:022:0	Immediately they left the boat and their father , and followed Him .
40:4:023:0	Jesus was going throughout all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people .
40:4:024:0	The news about Him spread throughout all Syria ; and they brought to Him all who were ill , those suffering with various diseases and pains , demoniacs , epileptics , paralytics ; and He healed them .
40:4:025:0	Large crowds followed Him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan .
