40:17:001:1	The Transfiguration
40:17:001:0	Six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John his brother , and *led them up on a high mountain by themselves .
40:17:002:0	And He was transfigured before them ; and His face shone like the sun , and His garments became as white as light .
40:17:003:0	And behold , Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Him .
40:17:004:0	Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good for us to be here ; if You wish , I will make three tabernacles here , one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40:17:005:0	While he was still speaking , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and behold , a voice out of the cloud said , “ This is My beloved Son , with whom I am well-pleased ; listen to Him ! ”
40:17:006:0	When the disciples heard this , they fell face down to the ground and were terrified .
40:17:007:0	And Jesus came to them and touched them and said , “ Get up , and do not be afraid . ”
40:17:008:0	And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone .
40:17:009:0	As they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , “ Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . ”
40:17:010:0	And His disciples asked Him , “ Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
40:17:011:0	And He answered and said , “ Elijah is coming and will restore all things ;
40:17:012:0	but I say to you that Elijah already came , and they did not recognize him , but did to him whatever they wished . So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands . ”
40:17:002:1	The Demoniac
40:17:013:0	Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist .
40:17:014:0	When they came to the crowd , a man came up to Jesus , falling on his knees before Him and saying ,
40:17:015:0	“ Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is a lunatic and is very ill ; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water .
40:17:016:0	I brought him to Your disciples , and they could not cure him . ”
40:17:017:0	And Jesus answered and said , “ You unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him here to Me . ”
40:17:018:0	And Jesus rebuked him , and the demon came out of him , and the boy was cured at once .
40:17:019:0	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said , “ Why could we not drive it out ? ”
40:17:020:0	And He *said to them , “ Because of the littleness of your faith ; for truly I say to you , if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ‘Move from here to there , ’ and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
40:17:021:0	[ But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting . ” ]
40:17:022:0	And while they were gathering together in Galilee , Jesus said to them , “ The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men ;
40:17:003:1	The Tribute Money
40:17:023:0	and they will kill Him , and He will be raised on the third day . ” And they were deeply grieved .
40:17:024:0	When they came to Capernaum , those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said , “ Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax ? ”
40:17:025:0	He *said , “ Yes . ” And when he came into the house , Jesus spoke to him first , saying , “ What do you think , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax , from their sons or from strangers ? ”
40:17:026:0	When Peter said , “ From strangers , ” Jesus said to him , “ Then the sons are exempt .
40:17:027:0	However , so that we do not offend them , go to the sea and throw in a hook , and take the first fish that comes up ; and when you open its mouth , you will find a shekel . Take that and give it to them for you and Me . ”
