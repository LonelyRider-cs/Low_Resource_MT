40:6:001:1	Giving to the Poor and Prayer
40:6:001:0	“ Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them ; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven .
40:6:002:0	“ So when you give to the poor , do not sound a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , so that they may be honored by men . Truly I say to you , they have their reward in full .
40:6:003:0	But when you give to the poor , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40:6:004:0	so that your giving will be in secret ; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40:6:005:0	“ When you pray , you are not to be like the hypocrites ; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men . Truly I say to you , they have their reward in full .
40:6:006:0	But you , when you pray , go into your inner room , close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40:6:007:0	“ And when you are praying , do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do , for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words .
40:6:008:0	So do not be like them ; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him .
40:6:009:0	“ Pray , then , in this way : ‘Our Father who is in heaven , Hallowed be Your name .
40:6:010:0	Your kingdom come . Your will be done , On earth as it is in heaven .
40:6:011:0	Give us this day our daily bread .
40:6:012:0	And forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
40:6:013:0	And do not lead us into temptation , but deliver us from evil . [ For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever . Amen . ’]
40:6:014:0	For if you forgive others for their transgressions , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40:6:002:1	Fasting ; The True Treasure ; Wealth ( Mammon )
40:6:015:0	But if you do not forgive others , then your Father will not forgive your transgressions .
40:6:016:0	“ Whenever you fast , do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting . Truly I say to you , they have their reward in full .
40:6:017:0	But you , when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face
40:6:018:0	so that your fasting will not be noticed by men , but by your Father who is in secret ; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40:6:019:0	“ Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy , and where thieves break in and steal .
40:6:020:0	But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys , and where thieves do not break in or steal ;
40:6:021:0	for where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
40:6:022:0	“ The eye is the lamp of the body ; so then if your eye is clear , your whole body will be full of light .
40:6:023:0	But if your eye is bad , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light that is in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
40:6:003:1	The Cure for Anxiety
40:6:024:0	“ No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and wealth .
40:6:025:0	“ For this reason I say to you , do not be worried about your life , what you will eat or what you will drink ; nor for your body , what you will put on . Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
40:6:026:0	Look at the birds of the air , that they do not sow , nor reap nor gather into barns , and your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not worth much more than they ?
40:6:027:0	And who of you by being worried can add a hour to his life ?
40:6:028:0	And why are you worried about clothing ? Observe how the lilies of the field grow ; they do not toil nor do they spin ,
40:6:029:0	yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these .
40:6:030:0	But if God so clothes the grass of the field , which is today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , not much more you ? You of little faith !
40:6:031:0	Do not worry then , saying , ‘What will we eat ? ’ or ‘What will we drink ? ’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing ? ’
40:6:032:0	For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things ; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
40:6:033:0	But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness , and all these things will be added to you .
40:6:034:0	“ So do not worry about tomorrow ; for tomorrow will care for itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .
