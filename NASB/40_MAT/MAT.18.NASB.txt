40:18:001:1	Rank in the Kingdom
40:18:001:0	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said , “ Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
40:18:002:0	And He called a child to Himself and set him before them ,
40:18:003:0	and said , “ Truly I say to you , unless you are converted and become like children , you will not enter the kingdom of heaven .
40:18:004:0	Whoever then humbles himself as this child , he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40:18:005:0	And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me ;
40:18:002:1	Stumbling Blocks
40:18:006:0	but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble , it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck , and to be drowned in the depth of the sea .
40:18:007:0	“ Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks ! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come ; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes !
40:18:008:0	“ If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it from you ; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame , than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire .
40:18:009:0	If your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it from you . It is better for you to enter life with one eye , than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell .
40:18:010:0	“ See that you do not despise one of these little ones , for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven .
40:18:003:1	Ninety-nine Plus One
40:18:011:0	[ For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost . ]
40:18:012:0	“ What do you think ? If any man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone astray , does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying ?
40:18:013:0	If it turns out that he finds it , truly I say to you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray .
40:18:004:1	Discipline and Prayer
40:18:014:0	So it is not will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish .
40:18:015:0	“ If your brother sins , go and show him his fault in private ; if he listens to you , you have won your brother .
40:18:016:0	But if he does not listen take one or two more with you , so that .
40:18:017:0	If he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector .
40:18:018:0	Truly I say to you , whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven .
40:18:019:0	“ Again I say to you , that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask , it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven .
40:18:005:1	Forgiveness
40:18:020:0	For where two or three have gathered together in My name , I am there in their midst . ”
40:18:021:0	Then Peter came and said to Him , “ Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him ? Up to seven times ? ”
40:18:022:0	Jesus *said to him , “ I do not say to you , up to seven times , but up to seventy times seven .
40:18:023:0	“ For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves .
40:18:024:0	When he had begun to settle one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him .
40:18:025:0	But since he did not have to repay , his lord commanded him to be sold , along with his wife and children and all that he had , and repayment to be made .
40:18:026:0	So the slave fell and prostrated himself before him , saying , ‘Have patience with me and I will repay you everything . ’
40:18:027:0	And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt .
40:18:028:0	But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii ; and he seized him and to choke saying , ‘Pay back what you owe . ’
40:18:029:0	So his fellow slave fell and to plead with him , saying , ‘Have patience with me and I will repay you . ’
40:18:030:0	But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed .
40:18:031:0	So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened .
40:18:032:0	Then summoning him , his lord *said to him , ‘You wicked slave , I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me .
40:18:033:0	Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave , in the same way that I had mercy on you ? ’
40:18:034:0	And his lord , moved with anger , handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him .
40:18:035:0	My heavenly Father will also do the same to you , if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart . ”
