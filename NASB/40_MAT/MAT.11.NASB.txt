40:11:001:1	John’s Questions
40:11:001:0	When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples , He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities .
40:11:002:0	Now when John , while imprisoned , heard of the works of Christ , he sent word by his disciples
40:11:003:0	and said to Him , “ Are You the Expected One , or shall we look for someone else ? ”
40:11:004:0	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Go and report to John what you hear and see :
40:11:005:0	and lame walk , lepers are cleansed and deaf hear , dead are raised up , and .
40:11:002:1	Jesus’ Tribute to John
40:11:006:0	And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me . ”
40:11:007:0	As these men were going away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John , “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40:11:008:0	But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft Those who wear soft are in kings’ palaces !
40:11:009:0	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one who is more than a prophet .
40:11:010:0	This is the one about whom it is written , ‘B , I M Y , W Y Y . ’
40:11:011:0	Truly I say to you , among those born of women there has not arisen greater than John the Baptist ! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40:11:012:0	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence , and violent men take it by force .
40:11:013:0	For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
40:11:014:0	And if you are willing to accept John himself is Elijah who was to come .
40:11:015:0	He who has ears to hear , let him hear .
40:11:016:0	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the market places , who call out to the other
40:11:017:0	and say , ‘We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not mourn . ’
40:11:018:0	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘He has a demon ! ’
40:11:003:1	The Unrepenting Cities
40:11:019:0	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘Behold , a gluttonous man and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds . ”
40:11:020:0	Then He began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles were done , because they did not repent .
40:11:021:0	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40:11:022:0	Nevertheless I say to you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in day of judgment than for you .
40:11:023:0	And you , Capernaum , will not be exalted to heaven , will you ? You will descend to Hades ; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you , it would have remained to this day .
40:11:004:1	Come to Me
40:11:024:0	Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in day of judgment , than for you . ”
40:11:025:0	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have hidden these things from wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants .
40:11:026:0	Yes , Father , for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight .
40:11:027:0	All things have been handed over to Me by My Father ; and no one knows the Son except the Father ; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal
40:11:028:0	“ Come to Me , all who are weary and heavy-laden , and I will give you rest .
40:11:029:0	Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and .
40:11:030:0	For My yoke is easy and My burden is light . ”
