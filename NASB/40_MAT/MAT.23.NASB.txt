40:23:001:1	Pharisaism Exposed
40:23:001:0	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples ,
40:23:002:0	saying : “ The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses ;
40:23:003:0	therefore all that they tell you , do and observe , but do not do according to their deeds ; for they say and do not do
40:23:004:0	They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men’s shoulders , but they themselves are unwilling to move them with a finger .
40:23:005:0	But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men ; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels
40:23:006:0	They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
40:23:007:0	and respectful greetings in the market places , and being called Rabbi by men .
40:23:008:0	But do not be called Rabbi ; for One is your Teacher , and you are all brothers .
40:23:009:0	Do not call on earth your father ; for One is your Father , He who is in heaven .
40:23:010:0	Do not be called leaders ; for One is your Leader , Christ .
40:23:011:0	But the greatest among you shall be your servant .
40:23:002:1	Eight Woes
40:23:012:0	Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled ; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted .
40:23:013:0	“ But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people ; for you do not enter in yourselves , nor do you allow those who are entering to go in .
40:23:014:0	[ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because you devour widows’ houses , and for a pretense you make long prayers ; therefore you will receive greater condemnation . ]
40:23:015:0	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte ; and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves .
40:23:016:0	“ Woe to you , blind guides , who say , ‘Whoever swears by the temple , is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated . ’
40:23:017:0	You fools and blind men ! Which is more important , the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold ?
40:23:018:0	And , ‘Whoever swears by the altar , is nothing , but whoever swears by the offering on it , he is obligated . ’
40:23:019:0	You blind men , which is more important , the offering , or the altar that sanctifies the offering ?
40:23:020:0	Therefore , whoever swears by the altar , swears by the altar and by everything on it .
40:23:021:0	And whoever swears by the temple , swears by the temple and by Him who dwells within it .
40:23:022:0	And whoever swears by heaven , swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it .
40:23:023:0	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin , and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law : justice and mercy and faithfulness ; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others .
40:23:024:0	You blind guides , who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel !
40:23:025:0	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish , but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence .
40:23:026:0	You blind Pharisee , first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish , so that the outside of it may become clean also .
40:23:027:0	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful , but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness .
40:23:028:0	So you , too , outwardly appear righteous to men , but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40:23:029:0	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous ,
40:23:030:0	and say , ‘If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets . ’
40:23:031:0	So you testify against yourselves , that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets .
40:23:032:0	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers .
40:23:033:0	You serpents , you brood of vipers , how will you escape the sentence of hell ?
40:23:034:0	“ Therefore , behold , I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes ; some of them you will kill and crucify , and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city ,
40:23:035:0	so that upon you may fall all the righteous blood shed on earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , whom you murdered between the temple and the altar .
40:23:003:1	Lament over Jerusalem
40:23:036:0	Truly I say to you , all these things will come upon this generation .
40:23:037:0	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her ! How often I wanted to gather your children together , the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , and you were unwilling .
40:23:038:0	Behold , your house is being left to you desolate !
40:23:039:0	For I say to you , from now on you will not see Me until you say , ‘B H L ! ’ ”
