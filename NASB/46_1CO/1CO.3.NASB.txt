46:3:001:1	Foundations for Living
46:3:001:0	And I , brethren , could not speak to you as to spiritual men , but as to men of flesh , as to infants in Christ .
46:3:002:0	I gave you milk to drink , not solid food ; for you were not yet able to receive it . Indeed , even now you are not yet able ,
46:3:003:0	for you are still fleshly . For since there is jealousy and strife among you , are you not fleshly , and are you not walking like mere men ?
46:3:004:0	For when one says , “ I am of Paul , ” and another , “ I am of Apollos , ” are you not mere men ?
46:3:005:0	What then is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? Servants through whom you believed , even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one .
46:3:006:0	I planted , Apollos watered , but God was causing the growth .
46:3:007:0	So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but God who causes the growth .
46:3:008:0	Now he who plants and he who waters are one ; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
46:3:009:0	For we are God’s fellow workers ; you are God’s field , God’s building .
46:3:010:0	According to the grace of God which was given to me , like a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another is building on it . But each man must be careful how he builds on it .
46:3:011:0	For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46:3:012:0	Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
46:3:013:0	each man’s work will become evident ; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire , and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work .
46:3:014:0	If any man’s work which he has built on it remains , he will receive a reward .
46:3:015:0	If any man’s work is burned up , he will suffer loss ; but he himself will be saved , yet so as through fire .
46:3:016:0	Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
46:3:017:0	If any man destroys the temple of God , God will destroy him , for the temple of God is holy , and that is what you are .
46:3:018:0	Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age , he must become foolish , so that he may become wise .
46:3:019:0	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God . For it is written , “ He is the one who catches the wise in their craftiness ” ;
46:3:020:0	and again , “ The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise , that they are useless . ”
46:3:021:0	So then let no one boast in men . For all things belong to you ,
46:3:022:0	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come ; all things belong to you ,
46:3:023:0	and you belong to Christ ; and Christ belongs to God .
