46:9:001:1	Paul’s Use of Liberty
46:9:001:0	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46:9:002:0	If to others I am not an apostle , at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46:9:003:0	My defense to those who examine me is this :
46:9:004:0	Do we not have a right to eat and drink ?
46:9:005:0	Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife , even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas ?
46:9:006:0	Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working ?
46:9:007:0	Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it ? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock ?
46:9:008:0	I am not speaking these things according to human judgment , am I ? Or does not the Law also say these things ?
46:9:009:0	For it is written in the Law of Moses , “ You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing . ” God is not concerned about oxen , is He ?
46:9:010:0	Or is He speaking altogether for our sake ? Yes , for our sake it was written , because the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops .
46:9:011:0	If we sowed spiritual things in you , is it too much if we reap material things from you ?
46:9:012:0	If others share the right over you , do we not more ? Nevertheless , we did not use this right , but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ .
46:9:013:0	Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple , and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share from the altar ?
46:9:014:0	So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel .
46:9:015:0	But I have used none of these things . And I am not writing these things so that it will be done so in my case ; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one .
46:9:016:0	For if I preach the gospel , I have nothing to boast of , for I am under compulsion ; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel .
46:9:017:0	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a reward ; but if against my will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
46:9:018:0	What then is my reward ? That , when I preach the gospel , I may offer the gospel without charge , so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel .
46:9:019:0	For though I am free from all men , I have made myself a slave to all , so that I may win more .
46:9:020:0	To the Jews I became as a Jew , so that I might win Jews ; to those who are under the Law , as under the Law though not being myself under the Law , so that I might win those who are under the Law ;
46:9:021:0	to those who are without law , as without law , though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ , so that I might win those who are without law .
46:9:022:0	To the weak I became weak , that I might win the weak ; I have become all things to all men , so that I may by all means save some .
46:9:023:0	I do all things for the sake of the gospel , so that I may become a fellow partaker of it .
46:9:024:0	Do you not know that those who run in a race all run , but only one receives the prize ? Run in such a way that you may win .
46:9:025:0	Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things . They then do it to receive a perishable wreath , but we an imperishable .
46:9:026:0	Therefore I run in such a way , as not without aim ; I box in such a way , as not beating the air ;
46:9:027:0	but I discipline my body and make it my slave , so that , after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified .
