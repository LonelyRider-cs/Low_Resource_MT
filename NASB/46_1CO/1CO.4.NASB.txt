46:4:001:1	Servants of Christ
46:4:001:0	Let a man regard us in this manner , as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God .
46:4:002:0	In this case , moreover , it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy .
46:4:003:0	But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you , or by any human court ; in fact , I do not even examine myself .
46:4:004:0	For I am conscious of nothing against myself , yet I am not by this acquitted ; but the one who examines me is the Lord .
46:4:005:0	Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time , but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men’s hearts ; and then each man’s praise will come to him from God .
46:4:006:0	Now these things , brethren , I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes , so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written , so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against the other .
46:4:007:0	For who regards you as superior ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
46:4:008:0	You are already filled , you have already become rich , you have become kings without us ; and indeed , I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you .
46:4:009:0	For , I think , God has exhibited us apostles last of all , as men condemned to death ; because we have become a spectacle to the world , both to angels and to men .
46:4:010:0	We are fools for Christ’s sake , but you are prudent in Christ ; we are weak , but you are strong ; you are distinguished , but we are without honor .
46:4:011:0	To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty , and are poorly clothed , and are roughly treated , and are homeless ;
46:4:012:0	and we toil , working with our own hands ; when we are reviled , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure ;
46:4:013:0	when we are slandered , we try to conciliate ; we have become as the scum of the world , the dregs of all things , even until now .
46:4:014:0	I do not write these things to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
46:4:015:0	For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ , yet you would not have many fathers , for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel .
46:4:016:0	Therefore I exhort you , be imitators of me .
46:4:017:0	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , just as I teach everywhere in every church .
46:4:018:0	Now some have become arrogant , as though I were not coming to you .
46:4:019:0	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord wills , and I shall find out , not the words of those who are arrogant but their power .
46:4:020:0	For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power .
46:4:021:0	What do you desire ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or with love and a spirit of gentleness ?
