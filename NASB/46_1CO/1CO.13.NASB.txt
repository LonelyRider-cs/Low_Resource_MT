46:13:001:1	The Excellence of Love
46:13:001:0	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , but do not have love , I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46:13:002:0	If I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
46:13:003:0	And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor , and if I surrender my body to be burned , but do not have love , it profits me nothing .
46:13:004:0	Love is patient , love is kind and is not jealous ; love does not brag and is not arrogant ,
46:13:005:0	does not act unbecomingly ; it does not seek its own , is not provoked , does not take into account a wrong suffered ,
46:13:006:0	does not rejoice in unrighteousness , but rejoices with the truth ;
46:13:007:0	bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
46:13:008:0	Love never fails ; but if there are gifts of prophecy , they will be done away ; if there are tongues , they will cease ; if there is knowledge , it will be done away .
46:13:009:0	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ;
46:13:010:0	but when the perfect comes , the partial will be done away .
46:13:011:0	When I was a child , I used to speak like a child , think like a child , reason like a child ; when I became a man , I did away with childish things .
46:13:012:0	For now we see in a mirror dimly , but then face to face ; now I know in part , but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known .
46:13:013:0	But now faith , hope , love , abide these three ; but the greatest of these is love .
