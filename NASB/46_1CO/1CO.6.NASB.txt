46:6:001:1	Lawsuits Discouraged
46:6:001:0	Does any one of you , when he has a case against his neighbor , dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints ?
46:6:002:0	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? If the world is judged by you , are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts ?
46:6:003:0	Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more matters of this life ?
46:6:004:0	So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life , do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church ?
46:6:005:0	I say this to your shame . Is it so , that there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his brethren ,
46:6:006:0	but brother goes to law with brother , and that before unbelievers ?
46:6:007:0	Actually , then , it is already a defeat for you , that you have lawsuits with one another . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
46:6:008:0	On the contrary , you yourselves wrong and defraud . You do this even to your brethren .
46:6:009:0	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ; neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor homosexuals ,
46:6:010:0	nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers , will inherit the kingdom of God .
46:6:002:1	The Body Is the Lord’s
46:6:011:0	Such were some of you ; but you were washed , but you were sanctified , but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46:6:012:0	All things are lawful for me , but not all things are profitable . All things are lawful for me , but I will not be mastered by anything .
46:6:013:0	Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food , but God will do away with both of them . Yet the body is not for immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
46:6:014:0	Now God has not only raised the Lord , but will also raise us up through His power .
46:6:015:0	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
46:6:016:0	Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her ? For He says , “ The two shall become one flesh . ”
46:6:017:0	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him .
46:6:018:0	Flee immorality . Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body , but the immoral man sins against his own body .
46:6:019:0	Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you , whom you have from God , and that you are not your own ?
46:6:020:0	For you have been bought with a price : therefore glorify God in your body .
