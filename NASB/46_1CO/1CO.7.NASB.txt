46:7:001:1	Teaching on Marriage
46:7:001:0	Now concerning the things about which you wrote , it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
46:7:002:0	But because of immoralities , each man is to have his own wife , and each woman is to have her own husband .
46:7:003:0	The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
46:7:004:0	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does ; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
46:7:005:0	Stop depriving one another , except by agreement for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer , and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46:7:006:0	But this I say by way of concession , not of command .
46:7:007:0	Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am . However , each man has his own gift from God , one in this manner , and another in that .
46:7:008:0	But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I .
46:7:009:0	But if they do not have self-control , let them marry ; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
46:7:010:0	But to the married I give instructions , not I , but the Lord , that the wife should not leave her husband
46:7:011:0	( but if she does leave , she must remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband should not divorce his wife .
46:7:012:0	But to the rest I say , not the Lord , that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever , and she consents to live with him , he must not divorce her .
46:7:013:0	And a woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he consents to live with her , she must not send her husband away .
46:7:014:0	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband ; for otherwise your children are unclean , but now they are holy .
46:7:015:0	Yet if the unbelieving one leaves , let him leave ; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us to peace .
46:7:016:0	For how do you know , O wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , O husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46:7:017:0	Only , as the Lord has assigned to each one , as God has called each , in this manner let him walk . And so I direct in all the churches .
46:7:018:0	Was any man called when he was already circumcised ? He is not to become uncircumcised . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? He is not to be circumcised .
46:7:019:0	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God .
46:7:020:0	Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called .
46:7:021:0	Were you called while a slave ? Do not worry about it ; but if you are able also to become free , rather do that .
46:7:022:0	For he who was called in the Lord while a slave , is the Lord’s freedman ; likewise he who was called while free , is Christ’s slave .
46:7:023:0	You were bought with a price ; do not become slaves of men .
46:7:024:0	Brethren , each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called .
46:7:025:0	Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord , but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy .
46:7:026:0	I think then that this is good in view of the present distress , that it is good for a man to remain as he is .
46:7:027:0	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be released . Are you released from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
46:7:028:0	But if you marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet such will have trouble in this life , and I am trying to spare you .
46:7:029:0	But this I say , brethren , the time has been shortened , so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none ;
46:7:030:0	and those who weep , as though they did not weep ; and those who rejoice , as though they did not rejoice ; and those who buy , as though they did not possess ;
46:7:031:0	and those who use the world , as though they did not make full use of it ; for the form of this world is passing away .
46:7:032:0	But I want you to be free from concern . One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
46:7:033:0	but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife ,
46:7:034:0	and his interests are divided . The woman who is unmarried , and the virgin , is concerned about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and spirit ; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
46:7:035:0	This I say for your own benefit ; not to put a restraint upon you , but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord .
46:7:036:0	But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter , if she is past her youth , and if it must be so , let him do what he wishes , he does not sin ; let her marry .
46:7:037:0	But he who stands firm in his heart , being under no constraint , but has authority over his own will , and has decided this in his own heart , to keep his own virgin daughter , he will do well .
46:7:038:0	So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well , and he who does not give her in marriage will do better .
46:7:039:0	A wife is bound as long as her husband lives ; but if her husband is dead , she is free to be married to whom she wishes , only in the Lord .
46:7:040:0	But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is ; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God .
