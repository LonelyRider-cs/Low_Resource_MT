46:5:001:1	Immorality Rebuked
46:5:001:0	It is actually reported that there is immorality among you , and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles , that someone has his father’s wife .
46:5:002:0	You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead , so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst .
46:5:003:0	For I , on my part , though absent in body but present in spirit , have already judged him who has so committed this , as though I were present .
46:5:004:0	In the name of our Lord Jesus , when you are assembled , and I with you in spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46:5:005:0	I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh , so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46:5:006:0	Your boasting is not good . Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough ?
46:5:007:0	Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump , just as you are in fact unleavened . For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed .
46:5:008:0	Therefore let us celebrate the feast , not with old leaven , nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46:5:009:0	I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people ;
46:5:010:0	I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world , or with the covetous and swindlers , or with idolaters , for then you would have to go out of the world .
46:5:011:0	But actually , I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person , or covetous , or an idolater , or a reviler , or a drunkard , or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one .
46:5:012:0	For what have I to do with judging outsiders ? Do you not judge those who are within the church ?
46:5:013:0	But those who are outside , God judges . Remove the wicked man from among yourselves .
