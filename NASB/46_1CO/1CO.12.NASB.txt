46:12:001:1	The Use of Spiritual Gifts
46:12:001:0	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , I do not want you to be unaware .
46:12:002:0	You know that when you were pagans , you were led astray to the mute idols , however you were led .
46:12:003:0	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says , “ Jesus is accursed ” ; and no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” except by the Holy Spirit .
46:12:004:0	Now there are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit .
46:12:005:0	And there are varieties of ministries , and the same Lord .
46:12:006:0	There are varieties of effects , but the same God who works all things in all persons .
46:12:007:0	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good .
46:12:008:0	For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit , and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit ;
46:12:009:0	to another faith by the same Spirit , and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit ,
46:12:010:0	and to another the effecting of miracles , and to another prophecy , and to another the distinguishing of spirits , to another various kinds of tongues , and to another the interpretation of tongues .
46:12:011:0	But one and the same Spirit works all these things , distributing to each one individually just as He wills .
46:12:012:0	For even as the body is one and yet has many members , and all the members of the body , though they are many , are one body , so also is Christ .
46:12:013:0	For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free , and we were all made to drink of one Spirit .
46:12:014:0	For the body is not one member , but many .
46:12:015:0	If the foot says , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not a part of the body , ” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body .
46:12:016:0	And if the ear says , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not a part of the body , ” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body .
46:12:017:0	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were hearing , where would the sense of smell be ?
46:12:018:0	But now God has placed the members , each one of them , in the body , just as He desired .
46:12:019:0	If they were all one member , where would the body be ?
46:12:020:0	But now there are many members , but one body .
46:12:021:0	And the eye cannot say to the hand , “ I have no need of you ” ; or again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you . ”
46:12:022:0	On the contrary , it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary ;
46:12:023:0	and those members of the body which we deem less honorable , on these we bestow more abundant honor , and our less presentable members become much more presentable ,
46:12:024:0	whereas our more presentable members have no need of it . But God has so composed the body , giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked ,
46:12:025:0	so that there may be no division in the body , but that the members may have the same care for one another .
46:12:026:0	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; if one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
46:12:027:0	Now you are Christ’s body , and individually members of it .
46:12:028:0	And God has appointed in the church , first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , administrations , various kinds of tongues .
46:12:029:0	All are not apostles , are they ? All are not prophets , are they ? All are not teachers , are they ? All are not workers of miracles , are they ?
46:12:030:0	All do not have gifts of healings , do they ? All do not speak with tongues , do they ? All do not interpret , do they ?
46:12:031:0	But earnestly desire the greater gifts . And I show you a still more excellent way .
