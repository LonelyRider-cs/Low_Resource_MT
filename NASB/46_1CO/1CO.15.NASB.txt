46:15:001:1	The Fact of Christ’s Resurrection
46:15:001:0	Now I make known to you , brethren , the gospel which I preached to you , which also you received , in which also you stand ,
46:15:002:0	by which also you are saved , if you hold fast the word which I preached to you , unless you believed in vain .
46:15:003:0	For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received , that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
46:15:004:0	and that He was buried , and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ,
46:15:005:0	and that He appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
46:15:006:0	After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time , most of whom remain until now , but some have fallen asleep ;
46:15:007:0	then He appeared to James , then to all the apostles ;
46:15:008:0	and last of all , as to one untimely born , He appeared to me also .
46:15:009:0	For I am the least of the apostles , and not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46:15:010:0	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me did not prove vain ; but I labored even more than all of them , yet not I , but the grace of God with me .
46:15:011:0	Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed .
46:15:012:0	Now if Christ is preached , that He has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46:15:013:0	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , not even Christ has been raised ;
46:15:014:0	and if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is vain , your faith also is vain .
46:15:015:0	Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God , because we testified against God that He raised Christ , whom He did not raise , if in fact the dead are not raised .
46:15:016:0	For if the dead are not raised , not even Christ has been raised ;
46:15:017:0	and if Christ has not been raised , your faith is worthless ; you are still in your sins .
46:15:018:0	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
46:15:002:1	The Order of Resurrection
46:15:019:0	If we have hoped in Christ in this life only , we are of all men most to be pitied .
46:15:020:0	But now Christ has been raised from the dead , the first fruits of those who are asleep .
46:15:021:0	For since by a man came death , by a man also came the resurrection of the dead .
46:15:022:0	For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
46:15:023:0	But each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , after that those who are Christ’s at His coming ,
46:15:024:0	then comes the end , when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father , when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power .
46:15:025:0	For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet .
46:15:026:0	The last enemy that will be abolished is death .
46:15:027:0	For He has put all things in subjection under His feet . But when He says , “ All things are put in subjection , ” it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him .
46:15:028:0	When all things are subjected to Him , then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him , so that God may be all in all .
46:15:029:0	Otherwise , what will those do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why then are they baptized for them ?
46:15:030:0	Why are we also in danger every hour ?
46:15:031:0	I affirm , brethren , by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
46:15:032:0	If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus , what does it profit me ? If the dead are not raised , let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die .
46:15:033:0	Do not be deceived : “ Bad company corrupts good morals . ”
46:15:034:0	Become sober-minded as you ought , and stop sinning ; for some have no knowledge of God . I speak this to your shame .
46:15:035:0	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? And with what kind of body do they come ? ”
46:15:036:0	You fool ! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies ;
46:15:037:0	and that which you sow , you do not sow the body which is to be , but a bare grain , perhaps of wheat or of something else .
46:15:038:0	But God gives it a body just as He wished , and to each of the seeds a body of its own .
46:15:039:0	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another flesh of birds , and another of fish .
46:15:040:0	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the glory of the heavenly is one , and the glory of the earthly is another .
46:15:041:0	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
46:15:042:0	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown a perishable body , it is raised an imperishable body ;
46:15:043:0	it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
46:15:044:0	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46:15:045:0	So also it is written , “ The first man , Adam , became a living soul . ” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
46:15:046:0	However , the spiritual is not first , but the natural ; then the spiritual .
46:15:047:0	The first man is from the earth , earthy ; the second man is from heaven .
46:15:048:0	As is the earthy , so also are those who are earthy ; and as is the heavenly , so also are those who are heavenly .
46:15:003:1	The Mystery of Resurrection
46:15:049:0	Just as we have borne the image of the earthy , we will also bear the image of the heavenly .
46:15:050:0	Now I say this , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable .
46:15:051:0	Behold , I tell you a mystery ; we will not all sleep , but we will all be changed ,
46:15:052:0	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet ; for the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed .
46:15:053:0	For this perishable must put on the imperishable , and this mortal must put on immortality .
46:15:054:0	But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable , and this mortal will have put on immortality , then will come about the saying that is written , “ Death is swallowed up in victory .
46:15:055:0	O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ”
46:15:056:0	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law ;
46:15:057:0	but thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46:15:058:0	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord .
