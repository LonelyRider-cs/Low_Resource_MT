46:16:001:1	Instructions and Greetings
46:16:001:0	Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I directed the churches of Galatia , so do you also .
46:16:002:0	On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save , as he may prosper , so that no collections be made when I come .
46:16:003:0	When I arrive , whomever you may approve , I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem ;
46:16:004:0	and if it is fitting for me to go also , they will go with me .
46:16:005:0	But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia , for I am going through Macedonia ;
46:16:006:0	and perhaps I will stay with you , or even spend the winter , so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go .
46:16:007:0	For I do not wish to see you now just in passing ; for I hope to remain with you for some time , if the Lord permits .
46:16:008:0	But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost ;
46:16:009:0	for a wide door for effective service has opened to me , and there are many adversaries .
46:16:010:0	Now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without cause to be afraid , for he is doing the Lord’s work , as I also am .
46:16:011:0	So let no one despise him . But send him on his way in peace , so that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brethren .
46:16:012:0	But concerning Apollos our brother , I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren ; and it was not at all his desire to come now , but he will come when he has opportunity .
46:16:013:0	Be on the alert , stand firm in the faith , act like men , be strong .
46:16:014:0	Let all that you do be done in love .
46:16:015:0	Now I urge you , brethren ( you know the household of Stephanas , that they were the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints ) ,
46:16:016:0	that you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors .
46:16:017:0	I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , because they have supplied what was lacking on your part .
46:16:018:0	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore acknowledge such men .
46:16:019:0	The churches of Asia greet you . Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
46:16:020:0	All the brethren greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46:16:021:0	The greeting is in my own hand—Paul .
46:16:022:0	If anyone does not love the Lord , he is to be accursed . Maranatha .
46:16:023:0	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46:16:024:0	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
