46:2:001:1	Paul’s Reliance upon the Spirit
46:2:001:0	And when I came to you , brethren , I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
46:2:002:0	For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ , and Him crucified .
46:2:003:0	I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling ,
46:2:004:0	and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
46:2:005:0	so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men , but on the power of God .
46:2:006:0	Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature ; a wisdom , however , not of this age nor of the rulers of this age , who are passing away ;
46:2:007:0	but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery , the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory ;
46:2:008:0	the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood ; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory ;
46:2:009:0	but just as it is written , “ Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard , And which have not entered the heart of man , All that God has prepared for those who love Him . ”
46:2:010:0	For to us God revealed them through the Spirit ; for the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .
46:2:011:0	For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him ? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God .
46:2:012:0	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may know the things freely given to us by God ,
46:2:013:0	which things we also speak , not in words taught by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Spirit , combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words .
46:2:014:0	But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him ; and he cannot understand them , because they are spiritually appraised .
46:2:015:0	But he who is spiritual appraises all things , yet he himself is appraised by no one .
46:2:016:0	For who has known the mind of the Lord , that he will instruct Him ? But we have the mind of Christ .
