46:10:001:1	Avoid Israel’s Mistakes
46:10:001:0	For I do not want you to be unaware , brethren , that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea ;
46:10:002:0	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
46:10:003:0	and all ate the same spiritual food ;
46:10:004:0	and all drank the same spiritual drink , for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them ; and the rock was Christ .
46:10:005:0	Nevertheless , with most of them God was not well-pleased ; for they were laid low in the wilderness .
46:10:006:0	Now these things happened as examples for us , so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved .
46:10:007:0	Do not be idolaters , as some of them were ; as it is written , “ The people sat down to eat and drink , and stood up to play . ”
46:10:008:0	Nor let us act immorally , as some of them did , and twenty-three thousand fell in one day .
46:10:009:0	Nor let us try the Lord , as some of them did , and were destroyed by the serpents .
46:10:010:0	Nor grumble , as some of them did , and were destroyed by the destroyer .
46:10:011:0	Now these things happened to them as an example , and they were written for our instruction , upon whom the ends of the ages have come .
46:10:012:0	Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall .
46:10:013:0	No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man ; and God is faithful , who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able , but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also , so that you will be able to endure it .
46:10:014:0	Therefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
46:10:015:0	I speak as to wise men ; you judge what I say .
46:10:016:0	Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ ?
46:10:017:0	Since there is one bread , we who are many are one body ; for we all partake of the one bread .
46:10:018:0	Look at the nation Israel ; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar ?
46:10:019:0	What do I mean then ? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
46:10:020:0	No , but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons and not to God ; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons .
46:10:021:0	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons ; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46:10:022:0	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? We are not stronger than He , are we ?
46:10:023:0	All things are lawful , but not all things are profitable . All things are lawful , but not all things edify .
46:10:024:0	Let no one seek his own good , but that of his neighbor .
46:10:025:0	Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience’ sake ;
46:10:026:0	for the earth is the Lord’s , and all it contains .
46:10:027:0	If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go , eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake .
46:10:028:0	But if anyone says to you , “ This is meat sacrificed to idols , ” do not eat it , for the sake of the one who informed you , and for conscience’ sake ;
46:10:029:0	I mean not your own conscience , but the other man’s ; for why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience ?
46:10:030:0	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks ?
46:10:031:0	Whether , then , you eat or drink or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46:10:032:0	Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God ;
46:10:033:0	just as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many , so that they may be saved .
