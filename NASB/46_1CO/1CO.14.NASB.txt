46:14:001:1	Prophecy a Superior Gift
46:14:001:0	Pursue love , yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts , but especially that you may prophesy .
46:14:002:0	For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God ; for no one understands , but in his spirit he speaks mysteries .
46:14:003:0	But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation .
46:14:004:0	One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself ; but one who prophesies edifies the church .
46:14:005:0	Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues , but even more that you would prophesy ; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues , unless he interprets , so that the church may receive edifying .
46:14:006:0	But now , brethren , if I come to you speaking in tongues , what will I profit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching ?
46:14:007:0	Yet even lifeless things , either flute or harp , in producing a sound , if they do not produce a distinction in the tones , how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp ?
46:14:008:0	For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?
46:14:009:0	So also you , unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear , how will it be known what is spoken ? For you will be speaking into the air .
46:14:010:0	There are , perhaps , a great many kinds of languages in the world , and no kind is without meaning .
46:14:011:0	If then I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian , and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me .
46:14:012:0	So also you , since you are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek to abound for the edification of the church .
46:14:013:0	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret .
46:14:014:0	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unfruitful .
46:14:015:0	What is the outcome then ? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also ; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also .
46:14:016:0	Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only , how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the “ Amen ” at your giving of thanks , since he does not know what you are saying ?
46:14:017:0	For you are giving thanks well enough , but the other person is not edified .
46:14:018:0	I thank God , I speak in tongues more than you all ;
46:14:002:1	Instruction for the Church
46:14:019:0	however , in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also , rather than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46:14:020:0	Brethren , do not be children in your thinking ; yet in evil be infants , but in your thinking be mature .
46:14:021:0	In the Law it is written , “ By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people , and even so they will not listen to Me , ” says the Lord .
46:14:022:0	So then tongues are for a sign , not to those who believe but to unbelievers ; but prophecy is for a sign , not to unbelievers but to those who believe .
46:14:023:0	Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues , and ungifted men or unbelievers enter , will they not say that you are mad ?
46:14:024:0	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters , he is convicted by all , he is called to account by all ;
46:14:025:0	the secrets of his heart are disclosed ; and so he will fall on his face and worship God , declaring that God is certainly among you .
46:14:026:0	What is the outcome then , brethren ? When you assemble , each one has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has a tongue , has an interpretation . Let all things be done for edification .
46:14:027:0	If anyone speaks in a tongue , it should be by two or at the most three , and each in turn , and one must interpret ;
46:14:028:0	but if there is no interpreter , he must keep silent in the church ; and let him speak to himself and to God .
46:14:029:0	Let two or three prophets speak , and let the others pass judgment .
46:14:030:0	But if a revelation is made to another who is seated , the first one must keep silent .
46:14:031:0	For you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all may be exhorted ;
46:14:032:0	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets ;
46:14:033:0	for God is not a God of confusion but of peace , as in all the churches of the saints .
46:14:034:0	The women are to keep silent in the churches ; for they are not permitted to speak , but are to subject themselves , just as the Law also says .
46:14:035:0	If they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church .
46:14:036:0	Was it from you that the word of God first went forth ? Or has it come to you only ?
46:14:037:0	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual , let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord’s commandment .
46:14:038:0	But if anyone does not recognize this , he is not recognized .
46:14:039:0	Therefore , my brethren , desire earnestly to prophesy , and do not forbid to speak in tongues .
46:14:040:0	But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner .
