25:4:001:1	Distress of the Siege Described
25:4:001:0	How dark the gold has become , How the pure gold has changed ! The sacred stones are poured outAt the corner of every street .
25:4:002:0	The precious sons of Zion , Weighed against fine gold , How they are regarded as earthen jars , The work of a potter’s hands !
25:4:003:0	Even jackals offer the breast , They nurse their young ; But the daughter of my people has become cruelLike ostriches in the wilderness .
25:4:004:0	The tongue of the infant cleavesTo the roof of its mouth because of thirst ; The little ones ask for bread , But no one breaks it for them .
25:4:005:0	Those who ate delicaciesAre desolate in the streets ; Those reared in purpleEmbrace ash pits .
25:4:006:0	For the iniquity of the daughter of my peopleIs greater than the sin of Sodom , Which was overthrown as in a moment , And no hands were turned toward her .
25:4:007:0	Her consecrated ones were purer than snow , They were whiter than milk ; They were more ruddy in body than corals , Their polishing was like lapis lazuli .
25:4:008:0	Their appearance is blacker than soot , They are not recognized in the streets ; Their skin is shriveled on their bones , It is withered , it has become like wood .
25:4:009:0	Better are those slain with the swordThan those slain with hunger ; For they pine away , being strickenFor lack of the fruits of the field .
25:4:010:0	The hands of compassionate womenBoiled their own children ; They became food for themBecause of the destruction of the daughter of my people .
25:4:011:0	The Lord has accomplished His wrath , He has poured out His fierce anger ; And He has kindled a fire in ZionWhich has consumed its foundations .
25:4:012:0	The kings of the earth did not believe , Nor did any of the inhabitants of the world , That the adversary and the enemyCould enter the gates of Jerusalem .
25:4:013:0	Because of the sins of her prophets And the iniquities of her priests , Who have shed in her midstThe blood of the righteous ;
25:4:014:0	They wandered , blind , in the streets ; They were defiled with bloodSo that no one could touch their garments .
25:4:015:0	“ Depart ! Unclean ! ” they cried of themselves . “ Depart , depart , do not touch ! ” So they fled and wandered ; Men among the nations said , “ They shall not continue to dwell with us . ”
25:4:016:0	The presence of the Lord has scattered them , He will not continue to regard them ; They did not honor the priests , They did not favor the elders .
25:4:017:0	Yet our eyes failed , Looking for help was useless ; In our watching we have watchedFor a nation that could not save .
25:4:018:0	They hunted our stepsSo that we could not walk in our streets ; Our end drew near , Our days were finishedFor our end had come .
25:4:019:0	Our pursuers were swifterThan the eagles of the sky ; They chased us on the mountains , They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness .
25:4:020:0	The breath of our nostrils , the Lord’s anointed , Was captured in their pits , Of whom we had said , “ Under his shadowWe shall live among the nations . ”
25:4:021:0	Rejoice and be glad , O daughter of Edom , Who dwells in the land of Uz ; But the cup will come around to you as well , You will become drunk and make yourself naked .
25:4:022:0	The punishment of your iniquity has been completed , O daughter of Zion ; He will exile you no longer . But He will punish your iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; He will expose your sins !
