25:2:001:1	God’s Anger over Israel
25:2:001:0	How the Lord has covered the daughter of ZionWith a cloud in His anger ! He has cast from heaven to earthThe glory of Israel , And has not remembered His footstoolIn the day of His anger .
25:2:002:0	The Lord has swallowed up ; He has not sparedAll the habitations of Jacob . In His wrath He has thrown downThe strongholds of the daughter of Judah ; He has brought them down to the ground ; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes .
25:2:003:0	In fierce anger He has cut offAll the strength of Israel ; He has drawn back His right handFrom before the enemy . And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fireConsuming round about .
25:2:004:0	He has bent His bow like an enemy ; He has set His right hand like an adversaryAnd slain all that were pleasant to the eye ; In the tent of the daughter of ZionHe has poured out His wrath like fire .
25:2:005:0	The Lord has become like an enemy . He has swallowed up Israel ; He has swallowed up all its palaces , He has destroyed its strongholdsAnd multiplied in the daughter of JudahMourning and moaning .
25:2:006:0	And He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden booth ; He has destroyed His appointed meeting place . The Lord has caused to be forgottenThe appointed feast and sabbath in Zion , And He has despised king and priestIn the indignation of His anger .
25:2:007:0	The Lord has rejected His altar , He has abandoned His sanctuary ; He has delivered into the hand of the enemyThe walls of her palaces . They have made a noise in the house of the LordAs in the day of an appointed feast .
25:2:008:0	The Lord determined to destroyThe wall of the daughter of Zion . He has stretched out a line , He has not restrained His hand from destroying , And He has caused rampart and wall to lament ; They have languished together .
25:2:009:0	Her gates have sunk into the ground , He has destroyed and broken her bars . Her king and her princes are among the nations ; The law is no more . Also , her prophets findNo vision from the Lord .
25:2:010:0	The elders of the daughter of ZionSit on the ground , they are silent . They have thrown dust on their heads ; They have girded themselves with sackcloth . The virgins of JerusalemHave bowed their heads to the ground .
25:2:011:0	My eyes fail because of tears , My spirit is greatly troubled ; My heart is poured out on the earthBecause of the destruction of the daughter of my people , When little ones and infants faintIn the streets of the city .
25:2:012:0	They say to their mothers , “ Where is grain and wine ? ” As they faint like a wounded manIn the streets of the city , As their life is poured outOn their mothers’ bosom .
25:2:013:0	How shall I admonish you ? To what shall I compare you , O daughter of Jerusalem ? To what shall I liken you as I comfort you , O virgin daughter of Zion ? For your ruin is as vast as the sea ; Who can heal you ?
25:2:014:0	Your prophets have seen for youFalse and foolish visions ; And they have not exposed your iniquitySo as to restore you from captivity , But they have seen for you false and misleading oracles .
25:2:015:0	All who pass along the wayClap their hands in derision at you ; They hiss and shake their headsAt the daughter of Jerusalem , “ Is this the city of which they said , ‘The perfection of beauty , A joy to all the earth’ ? ”
25:2:016:0	All your enemiesHave opened their mouths wide against you ; They hiss and gnash their teeth . They say , “ We have swallowed her up ! Surely this is the day for which we waited ; We have reached it , we have seen it . ”
25:2:017:0	The Lord has done what He purposed ; He has accomplished His wordWhich He commanded from days of old . He has thrown down without sparing , And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you ; He has exalted the might of your adversaries .
25:2:018:0	Their heart cried out to the Lord , “ O wall of the daughter of Zion , Let your tears run down like a river day and night ; Give yourself no relief , Let your eyes have no rest .
25:2:019:0	Arise , cry aloud in the nightAt the beginning of the night watches ; Pour out your heart like waterBefore the presence of the Lord ; Lift up your hands to HimFor the life of your little onesWho are faint because of hungerAt the head of every street . ”
25:2:020:0	See , O Lord , and look ! With whom have You dealt thus ? Should women eat their offspring , The little ones who were born healthy ? Should priest and prophet be slainIn the sanctuary of the Lord ?
25:2:021:0	On the ground in the streetsLie young and old ; My virgins and my young menHave fallen by the sword . You have slain them in the day of Your anger , You have slaughtered , not sparing .
25:2:022:0	You called as in the day of an appointed feastMy terrors on every side ; And there was no one who escaped or survivedIn the day of the Lord’s anger . Those whom I bore and reared , My enemy annihilated them .
