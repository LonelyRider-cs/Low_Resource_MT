25:1:001:1	The Sorrows of Zion
25:1:001:0	How lonely sits the cityThat was full of people ! She has become like a widowWho was once great among the nations ! She who was a princess among the provincesHas become a forced laborer !
25:1:002:0	She weeps bitterly in the nightAnd her tears are on her cheeks ; She has none to comfort herAmong all her lovers . All her friends have dealt treacherously with her ; They have become her enemies .
25:1:003:0	Judah has gone into exile under afflictionAnd under harsh servitude ; She dwells among the nations , But she has found no rest ; All her pursuers have overtaken herIn the midst of distress .
25:1:004:0	The roads of Zion are in mourningBecause no one comes to the appointed feasts . All her gates are desolate ; Her priests are groaning , Her virgins are afflicted , And she herself is bitter .
25:1:005:0	Her adversaries have become her masters , Her enemies prosper ; For the Lord has caused her griefBecause of the multitude of her transgressions ; Her little ones have gone awayAs captives before the adversary .
25:1:006:0	All her majestyHas departed from the daughter of Zion ; Her princes have become like deerThat have found no pasture ; And they have fled without strengthBefore the pursuer .
25:1:007:0	In the days of her affliction and homelessnessJerusalem remembers all her precious thingsThat were from the days of old , When her people fell into the hand of the adversaryAnd no one helped her . The adversaries saw her , They mocked at her ruin .
25:1:008:0	Jerusalem sinned greatly , Therefore she has become an unclean thing . All who honored her despise herBecause they have seen her nakedness ; Even she herself groans and turns away .
25:1:009:0	Her uncleanness was in her skirts ; She did not consider her future . Therefore she has fallen astonishingly ; She has no comforter . “ See , O Lord , my affliction , For the enemy has magnified himself ! ”
25:1:010:0	The adversary has stretched out his handOver all her precious things , For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary , The ones whom You commandedThat they should not enter into Your congregation .
25:1:011:0	All her people groan seeking bread ; They have given their precious things for foodTo restore their lives themselves . “ See , O Lord , and look , For I am despised . ”
25:1:012:0	“ Is it nothing to all you who pass this way ? Look and see if there is any pain like my painWhich was severely dealt out to me , Which the Lord inflicted on the day of His fierce anger .
25:1:013:0	From on high He sent fire into my bones , And it prevailed over them . He has spread a net for my feet ; He has turned me back ; He has made me desolate , Faint all day long .
25:1:014:0	The yoke of my transgressions is bound ; By His hand they are knit together . They have come upon my neck ; He has made my strength fail . The Lord has given me into the handsOf those against whom I am not able to stand .
25:1:015:0	The Lord has rejected all my strong menIn my midst ; He has called an appointed time against meTo crush my young men ; The Lord has trodden as in a wine pressThe virgin daughter of Judah .
25:1:016:0	For these things I weep ; My eyes run down with water ; Because far from me is a comforter , One who restores my soul . My children are desolateBecause the enemy has prevailed . ”
25:1:017:0	Zion stretches out her hands ; There is no one to comfort her ; The Lord has commanded concerning JacobThat the ones round about him should be his adversaries ; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them .
25:1:018:0	“ The Lord is righteous ; For I have rebelled against His command ; Hear now , all peoples , And behold my pain ; My virgins and my young menHave gone into captivity .
25:1:019:0	I called to my lovers , but they deceived me ; My priests and my elders perished in the cityWhile they sought food to restore their strength themselves .
25:1:020:0	See , O Lord , for I am in distress ; My spirit is greatly troubled ; My heart is overturned within me , For I have been very rebellious . In the street the sword slays ; In the house it is like death .
25:1:021:0	They have heard that I groan ; There is no one to comfort me ; All my enemies have heard of my calamity ; They are glad that You have done it . Oh , that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed , That they may become like me .
25:1:022:0	Let all their wickedness come before You ; And deal with them as You have dealt with meFor all my transgressions ; For my groans are many and my heart is faint . ”
