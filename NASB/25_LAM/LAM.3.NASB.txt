25:3:001:1	Jeremiah Shares Israel’s Affliction
25:3:001:0	I am the man who has seen afflictionBecause of the rod of His wrath .
25:3:002:0	He has driven me and made me walkIn darkness and not in light .
25:3:003:0	Surely against me He has turned His handRepeatedly all the day .
25:3:004:0	He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away , He has broken my bones .
25:3:005:0	He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship .
25:3:006:0	In dark places He has made me dwell , Like those who have long been dead .
25:3:007:0	He has walled me in so that I cannot go out ; He has made my chain heavy .
25:3:008:0	Even when I cry out and call for help , He shuts out my prayer .
25:3:009:0	He has blocked my ways with hewn stone ; He has made my paths crooked .
25:3:010:0	He is to me like a bear lying in wait , Like a lion in secret places .
25:3:011:0	He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces ; He has made me desolate .
25:3:012:0	He bent His bowAnd set me as a target for the arrow .
25:3:013:0	He made the arrows of His quiverTo enter into my inward parts .
25:3:014:0	I have become a laughingstock to all my people , Their mocking song all the day .
25:3:015:0	He has filled me with bitterness , He has made me drunk with wormwood .
25:3:016:0	He has broken my teeth with gravel ; He has made me cower in the dust .
25:3:017:0	My soul has been rejected from peace ; I have forgotten happiness .
25:3:002:1	Hope of Relief in God’s Mercy
25:3:018:0	So I say , “ My strength has perished , And so has my hope from the Lord . ”
25:3:019:0	Remember my affliction and my wandering , the wormwood and bitterness .
25:3:020:0	Surely my soul remembersAnd is bowed down within me .
25:3:021:0	This I recall to my mind , Therefore I have hope .
25:3:022:0	The Lord’s lovingkindnesses indeed never cease , For His compassions never fail .
25:3:023:0	They are new every morning ; Great is Your faithfulness .
25:3:024:0	“ The Lord is my portion , ” says my soul , “ Therefore I have hope in Him . ”
25:3:025:0	The Lord is good to those who wait for Him , To the person who seeks Him .
25:3:026:0	It is good that he waits silentlyFor the salvation of the Lord .
25:3:027:0	It is good for a man that he should bearThe yoke in his youth .
25:3:028:0	Let him sit alone and be silentSince He has laid it on him .
25:3:029:0	Let him put his mouth in the dust , Perhaps there is hope .
25:3:030:0	Let him give his cheek to the smiter , Let him be filled with reproach .
25:3:031:0	For the Lord will not reject forever ,
25:3:032:0	For if He causes grief , Then He will have compassionAccording to His abundant lovingkindness .
25:3:033:0	For He does not afflict willinglyOr grieve the sons of men .
25:3:034:0	To crush under His feetAll the prisoners of the land ,
25:3:035:0	To deprive a man of justiceIn the presence of the Most High ,
25:3:036:0	To defraud a man in his lawsuit—Of these things the Lord does not approve .
25:3:037:0	Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass , Unless the Lord has commanded it ?
25:3:038:0	Is it not from the mouth of the Most HighThat both good and ill go forth ?
25:3:039:0	Why should any living mortal , or any man , Offer complaint in view of his sins ?
25:3:040:0	Let us examine and probe our ways , And let us return to the Lord .
25:3:041:0	We lift up our heart and handsToward God in heaven ;
25:3:042:0	We have transgressed and rebelled , You have not pardoned .
25:3:043:0	You have covered Yourself with angerAnd pursued us ; You have slain and have not spared .
25:3:044:0	You have covered Yourself with a cloudSo that no prayer can pass through .
25:3:045:0	You have made us mere offscouring and refuseIn the midst of the peoples .
25:3:046:0	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
25:3:047:0	Panic and pitfall have befallen us , Devastation and destruction ;
25:3:048:0	My eyes run down with streams of waterBecause of the destruction of the daughter of my people .
25:3:049:0	My eyes pour down unceasingly , Without stopping ,
25:3:050:0	Until the Lord looks downAnd sees from heaven .
25:3:051:0	My eyes bring pain to my soulBecause of all the daughters of my city .
25:3:052:0	My enemies without causeHunted me down like a bird ;
25:3:053:0	They have silenced me in the pitAnd have placed a stone on me .
25:3:054:0	Waters flowed over my head ; I said , “ I am cut off ! ”
25:3:055:0	I called on Your name , O Lord , Out of the lowest pit .
25:3:056:0	You have heard my voice , “ Do not hide Your ear from my prayer for relief , From my cry for help . ”
25:3:057:0	You drew near when I called on You ; You said , “ Do not fear ! ”
25:3:058:0	O Lord , You have pleaded my soul’s cause ; You have redeemed my life .
25:3:059:0	O Lord , You have seen my oppression ; Judge my case .
25:3:060:0	You have seen all their vengeance , All their schemes against me .
25:3:061:0	You have heard their reproach , O Lord , All their schemes against me .
25:3:062:0	The lips of my assailants and their whispering Are against me all day long .
25:3:063:0	Look on their sitting and their rising ; I am their mocking song .
25:3:064:0	You will recompense them , O Lord , According to the work of their hands .
25:3:065:0	You will give them hardness of heart , Your curse will be on them .
25:3:066:0	You will pursue them in anger and destroy themFrom under the heavens of the Lord !
