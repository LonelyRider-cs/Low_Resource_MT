25:5:001:1	A Prayer for Mercy
25:5:001:0	Remember , O Lord , what has befallen us ; Look , and see our reproach !
25:5:002:0	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers , Our houses to aliens .
25:5:003:0	We have become orphans without a father , Our mothers are like widows .
25:5:004:0	We have to pay for our drinking water , Our wood comes to us at a price .
25:5:005:0	Our pursuers are at our necks ; We are worn out , there is no rest for us .
25:5:006:0	We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread .
25:5:007:0	Our fathers sinned , and are no more ; It is we who have borne their iniquities .
25:5:008:0	Slaves rule over us ; There is no one to deliver us from their hand .
25:5:009:0	We get our bread at the risk of our livesBecause of the sword in the wilderness .
25:5:010:0	Our skin has become as hot as an oven , Because of the burning heat of famine .
25:5:011:0	They ravished the women in Zion , The virgins in the cities of Judah .
25:5:012:0	Princes were hung by their hands ; Elders were not respected .
25:5:013:0	Young men worked at the grinding mill , And youths stumbled under loads of wood .
25:5:014:0	Elders are gone from the gate , Young men from their music .
25:5:015:0	The joy of our hearts has ceased ; Our dancing has been turned into mourning .
25:5:016:0	The crown has fallen from our head ; Woe to us , for we have sinned !
25:5:017:0	Because of this our heart is faint , Because of these things our eyes are dim ;
25:5:018:0	Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate , Foxes prowl in it .
25:5:019:0	You , O Lord , rule forever ; Your throne is from generation to generation .
25:5:020:0	Why do You forget us forever ? Why do You forsake us so long ?
25:5:021:0	Restore us to You , O Lord , that we may be restored ; Renew our days as of old ,
25:5:022:0	Unless You have utterly rejected us And are exceedingly angry with us .
