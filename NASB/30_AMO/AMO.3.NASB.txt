30:3:001:1	All the Tribes Are Guilty
30:3:001:0	Hear this word which the Lord has spoken against you , sons of Israel , against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt :
30:3:002:0	“ You only have I chosen among all the families of the earth ; Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities . ”
30:3:003:0	Do two men walk together unless they have made an appointment ?
30:3:004:0	Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey ? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured something ?
30:3:005:0	Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait in it ? Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all ?
30:3:006:0	If a trumpet is blown in a city will not the people tremble ? If a calamity occurs in a city has not the Lord done it ?
30:3:007:0	Surely the Lord God does nothingUnless He reveals His secret counselTo His servants the prophets .
30:3:008:0	A lion has roared ! Who will not fear ? The Lord God has spoken ! Who can but prophesy ?
30:3:009:0	Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt and say , “ Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see the great tumults within her and the oppressions in her midst .
30:3:010:0	But they do not know how to do what is right , ” declares the Lord , “ these who hoard up violence and devastation in their citadels . ”
30:3:011:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ An enemy , even one surrounding the land , Will pull down your strength from youAnd your citadels will be looted . ”
30:3:012:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion’s mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear , So will the sons of Israel dwelling in Samaria be snatched away—With the corner of a bed and the cover of a couch !
30:3:013:0	Hear and testify against the house of Jacob , ” Declares the Lord God , the God of hosts .
30:3:014:0	“ For on the day that I punish Israel’s transgressions , I will also punish the altars of Bethel ; The horns of the altar will be cut offAnd they will fall to the ground .
30:3:015:0	I will also smite the winter house together with the summer house ; The houses of ivory will also perishAnd the great houses will come to an end , ” Declares the Lord .
