30:8:001:1	Basket of Fruit and Israel’s Captivity
30:8:001:0	Thus the Lord God showed me , and behold , there was a basket of summer fruit .
30:8:002:0	He said , “ What do you see , Amos ? ” And I said , “ A basket of summer fruit . ” Then the Lord said to me , “ The end has come for My people Israel . I will spare them no longer .
30:8:003:0	The songs of the palace will turn to wailing in that day , ” declares the Lord God . “ Many will be the corpses ; in every place they will cast them forth in silence . ”
30:8:004:0	Hear this , you who trample the needy , to do away with the humble of the land ,
30:8:005:0	saying , “ When will the new moon be over , So that we may sell grain , And the sabbath , that we may open the wheat market , To make the bushel smaller and the shekel bigger , And to cheat with dishonest scales ,
30:8:006:0	So as to buy the helpless for moneyAnd the needy for a pair of sandals , And that we may sell the refuse of the wheat ? ”
30:8:007:0	The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob , “ Indeed , I will never forget any of their deeds .
30:8:008:0	Because of this will not the land quakeAnd everyone who dwells in it mourn ? Indeed , all of it will rise up like the Nile , And it will be tossed aboutAnd subside like the Nile of Egypt .
30:8:009:0	It will come about in that day , ” declares the Lord God , “ That I will make the sun go down at noonAnd make the earth dark in broad daylight .
30:8:010:0	Then I will turn your festivals into mourningAnd all your songs into lamentation ; And I will bring sackcloth on everyone’s loinsAnd baldness on every head . And I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son , And the end of it will be like a bitter day .
30:8:011:0	“ Behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord God , “ When I will send a famine on the land , Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water , But rather for hearing the words of the Lord .
30:8:012:0	People will stagger from sea to seaAnd from the north even to the east ; They will go to and fro to seek the word of the Lord , But they will not find it .
30:8:013:0	In that day the beautiful virginsAnd the young men will faint from thirst .
30:8:014:0	As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria , Who say , ‘As your god lives , O Dan , ’And , ‘As the way of Beersheba lives , ’They will fall and not rise again . ”
