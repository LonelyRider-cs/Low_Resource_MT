30:1:003:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of Damascus and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because they threshed Gilead with implements of sharp iron .
30:1:004:0	So I will send fire upon the house of HazaelAnd it will consume the citadels of Ben-hadad .
30:1:005:0	I will also break the gate bar of Damascus , And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven , And him who holds the scepter , from Beth-eden ; So the people of Aram will go exiled to Kir , ” Says the Lord .
30:1:006:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of Gaza and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because they deported an entire populationTo deliver it up to Edom .

30:1:008:0	I will also cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , And him who holds the scepter , from Ashkelon ; I will even unleash My power upon Ekron , And the remnant of the Philistines will perish , ” Says the Lord God .

30:1:011:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of Edom and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because he pursued his brother with the sword , While he stifled his compassion ; His anger also tore continually , And he maintained his fury forever .
30:1:012:0	So I will send fire upon TemanAnd it will consume the citadels of Bozrah . ”
30:1:013:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because they ripped open the pregnant women of GileadIn order to enlarge their borders .
