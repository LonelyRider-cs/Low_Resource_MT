30:5:001:1	“ Seek Me that You May Live ”
30:5:001:0	Hear this word which I take up for you as a dirge , O house of Israel :
30:5:002:0	She has fallen , she will not rise again—The virgin Israel . She lies neglected on her land ; There is none to raise her up .
30:5:003:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ The city which goes forth a thousand strongWill have a hundred left , And the one which goes forth a hundred strongWill have ten left to the house of Israel . ”
30:5:004:0	For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel , “ Seek Me that you may live .
30:5:005:0	But do not resort to BethelAnd do not come to Gilgal , Nor cross over to Beersheba ; For Gilgal will certainly go into captivityAnd Bethel will come to trouble .
30:5:006:0	Seek the Lord that you may live , Or He will break forth like a fire , O house of Joseph , And it will consume with none to quench it for Bethel ,
30:5:007:0	For those who turn justice into wormwoodAnd cast righteousness down to the earth . ”
30:5:008:0	He who made the Pleiades and OrionAnd changes deep darkness into morning , Who also darkens day into night , Who calls for the waters of the seaAnd pours them out on the surface of the earth , The Lord is His name .
30:5:009:0	It is He who flashes forth with destruction upon the strong , So that destruction comes upon the fortress .
30:5:010:0	They hate him who reproves in the gate , And they abhor him who speaks with integrity .
30:5:011:0	Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poorAnd exact a tribute of grain from them , Though you have built houses of well-hewn stone , Yet you will not live in them ; You have planted pleasant vineyards , yet you will not drink their wine .
30:5:012:0	For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are great , You who distress the righteous and accept bribesAnd turn aside the poor in the gate .
30:5:013:0	Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps silent , for it is an evil time .
30:5:014:0	Seek good and not evil , that you may live ; And thus may the Lord God of hosts be with you , Just as you have said !
30:5:015:0	Hate evil , love good , And establish justice in the gate ! Perhaps the Lord God of hostsMay be gracious to the remnant of Joseph .
30:5:016:0	Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts , the Lord , “ There is wailing in all the plazas , And in all the streets they say , ‘Alas ! Alas ! ’They also call the farmer to mourningAnd professional mourners to lamentation .
30:5:017:0	And in all the vineyards there is wailing , Because I will pass through the midst of you , ” says the Lord .
30:5:018:0	Alas , you who are longing for the day of the Lord , For what purpose will the day of the Lord be to you ? It will be darkness and not light ;
30:5:019:0	As when a man flees from a lionAnd a bear meets him , Or goes home , leans his hand against the wallAnd a snake bites him .
30:5:020:0	Will not the day of the Lord be darkness instead of light , Even gloom with no brightness in it ?
30:5:021:0	“ I hate , I reject your festivals , Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies .
30:5:022:0	Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings , I will not accept them ; And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings .
30:5:023:0	Take away from Me the noise of your songs ; I will not even listen to the sound of your harps .
30:5:024:0	But let justice roll down like watersAnd righteousness like an ever-flowing stream .
30:5:025:0	“ Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years , O house of Israel ?
30:5:026:0	You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun , your images , the star of your gods which you made for yourselves .
30:5:027:0	Therefore , I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus , ” says the Lord , whose name is the God of hosts .
