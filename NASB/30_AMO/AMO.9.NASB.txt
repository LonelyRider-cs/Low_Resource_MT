30:9:001:1	God’s Judgment Unavoidable
30:9:001:0	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar , and He said , “ Smite the capitals so that the thresholds will shake , And break them on the heads of them all ! Then I will slay the rest of them with the sword ; They will not have a fugitive who will flee , Or a refugee who will escape .
30:9:002:0	Though they dig into Sheol , From there will My hand take them ; And though they ascend to heaven , From there will I bring them down .
30:9:003:0	Though they hide on the summit of Carmel , I will search them out and take them from there ; And though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea , From there I will command the serpent and it will bite them .
30:9:004:0	And though they go into captivity before their enemies , From there I will command the sword that it slay them , And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good . ”
30:9:005:0	The Lord God of hosts , The One who touches the land so that it melts , And all those who dwell in it mourn , And all of it rises up like the NileAnd subsides like the Nile of Egypt ;
30:9:006:0	The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavensAnd has founded His vaulted dome over the earth , He who calls for the waters of the seaAnd pours them out on the face of the earth , The Lord is His name .
30:9:007:0	“ Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me , O sons of Israel ? ” declares the Lord . “ Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt , And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir ?
30:9:008:0	Behold , the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom , And I will destroy it from the face of the earth ; Nevertheless , I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob , ” Declares the Lord .
30:9:009:0	“ For behold , I am commanding , And I will shake the house of Israel among all nationsAs grain is shaken in a sieve , But not a kernel will fall to the ground .
30:9:002:1	The Restoration of Israel
30:9:010:0	All the sinners of My people will die by the sword , Those who say , ‘The calamity will not overtake or confront us . ’
30:9:011:0	“ In that day I will raise up the fallen booth of David , And wall up its breaches ; I will also raise up its ruinsAnd rebuild it as in the days of old ;
30:9:012:0	That they may possess the remnant of EdomAnd all the nations who are called by My name , ” Declares the Lord who does this .
30:9:013:0	“ Behold , days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ When the plowman will overtake the reaperAnd the treader of grapes him who sows seed ; When the mountains will drip sweet wineAnd all the hills will be dissolved .
30:9:014:0	Also I will restore the captivity of My people Israel , And they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them ; They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine , And make gardens and eat their fruit .
30:9:015:0	I will also plant them on their land , And they will not again be rooted out from their landWhich I have given them , ” Says the Lord your God .
