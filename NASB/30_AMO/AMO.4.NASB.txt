30:4:001:1	“ Yet You Have Not Returned to Me ”
30:4:001:0	Hear this word , you cows of Bashan who are on the mountain of Samaria , Who oppress the poor , who crush the needy , Who say to your husbands , “ Bring now , that we may drink ! ”
30:4:002:0	The Lord God has sworn by His holiness , “ Behold , the days are coming upon youWhen they will take you away with meat hooks , And the last of you with fish hooks .
30:4:003:0	You will go out through breaches in the walls , Each one straight before her , And you will be cast to Harmon , ” declares the Lord .
30:4:004:0	“ Enter Bethel and transgress ; In Gilgal multiply transgression ! Bring your sacrifices every morning , Your tithes every three days .
30:4:005:0	Offer a thank offering also from that which is leavened , And proclaim freewill offerings , make them known . For so you love to do , you sons of Israel , ” Declares the Lord God .
30:4:006:0	“ But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your citiesAnd lack of bread in all your places , Yet you have not returned to Me , ” declares the Lord .
30:4:007:0	“ Furthermore , I withheld the rain from youWhile there were still three months until harvest . Then I would send rain on one cityAnd on another city I would not send rain ; One part would be rained on , While the part not rained on would dry up .
30:4:008:0	So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water , But would not be satisfied ; Yet you have not returned to Me , ” declares the Lord .
30:4:009:0	“ I smote you with scorching wind and mildew ; And the caterpillar was devouringYour many gardens and vineyards , fig trees and olive trees ; Yet you have not returned to Me , ” declares the Lord .
30:4:010:0	“ I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt ; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses , And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils ; Yet you have not returned to Me , ” declares the Lord .
30:4:011:0	“ I overthrew you , as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah , And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze ; Yet you have not returned to Me , ” declares the Lord .
30:4:012:0	“ Therefore thus I will do to you , O Israel ; Because I will do this to you , Prepare to meet your God , O Israel . ”
30:4:013:0	For behold , He who forms mountains and creates the windAnd declares to man what are His thoughts , He who makes dawn into darknessAnd treads on the high places of the earth , The Lord God of hosts is His name .
