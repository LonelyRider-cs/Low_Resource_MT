30:6:001:1	“ Those at Ease in Zion ”
30:6:001:0	Woe to those who are at ease in ZionAnd to those who feel secure in the mountain of Samaria , The distinguished men of the foremost of nations , To whom the house of Israel comes .
30:6:002:0	Go over to Calneh and look , And go from there to Hamath the great , Then go down to Gath of the Philistines . Are they better than these kingdoms , Or is their territory greater than yours ?
30:6:003:0	Do you put off the day of calamity , And would you bring near the seat of violence ?
30:6:004:0	Those who recline on beds of ivoryAnd sprawl on their couches , And eat lambs from the flockAnd calves from the midst of the stall ,
30:6:005:0	Who improvise to the sound of the harp , And like David have composed songs for themselves ,
30:6:006:0	Who drink wine from sacrificial bowlsWhile they anoint themselves with the finest of oils , Yet they have not grieved over the ruin of Joseph .
30:6:007:0	Therefore , they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles , And the sprawlers’ banqueting will pass away .
30:6:008:0	The Lord God has sworn by Himself , the Lord God of hosts has declared : “ I loathe the arrogance of Jacob , And detest his citadels ; Therefore I will deliver up the city and all it contains . ”
30:6:009:0	And it will be , if ten men are left in one house , they will die .
30:6:010:0	Then one’s uncle , or his undertaker , will lift him up to carry out his bones from the house , and he will say to the one who is in the innermost part of the house , “ Is anyone else with you ? ” And that one will say , “ No one . ” Then he will answer , “ Keep quiet . For the name of the Lord is not to be mentioned . ”
30:6:011:0	For behold , the Lord is going to command that the great house be smashed to pieces and the small house to fragments .
30:6:012:0	Do horses run on rocks ? Or does one plow them with oxen ? Yet you have turned justice into poisonAnd the fruit of righteousness into wormwood ,
30:6:013:0	You who rejoice in Lodebar , And say , “ Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves ? ”
30:6:014:0	“ For behold , I am going to raise up a nation against you , O house of Israel , ” declares the Lord God of hosts , “ And they will afflict you from the entrance of HamathTo the brook of the Arabah . ”
