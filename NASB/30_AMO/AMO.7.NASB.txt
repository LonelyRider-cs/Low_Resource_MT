30:7:001:0	Thus the Lord God showed me , and behold , He was forming a locust-swarm when the spring crop began to sprout . And behold , the spring crop was after the king’s mowing .
30:7:002:0	And it came about , when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land , that I said , “ Lord God , please pardon ! How can Jacob stand , For he is small ? ”
30:7:003:0	The Lord changed His mind about this . “ It shall not be , ” said the Lord .
30:7:004:0	Thus the Lord God showed me , and behold , the Lord God was calling to contend with them by fire , and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farm land .
30:7:005:0	Then I said , “ Lord God , please stop ! How can Jacob stand , for he is small ? ”
30:7:006:0	The Lord changed His mind about this . “ This too shall not be , ” said the Lord God .
30:7:007:0	Thus He showed me , and behold , the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand .
30:7:008:0	The Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Amos ? ” And I said , “ A plumb line . ” Then the Lord said , “ Behold I am about to put a plumb lineIn the midst of My people Israel . I will spare them no longer .
30:7:002:1	Amos Accused , Answers
30:7:009:0	The high places of Isaac will be desolatedAnd the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste . Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword . ”
30:7:010:0	Then Amaziah , the priest of Bethel , sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , “ Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel ; the land is unable to endure all his words .
30:7:011:0	For thus Amos says , ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile . ’ ”
30:7:012:0	Then Amaziah said to Amos , “ Go , you seer , flee away to the land of Judah and there eat bread and there do your prophesying !
30:7:013:0	But no longer prophesy at Bethel , for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal residence . ”
30:7:014:0	Then Amos replied to Amaziah , “ I am not a prophet , nor am I the son of a prophet ; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs .
30:7:015:0	But the Lord took me from following the flock and the Lord said to me , ‘Go prophesy to My people Israel . ’
30:7:016:0	Now hear the word of the Lord : you are saying , ‘You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you speak against the house of Isaac . ’
30:7:017:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord , ‘Your wife will become a harlot in the city , your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword , your land will be parceled up by a measuring line and you yourself will die upon unclean soil . Moreover , Israel will certainly go from its land into exile . ’ ”
