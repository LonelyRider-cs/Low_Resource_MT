30:2:001:1	Judgment on Judah and Israel
30:2:001:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of Moab and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime .
30:2:002:0	So I will send fire upon MoabAnd it will consume the citadels of Kerioth ; And Moab will die amid tumult , With war cries and the sound of a trumpet .
30:2:003:0	I will also cut off the judge from her midstAnd slay all her princes with him , ” says the Lord .
30:2:004:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of Judah and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because they rejected the law of the LordAnd have not kept His statutes ; Their lies also have led them astray , Those after which their fathers walked .
30:2:005:0	So I will send fire upon JudahAnd it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem . ”
30:2:006:0	Thus says the Lord , “ For three transgressions of Israel and for fourI will not revoke its punishment , Because they sell the righteous for moneyAnd the needy for a pair of sandals .
30:2:007:0	These who pant after the very dust of the earth on the head of the helplessAlso turn aside the way of the humble ; And a man and his father resort to the same girlIn order to profane My holy name .
30:2:008:0	On garments taken as pledges they stretch out beside every altar , And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
30:2:009:0	“ Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them , Though his height was like the height of cedarsAnd he was strong as the oaks ; I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below .
30:2:010:0	It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt , And I led you in the wilderness forty yearsThat you might take possession of the land of the Amorite .
30:2:011:0	Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophetsAnd some of your young men to be Nazirites . Is this not so , O sons of Israel ? ” declares the Lord .
30:2:012:0	“ But you made the Nazirites drink wine , And you commanded the prophets saying , ‘You shall not prophesy ! ’
30:2:013:0	Behold , I am weighted down beneath youAs a wagon is weighted down when filled with sheaves .
30:2:014:0	Flight will perish from the swift , And the stalwart will not strengthen his power , Nor the mighty man save his life .
30:2:015:0	He who grasps the bow will not stand his ground , The swift of foot will not escape , Nor will he who rides the horse save his life .
30:2:016:0	Even the bravest among the warriors will flee naked in that day , ” declares the Lord .
