53:3:001:1	Exhortation
53:3:001:0	Finally , brethren , pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified , just as it did also with you ;
53:3:002:0	and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men ; for not all have faith .
53:3:003:0	But the Lord is faithful , and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one .
53:3:004:0	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you are doing and will continue to do what we command .
53:3:005:0	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ .
53:3:006:0	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us .
53:3:007:0	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example , because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you ,
53:3:008:0	nor did we eat anyoneâ€™s bread without paying for it , but with labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you ;
53:3:009:0	not because we do not have the right to this , but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you , so that you would follow our example .
53:3:010:0	For even when we were with you , we used to give you this order : if anyone is not willing to work , then he is not to eat , either .
53:3:011:0	For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life , doing no work at all , but acting like busybodies .
53:3:012:0	Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread .
53:3:013:0	But as for you , brethren , do not grow weary of doing good .
53:3:014:0	If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter , take special note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he will be put to shame .
53:3:015:0	Yet do not regard him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
53:3:016:0	Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance . The Lord be with you all !
53:3:017:0	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand , and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter ; this is the way I write .
53:3:018:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
