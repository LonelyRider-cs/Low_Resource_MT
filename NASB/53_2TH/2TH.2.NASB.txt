53:2:001:1	Man of Lawlessness
53:2:001:0	Now we request you , brethren , with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him ,
53:2:002:0	that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord has come .
53:2:003:0	Let no one in any way deceive you , for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first , and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the son of destruction ,
53:2:004:0	who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , displaying himself as being God .
53:2:005:0	Do you not remember that while I was still with you , I was telling you these things ?
53:2:006:0	And you know what restrains him now , so that in his time he will be revealed .
53:2:007:0	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work ; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way .
53:2:008:0	Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming ;
53:2:009:0	that is , the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan , with all power and signs and false wonders ,
53:2:010:0	and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish , because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved .
53:2:011:0	For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false ,
53:2:012:0	in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth , but took pleasure in wickedness .
53:2:013:0	But we should always give thanks to God for you , brethren beloved by the Lord , because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth .
53:2:014:0	It was for this He called you through our gospel , that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53:2:015:0	So then , brethren , stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught , whether by word of mouth or by letter from us .
53:2:016:0	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father , who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace ,
53:2:017:0	comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word .
