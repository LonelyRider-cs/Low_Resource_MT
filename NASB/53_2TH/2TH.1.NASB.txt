53:1:001:1	Thanksgiving for Faith and Perseverance
53:1:001:0	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53:1:002:0	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53:1:003:0	We ought always to give thanks to God for you , brethren , as is only fitting , because your faith is greatly enlarged , and the love of each one of you toward one another grows ever greater ;
53:1:004:0	therefore , we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure .
53:1:005:0	This is a plain indication of God’s righteous judgment so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which indeed you are suffering .
53:1:006:0	For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
53:1:007:0	and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire ,
53:1:008:0	dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
53:1:009:0	These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction , away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power ,
53:1:010:0	when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day , and to be marveled at among all who have believed—for our testimony to you was believed .
53:1:011:0	To this end also we pray for you always , that our God will count you worthy of your calling , and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power ,
53:1:012:0	so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you , and you in Him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
