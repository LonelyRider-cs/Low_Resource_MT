54:4:001:1	Apostasy
54:4:001:0	But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons ,
54:4:002:0	by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron ,
54:4:003:0	men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth .
54:4:004:0	For everything created by God is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude ;
54:4:002:1	A Good Ministerâ€™s Discipline
54:4:005:0	for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer .
54:4:006:0	In pointing out these things to the brethren , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following .
54:4:007:0	But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women . On the other hand , discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness ;
54:4:008:0	for bodily discipline is only of little profit , but godliness is profitable for all things , since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come .
54:4:009:0	It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance .
54:4:010:0	For it is for this we labor and strive , because we have fixed our hope on the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of believers .
54:4:011:0	Prescribe and teach these things .
54:4:012:0	Let no one look down on your youthfulness , but rather in speech , conduct , love , faith and purity , show yourself an example of those who believe .
54:4:013:0	Until I come , give attention to the public reading of Scripture , to exhortation and teaching .
54:4:014:0	Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you , which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery .
54:4:015:0	Take pains with these things ; be absorbed in them , so that your progress will be evident to all .
54:4:016:0	Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching ; persevere in these things , for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you .
