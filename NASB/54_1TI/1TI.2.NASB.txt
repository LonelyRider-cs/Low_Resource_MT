54:2:001:1	A Call to Prayer
54:2:001:0	First of all , then , I urge that entreaties and prayers , petitions and thanksgivings , be made on behalf of all men ,
54:2:002:0	for kings and all who are in authority , so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity .
54:2:003:0	This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior ,
54:2:004:0	who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
54:2:005:0	For there is one God , and one mediator also between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ,
54:2:006:0	who gave Himself as a ransom for all , the testimony given at the proper time .
54:2:007:0	For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54:2:002:1	Women Instructed
54:2:008:0	Therefore I want the men in every place to pray , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and dissension .
54:2:009:0	Likewise , I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing , modestly and discreetly , not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments ,
54:2:010:0	but rather by means of good works , as is proper for women making a claim to godliness .
54:2:011:0	A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness .
54:2:012:0	But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man , but to remain quiet .
54:2:013:0	For it was Adam who was first created , and then Eve .
54:2:014:0	And it was not Adam who was deceived , but the woman being deceived , fell into transgression .
54:2:015:0	But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint .
