54:1:001:1	Misleadings in Doctrine and Living
54:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior , and of Christ Jesus , who is our hope ,
54:1:002:0	To Timothy , my true child in the faith : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54:1:003:0	As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia , remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines ,
54:1:004:0	nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies , which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith .
54:1:005:0	But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
54:1:006:0	For some men , straying from these things , have turned aside to fruitless discussion ,
54:1:007:0	wanting to be teachers of the Law , even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions .
54:1:008:0	But we know that the Law is good , if one uses it lawfully ,
54:1:009:0	realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person , but for those who are lawless and rebellious , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers
54:1:010:0	and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching ,
54:1:011:0	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , with which I have been entrusted .
54:1:012:0	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has strengthened me , because He considered me faithful , putting me into service ,
54:1:013:0	even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor . Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief ;
54:1:014:0	and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant , with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus .
54:1:015:0	It is a trustworthy statement , deserving full acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , among whom I am foremost of all .
54:1:016:0	Yet for this reason I found mercy , so that in me as the foremost , Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life .
54:1:017:0	Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
54:1:018:0	This command I entrust to you , Timothy , my son , in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you , that by them you fight the good fight ,
54:1:019:0	keeping faith and a good conscience , which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith .
54:1:020:0	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have handed over to Satan , so that they will be taught not to blaspheme .
