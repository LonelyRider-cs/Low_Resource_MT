2:36:001:1	The Tabernacle Underwritten
2:36:001:0	“ Now Bezalel and Oholiab , and every skillful person in whom the Lord has put skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the construction of the sanctuary , shall perform in accordance with all that the Lord has commanded . ”
2:36:002:0	Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful person in whom the Lord had put skill , everyone whose heart stirred him , to come to the work to perform it .
2:36:003:0	They received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary . And they still continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning .
2:36:004:0	And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came , each from the work which he was performing ,
2:36:005:0	and they said to Moses , “ The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the Lord commanded us to perform . ”
2:36:006:0	So Moses issued a command , and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp , saying , “ Let no man or woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary . ” Thus the people were restrained from bringing any more .
2:36:002:1	Construction Proceeds
2:36:007:0	For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work , to perform it .
2:36:008:0	All the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains ; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet material , with cherubim , the work of a skillful workman , Bezalel made them .

2:36:012:0	He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set ; the loops were opposite each other .
2:36:013:0	He made fifty clasps of gold and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps , so the tabernacle was a unit .
2:36:014:0	Then he made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle ; he made eleven curtains in all .
2:36:015:0	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits and four cubits the width of each curtain ; the eleven curtains had the same measurements .
2:36:016:0	He joined five curtains by themselves and the other six curtains by themselves .

2:36:018:0	He made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together so that it would be a unit .
2:36:019:0	He made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red , and a covering of porpoise skins above .
2:36:020:0	Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood , standing upright .
2:36:021:0	Ten cubits was the length of each board and one and a half cubits the width of each board .
2:36:022:0	There were two tenons for each board , fitted to one another ; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle .
2:36:023:0	He made the boards for the tabernacle : twenty boards for the south side ;
2:36:024:0	and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons .
2:36:025:0	Then for the second side of the tabernacle , on the north side , he made twenty boards ,
2:36:026:0	and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board .
2:36:027:0	For the rear of the tabernacle , to the west , he made six boards .
2:36:028:0	He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear .
2:36:029:0	They were double beneath , and together they were complete to its top to the first ring ; thus he did with both of them for the two corners .
2:36:030:0	There were eight boards with their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets , two under every board .
2:36:031:0	Then he made bars of acacia wood , five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle ,
2:36:032:0	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear side to the west .
2:36:033:0	He made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end .
2:36:034:0	He overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
2:36:035:0	Moreover , he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet material , and fine twisted linen ; he made it with cherubim , the work of a skillful workman .
2:36:036:0	He made four pillars of acacia for it , and overlaid them with gold , with their hooks of gold ; and he cast four sockets of silver for them .
2:36:037:0	He made a screen for the doorway of the tent , of blue and purple and scarlet material , and fine twisted linen , the work of a weaver ;
2:36:038:0	and he made its five pillars with their hooks , and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold ; but their five sockets were of bronze .
