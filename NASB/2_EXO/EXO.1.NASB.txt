2:1:001:1	Israel Multiplies in Egypt
2:1:001:0	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob ; they came each one with his household :
2:1:002:0	Reuben , Simeon , Levi and Judah ;
2:1:003:0	Issachar , Zebulun and Benjamin ;
2:1:004:0	Dan and Naphtali , Gad and Asher .
2:1:005:0	All the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number , but Joseph was already in Egypt .
2:1:006:0	Joseph died , and all his brothers and all that generation .
2:1:007:0	But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly , and multiplied , and became exceedingly mighty , so that the land was filled with them .
2:1:008:0	Now a new king arose over Egypt , who did not know Joseph .
2:1:009:0	He said to his people , “ Behold , the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we .
2:1:010:0	Come , let us deal wisely with them , or else they will multiply and in the event of war , they will also join themselves to those who hate us , and fight against us and depart from the land . ”
2:1:011:0	So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor . And they built for Pharaoh storage cities , Pithom and Raamses .
2:1:012:0	But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out , so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel .
2:1:013:0	The Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously ;
2:1:014:0	and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of labor in the field , all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them .
2:1:015:0	Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives , one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other was named Puah ;
2:1:016:0	and he said , “ When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see them upon the birthstool , if it is a son , then you shall put him to death ; but if it is a daughter , then she shall live . ”
2:1:017:0	But the midwives feared God , and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them , but let the boys live .
2:1:018:0	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them , “ Why have you done this thing , and let the boys live ? ”
2:1:019:0	The midwives said to Pharaoh , “ Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them . ”
2:1:020:0	So God was good to the midwives , and the people multiplied , and became very mighty .
2:1:021:0	Because the midwives feared God , He established households for them .
2:1:022:0	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people , saying , “ Every son who is born you are to cast into the Nile , and every daughter you are to keep alive . ”
