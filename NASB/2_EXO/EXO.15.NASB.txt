2:15:001:1	The Song of Moses and Israel
2:15:001:0	Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord , and said , “ I will sing to the Lord , for He is highly exalted ; The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea .
2:15:002:0	The Lord is my strength and song , And He has become my salvation ; This is my God , and I will praise Him ; My father’s God , and I will extol Him .
2:15:003:0	The Lord is a warrior ; The Lord is His name .
2:15:004:0	Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea ; And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea .
2:15:005:0	The deeps cover them ; They went down into the depths like a stone .
2:15:006:0	Your right hand , O Lord , is majestic in power , Your right hand , O Lord , shatters the enemy .
2:15:007:0	And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You ; You send forth Your burning anger , and it consumes them as chaff .
2:15:008:0	At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up , The flowing waters stood up like a heap ; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea .
2:15:009:0	The enemy said , ‘I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; My desire shall be gratified against them ; I will draw out my sword , my hand will destroy them . ’
2:15:010:0	You blew with Your wind , the sea covered them ; They sank like lead in the mighty waters .
2:15:011:0	Who is like You among the gods , O Lord ? Who is like You , majestic in holiness , Awesome in praises , working wonders ?
2:15:012:0	You stretched out Your right hand , The earth swallowed them .
2:15:013:0	In Your lovingkindness You have led the people whom You have redeemed ; In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation .
2:15:014:0	The peoples have heard , they tremble ; Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia .
2:15:015:0	Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed ; The leaders of Moab , trembling grips them ; All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away .
2:15:016:0	Terror and dread fall upon them ; By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone ; Until Your people pass over , O Lord , Until the people pass over whom You have purchased .
2:15:017:0	You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance , The place , O Lord , which You have made for Your dwelling , The sanctuary , O Lord , which Your hands have established .
2:15:018:0	The Lord shall reign forever and ever . ”
2:15:019:0	For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea , and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea on them , but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea .
2:15:020:0	Miriam the prophetess , Aaron’s sister , took the timbrel in her hand , and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing .

2:15:004:1	Provides Water
2:15:021:0	Miriam answered them , “ Sing to the Lord , for He is highly exalted ; The horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea . ”
2:15:022:0	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water .
2:15:023:0	When they came to Marah , they could not drink the waters of Marah , for they were bitter ; therefore it was named Marah .
2:15:024:0	So the people grumbled at Moses , saying , “ What shall we drink ? ”
2:15:025:0	Then he cried out to the Lord , and the Lord showed him a tree ; and he threw it into the waters , and the waters became sweet . There He made for them a statute and regulation , and there He tested them .
2:15:026:0	And He said , “ If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the Lord your God , and do what is right in His sight , and give ear to His commandments , and keep all His statutes , I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians ; for I , the Lord , am your healer . ”
2:15:027:0	Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms , and they camped there beside the waters .
