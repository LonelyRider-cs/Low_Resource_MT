2:7:001:1	“ I Will Stretch Out My Hand ”
2:7:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ See , I make you as God to Pharaoh , and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet .
2:7:002:0	You shall speak all that I command you , and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land .
2:7:003:0	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt .
2:7:004:0	When Pharaoh does not listen to you , then I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts , My people the sons of Israel , from the land of Egypt by great judgments .
2:7:005:0	The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst . ”
2:7:006:0	So Moses and Aaron did it ; as the Lord commanded them , thus they did .
2:7:002:1	Aaron’s Rod Becomes a Serpent
2:7:007:0	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three , when they spoke to Pharaoh .
2:7:008:0	Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying ,
2:7:009:0	“ When Pharaoh speaks to you , saying , ‘Work a miracle , ’ then you shall say to Aaron , ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh , that it may become a serpent . ’ ”
2:7:010:0	So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh , and thus they did just as the Lord had commanded ; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants , and it became a serpent .
2:7:011:0	Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers , and they also , the magicians of Egypt , did the same with their secret arts .
2:7:012:0	For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents . But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs .
2:7:003:1	Water Is Turned to Blood
2:7:013:0	Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened , and he did not listen to them , as the Lord had said .
2:7:014:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn ; he refuses to let the people go .
2:7:015:0	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water , and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile ; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent .
2:7:016:0	You shall say to him , ‘The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , sent me to you , saying , “ Let My people go , that they may serve Me in the wilderness . But behold , you have not listened until now . ”
2:7:017:0	Thus says the Lord , “ By this you shall know that I am the Lord : behold , I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand , and it will be turned to blood .
2:7:018:0	The fish that are in the Nile will die , and the Nile will become foul , and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile . ” ’ ”
2:7:019:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Say to Aaron , ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt , over their rivers , over their streams , and over their pools , and over all their reservoirs of water , that they may become blood ; and there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt , both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone . ’ ”
2:7:020:0	So Moses and Aaron did even as the Lord had commanded . And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile , in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants , and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood .
2:7:021:0	The fish that were in the Nile died , and the Nile became foul , so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile . And the blood was through all the land of Egypt .
2:7:022:0	But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts ; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened , and he did not listen to them , as the Lord had said .
2:7:023:0	Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this .
2:7:024:0	So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink , for they could not drink of the water of the Nile .
2:7:025:0	Seven days passed after the Lord had struck the Nile .
