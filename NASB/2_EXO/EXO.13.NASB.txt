2:13:001:1	Consecration of the Firstborn
2:13:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:13:002:0	“ Sanctify to Me every firstborn , the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel , both of man and beast ; it belongs to Me . ”
2:13:003:0	Moses said to the people , “ Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt , from the house of slavery ; for by a powerful hand the Lord brought you out from this place . And nothing leavened shall be eaten .
2:13:004:0	On this day in the month of Abib , you are about to go forth .
2:13:005:0	It shall be when the Lord brings you to the land of the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Amorite , the Hivite and the Jebusite , which He swore to your fathers to give you , a land flowing with milk and honey , that you shall observe this rite in this month .
2:13:006:0	For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the Lord .
2:13:007:0	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days ; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you , nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders .
2:13:008:0	You shall tell your son on that day , saying , ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt . ’
2:13:009:0	And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand , and as a reminder on your forehead , that the law of the Lord may be in your mouth ; for with a powerful hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt .
2:13:010:0	Therefore , you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year .
2:13:011:0	“ Now when the Lord brings you to the land of the Canaanite , as He swore to you and to your fathers , and gives it to you ,
2:13:012:0	you shall devote to the Lord the first offspring of every womb , and the first offspring of every beast that you own ; the males belong to the Lord .
2:13:013:0	But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb , but if you do not redeem it , then you shall break its neck ; and every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem .
2:13:014:0	And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come , saying , ‘What is this ? ’ then you shall say to him , ‘With a powerful hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt , from the house of slavery .
2:13:015:0	It came about , when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go , that the Lord killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt , both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast . Therefore , I sacrifice to the Lord the males , the first offspring of every womb , but every firstborn of my sons I redeem . ’
2:13:002:1	God Leads the People
2:13:016:0	So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead , for with a powerful hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt . ”
2:13:017:0	Now when Pharaoh had let the people go , God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines , even though it was near ; for God said , “ The people might change their minds when they see war , and return to Egypt . ”
2:13:018:0	Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea ; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt .
2:13:019:0	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear , saying , “ God will surely take care of you , and you shall carry my bones from here with you . ”
2:13:020:0	Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness .
2:13:021:0	The Lord was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way , and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light , that they might travel by day and by night .
2:13:022:0	He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
