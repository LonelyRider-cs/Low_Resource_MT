2:6:001:1	God Promises Action
2:6:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh ; for under compulsion he will let them go , and under compulsion he will drive them out of his land . ”
2:6:002:0	God spoke further to Moses and said to him , “ I am the Lord ;
2:6:003:0	and I appeared to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , as God Almighty , but by My name , Lord , I did not make Myself known to them .
2:6:004:0	I also established My covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land in which they sojourned .
2:6:005:0	Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel , because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage , and I have remembered My covenant .
2:6:006:0	Say , therefore , to the sons of Israel , ‘I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will deliver you from their bondage . I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments .
2:6:007:0	Then I will take you for My people , and I will be your God ; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God , who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
2:6:008:0	I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and I will give it to you for a possession ; I am the Lord . ’ ”
2:6:009:0	So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel , but they did not listen to Moses on account of their despondency and cruel bondage .
2:6:010:0	Now the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:6:011:0	“ Go , tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land . ”
2:6:012:0	But Moses spoke before the Lord , saying , “ Behold , the sons of Israel have not listened to me ; how then will Pharaoh listen to me , for I am unskilled in speech ? ”
2:6:002:1	The Heads of Israel
2:6:013:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
2:6:014:0	These are the heads of their fathers’ households . The sons of Reuben , Israel’s firstborn : Hanoch and Pallu , Hezron and Carmi ; these are the families of Reuben .
2:6:015:0	The sons of Simeon : Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
2:6:016:0	These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations : Gershon and Kohath and Merari ; and the length of Levi’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years .
2:6:017:0	The sons of Gershon : Libni and Shimei , according to their families .
2:6:018:0	The sons of Kohath : Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel ; and the length of Kohath’s life was one hundred and thirty-three years .
2:6:019:0	The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . These are the families of the Levites according to their generations .
2:6:020:0	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed , and she bore him Aaron and Moses ; and the length of Amram’s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years .
2:6:021:0	The sons of Izhar : Korah and Nepheg and Zichri .
2:6:022:0	The sons of Uzziel : Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri .
2:6:023:0	Aaron married Elisheba , the daughter of Amminadab , the sister of Nahshon , and she bore him Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
2:6:024:0	The sons of Korah : Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph ; these are the families of the Korahites .
2:6:025:0	Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel , and she bore him Phinehas . These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites according to their families .
2:6:026:0	It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said , “ Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts . ”
2:6:027:0	They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt ; it was the same Moses and Aaron .
2:6:028:0	Now it came about on the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
2:6:029:0	that the Lord spoke to Moses , saying , “ I am the Lord ; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you . ”
2:6:030:0	But Moses said before the Lord , “ Behold , I am unskilled in speech ; how then will Pharaoh listen to me ? ”
