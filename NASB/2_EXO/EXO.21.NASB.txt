2:21:001:1	Ordinances for the People
2:21:001:0	“ Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them :
2:21:002:0	“ If you buy a Hebrew slave , he shall serve for six years ; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment .
2:21:003:0	If he comes alone , he shall go out alone ; if he is the husband of a wife , then his wife shall go out with him .
2:21:004:0	If his master gives him a wife , and she bears him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall belong to her master , and he shall go out alone .
2:21:005:0	But if the slave plainly says , ‘I love my master , my wife and my children ; I will not go out as a free man , ’
2:21:006:0	then his master shall bring him to God , then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost . And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl ; and he shall serve him permanently .
2:21:007:0	“ If a man sells his daughter as a female slave , she is not to go free as the male slaves do .
2:21:008:0	If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself , then he shall let her be redeemed . He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her .
2:21:009:0	If he designates her for his son , he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters .
2:21:010:0	If he takes to himself another woman , he may not reduce her food , her clothing , or her conjugal rights .
2:21:002:1	Personal Injuries
2:21:011:0	If he will not do these three things for her , then she shall go out for nothing , without payment of money .
2:21:012:0	“ He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death .
2:21:013:0	But if he did not lie in wait for him , but God let him fall into his hand , then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee .
2:21:014:0	If , however , a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor , so as to kill him craftily , you are to take him even from My altar , that he may die .
2:21:015:0	“ He who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death .
2:21:016:0	“ He who kidnaps a man , whether he sells him or he is found in his possession , shall surely be put to death .
2:21:017:0	“ He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death .
2:21:018:0	“ If men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist , and he does not die but remains in bed ,
2:21:019:0	if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff , then he who struck him shall go unpunished ; he shall only pay for his loss of time , and shall take care of him until he is completely healed .
2:21:020:0	“ If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand , he shall be punished .
2:21:021:0	If , however , he survives a day or two , no vengeance shall be taken ; for he is his property .
2:21:022:0	“ If men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely , yet there is no injury , he shall surely be fined as the woman’s husband may demand of him , and he shall pay as the judges decide .
2:21:023:0	But if there is any further injury , then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life ,
2:21:024:0	eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
2:21:025:0	burn for burn , wound for wound , bruise for bruise .
2:21:026:0	“ If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave , and destroys it , he shall let him go free on account of his eye .
2:21:027:0	And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave , he shall let him go free on account of his tooth .
2:21:028:0	“ If an ox gores a man or a woman to death , the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished .
2:21:029:0	If , however , an ox was previously in the habit of goring and its owner has been warned , yet he does not confine it and it kills a man or a woman , the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death .
2:21:030:0	If a ransom is demanded of him , then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded of him .
2:21:031:0	Whether it gores a son or a daughter , it shall be done to him according to the same rule .
2:21:032:0	If the ox gores a male or female slave , the owner shall give his or her master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
2:21:033:0	“ If a man opens a pit , or digs a pit and does not cover it over , and an ox or a donkey falls into it ,
2:21:034:0	the owner of the pit shall make restitution ; he shall give money to its owner , and the dead animal shall become his .
2:21:035:0	“ If one man’s ox hurts another’s so that it dies , then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally ; and also they shall divide the dead ox .
2:21:036:0	Or if it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring , yet its owner has not confined it , he shall surely pay ox for ox , and the dead animal shall become his .
