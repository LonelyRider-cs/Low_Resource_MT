2:30:001:1	The Altar of Incense
2:30:001:0	“ Moreover , you shall make an altar as a place for burning incense ; you shall make it of acacia wood .
2:30:002:0	Its length shall be a cubit , and its width a cubit , it shall be square , and its height shall be two cubits ; its horns shall be of one piece with it .
2:30:003:0	You shall overlay it with pure gold , its top and its sides all around , and its horns ; and you shall make a gold molding all around for it .
2:30:004:0	You shall make two gold rings for it under its molding ; you shall make them on its two side walls—on opposite sides—and they shall be holders for poles with which to carry it .
2:30:005:0	You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold .
2:30:006:0	You shall put this altar in front of the veil that is near the ark of the testimony , in front of the mercy seat that is over the ark of the testimony , where I will meet with you .
2:30:007:0	Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it ; he shall burn it every morning when he trims the lamps .
2:30:008:0	When Aaron trims the lamps at twilight , he shall burn incense . There shall be perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations .
2:30:009:0	You shall not offer any strange incense on this altar , or burnt offering or meal offering ; and you shall not pour out a drink offering on it .
2:30:010:0	Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year ; he shall make atonement on it with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once a year throughout your generations . It is most holy to the Lord . ”
2:30:011:0	The Lord also spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:30:012:0	“ When you take a census of the sons of Israel to number them , then each one of them shall give a ransom for himself to the Lord , when you number them , so that there will be no plague among them when you number them .
2:30:013:0	This is what everyone who is numbered shall give : half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary ( the shekel is twenty gerahs ) , half a shekel as a contribution to the Lord .
2:30:014:0	Everyone who is numbered , from twenty years old and over , shall give the contribution to the Lord .
2:30:015:0	The rich shall not pay more and the poor shall not pay less than the half shekel , when you give the contribution to the Lord to make atonement for yourselves .
2:30:016:0	You shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel and shall give it for the service of the tent of meeting , that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before the Lord , to make atonement for yourselves . ”
2:30:017:0	The Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:30:018:0	“ You shall also make a laver of bronze , with its base of bronze , for washing ; and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar , and you shall put water in it .
2:30:019:0	Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it ;
2:30:020:0	when they enter the tent of meeting , they shall wash with water , so that they will not die ; or when they approach the altar to minister , by offering up in smoke a fire sacrifice to the Lord .
2:30:002:1	The Anointing Oil
2:30:021:0	So they shall wash their hands and their feet , so that they will not die ; and it shall be a perpetual statute for them , for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations . ”
2:30:022:0	Moreover , the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:30:023:0	“ Take also for yourself the finest of spices : of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels , and of fragrant cinnamon half as much , two hundred and fifty , and of fragrant cane two hundred and fifty ,
2:30:024:0	and of cassia five hundred , according to the shekel of the sanctuary , and of olive oil a hin .
2:30:025:0	You shall make of these a holy anointing oil , a perfume mixture , the work of a perfumer ; it shall be a holy anointing oil .
2:30:026:0	With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony ,
2:30:027:0	and the table and all its utensils , and the lampstand and its utensils , and the altar of incense ,
2:30:028:0	and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils , and the laver and its stand .
2:30:029:0	You shall also consecrate them , that they may be most holy ; whatever touches them shall be holy .
2:30:030:0	You shall anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister as priests to Me .
2:30:031:0	You shall speak to the sons of Israel , saying , ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations .
2:30:032:0	It shall not be poured on anyone’s body , nor shall you make any like it in the same proportions ; it is holy , and it shall be holy to you .
2:30:003:1	The Incense
2:30:033:0	Whoever shall mix any like it or whoever puts any of it on a layman shall be cut off from his people . ’ ”
2:30:034:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Take for yourself spices , stacte and onycha and galbanum , spices with pure frankincense ; there shall be an equal part of each .
2:30:035:0	With it you shall make incense , a perfume , the work of a perfumer , salted , pure , and holy .
2:30:036:0	You shall beat some of it very fine , and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you ; it shall be most holy to you .
2:30:037:0	The incense which you shall make , you shall not make in the same proportions for yourselves ; it shall be holy to you for the Lord .
2:30:038:0	Whoever shall make any like it , to use as perfume , shall be cut off from his people . ”
