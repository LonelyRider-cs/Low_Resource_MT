2:34:001:1	The Two Tablets Replaced
2:34:001:0	Now the Lord said to Moses , “ Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones , and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered .
2:34:002:0	So be ready by morning , and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai , and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain .
2:34:003:0	No man is to come up with you , nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain ; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain . ”
2:34:004:0	So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones , and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , and he took two stone tablets in his hand .
2:34:005:0	The Lord descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the Lord .
2:34:006:0	Then the Lord passed by in front of him and proclaimed , “ The Lord , the Lord God , compassionate and gracious , slow to anger , and abounding in lovingkindness and truth ;
2:34:007:0	who keeps lovingkindness for thousands , who forgives iniquity , transgression and sin ; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished , visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations . ”
2:34:008:0	Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship .
2:34:002:1	The Covenant Renewed
2:34:009:0	He said , “ If now I have found favor in Your sight , O Lord , I pray , let the Lord go along in our midst , even though the people are so obstinate , and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us as Your own possession . ”
2:34:010:0	Then God said , “ Behold , I am going to make a covenant . Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations ; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the Lord , for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you .
2:34:011:0	“ Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day : behold , I am going to drive out the Amorite before you , and the Canaanite , the Hittite , the Perizzite , the Hivite and the Jebusite .
2:34:012:0	Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going , or it will become a snare in your midst .
2:34:013:0	But rather , you are to tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim
2:34:014:0	—for you shall not worship any other god , for the Lord , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous God—
2:34:015:0	otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods , and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice ,
2:34:016:0	and you might take some of his daughters for your sons , and his daughters might play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons also to play the harlot with their gods .
2:34:017:0	You shall make for yourself no molten gods .
2:34:018:0	“ You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread . For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the appointed time in the month of Abib , for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt .
2:34:019:0	“ The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me , and all your male livestock , the first offspring from cattle and sheep .
2:34:020:0	You shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from a donkey ; and if you do not redeem it , then you shall break its neck . You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons . None shall appear before Me empty-handed .
2:34:021:0	“ You shall work six days , but on the seventh day you shall rest ; even during plowing time and harvest you shall rest .
2:34:022:0	You shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks , that is , the first fruits of the wheat harvest , and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year .
2:34:023:0	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord God , the God of Israel .
2:34:024:0	For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders , and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the Lord your God .
2:34:025:0	“ You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread , nor is the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover to be left over until morning .
2:34:026:0	“ You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of the Lord your God . “ You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk . ”
2:34:027:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write down these words , for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel . ”
2:34:003:1	Moses’ Face Shines
2:34:028:0	So he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights ; he did not eat bread or drink water . And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant , the Ten Commandments .
2:34:029:0	It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai ( and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses’ hand as he was coming down from the mountain ) , that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him .
2:34:030:0	So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone , and they were afraid to come near him .
2:34:031:0	Then Moses called to them , and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him ; and Moses spoke to them .
2:34:032:0	Afterward all the sons of Israel came near , and he commanded them to do everything that the Lord had spoken to him on Mount Sinai .
2:34:033:0	When Moses had finished speaking with them , he put a veil over his face .
2:34:034:0	But whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him , he would take off the veil until he came out ; and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded ,
2:34:035:0	the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses’ face shone . So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him .
