2:4:001:1	Moses Given Powers
2:4:001:0	Then Moses said , “ What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say ? For they may say , ‘The Lord has not appeared to you . ’ ”
2:4:002:0	The Lord said to him , “ What is that in your hand ? ” And he said , “ A staff . ”
2:4:003:0	Then He said , “ Throw it on the ground . ” So he threw it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from it .
2:4:004:0	But the Lord said to Moses , “ Stretch out your hand and grasp it by its tail ” —so he stretched out his hand and caught it , and it became a staff in his hand—
2:4:005:0	“ that they may believe that the Lord , the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has appeared to you . ”
2:4:006:0	The Lord furthermore said to him , “ Now put your hand into your bosom . ” So he put his hand into his bosom , and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous like snow .
2:4:007:0	Then He said , “ Put your hand into your bosom again . ” So he put his hand into his bosom again , and when he took it out of his bosom , behold , it was restored like the rest of his flesh .
2:4:008:0	“ If they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign , they may believe the witness of the last sign .
2:4:009:0	But if they will not believe even these two signs or heed what you say , then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground ; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground . ”
2:4:010:0	Then Moses said to the Lord , “ Please , Lord , I have never been eloquent , neither recently nor in time past , nor since You have spoken to Your servant ; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue . ”
2:4:011:0	The Lord said to him , “ Who has made man’s mouth ? Or who makes him mute or deaf , or seeing or blind ? Is it not I , the Lord ?
2:4:012:0	Now then go , and I , even I , will be with your mouth , and teach you what you are to say . ”
2:4:002:1	Aaron to Be Moses’ Mouthpiece
2:4:013:0	But he said , “ Please , Lord , now send the message by whomever You will . ”
2:4:014:0	Then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses , and He said , “ Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite ? I know that he speaks fluently . And moreover , behold , he is coming out to meet you ; when he sees you , he will be glad in his heart .
2:4:015:0	You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth ; and I , even I , will be with your mouth and his mouth , and I will teach you what you are to do .
2:4:016:0	Moreover , he shall speak for you to the people ; and he will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him .
2:4:017:0	You shall take in your hand this staff , with which you shall perform the signs . ”
2:4:018:0	Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him , “ Please , let me go , that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt , and see if they are still alive . ” And Jethro said to Moses , “ Go in peace . ”
2:4:019:0	Now the Lord said to Moses in Midian , “ Go back to Egypt , for all the men who were seeking your life are dead . ”
2:4:020:0	So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey , and returned to the land of Egypt . Moses also took the staff of God in his hand .
2:4:021:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power ; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go .
2:4:022:0	Then you shall say to Pharaoh , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Israel is My son , My firstborn .
2:4:023:0	So I said to you , ‘Let My son go that he may serve Me’ ; but you have refused to let him go . Behold , I will kill your son , your firstborn . ” ’ ”
2:4:024:0	Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the Lord met him and sought to put him to death .
2:4:025:0	Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet , and she said , “ You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me . ”
2:4:026:0	So He let him alone . At that time she said , “ You are a bridegroom of blood ” —because of the circumcision .
2:4:027:0	Now the Lord said to Aaron , “ Go to meet Moses in the wilderness . ” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him .
2:4:028:0	Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him , and all the signs that He had commanded him to do .
2:4:029:0	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel ;
2:4:030:0	and Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses . He then performed the signs in the sight of the people .
2:4:031:0	So the people believed ; and when they heard that the Lord was concerned about the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction , then they bowed low and worshiped .
