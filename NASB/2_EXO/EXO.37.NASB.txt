2:37:001:1	Construction Continues
2:37:001:0	Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood ; its length was two and a half cubits , and its width one and a half cubits , and its height one and a half cubits ;
2:37:002:0	and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out , and made a gold molding for it all around .
2:37:003:0	He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet ; even two rings on one side of it , and two rings on the other side of it .
2:37:004:0	He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold .
2:37:005:0	He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark , to carry it .
2:37:006:0	He made a mercy seat of pure gold , two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide .
2:37:007:0	He made two cherubim of gold ; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat ;
2:37:008:0	one cherub at the one end and one cherub at the other end ; he made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at the two ends .
2:37:009:0	The cherubim had their wings spread upward , covering the mercy seat with their wings , with their faces toward each other ; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat .
2:37:010:0	Then he made the table of acacia wood , two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high .
2:37:011:0	He overlaid it with pure gold , and made a gold molding for it all around .
2:37:012:0	He made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around , and made a gold molding for its rim all around .
2:37:013:0	He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet .
2:37:014:0	Close by the rim were the rings , the holders for the poles to carry the table .
2:37:015:0	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold , to carry the table .
2:37:016:0	He made the utensils which were on the table , its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars , with which to pour out drink offerings , of pure gold .
2:37:017:0	Then he made the lampstand of pure gold . He made the lampstand of hammered work , its base and its shaft ; its cups , its bulbs and its flowers were of one piece with it .
2:37:018:0	There were six branches going out of its sides ; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it ;
2:37:019:0	three cups shaped like almond blossoms , a bulb and a flower in one branch , and three cups shaped like almond blossoms , a bulb and a flower in the other branch—so for the six branches going out of the lampstand .
2:37:020:0	In the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms , its bulbs and its flowers ;
2:37:021:0	and a bulb was under the first pair of branches coming out of it , and a bulb under the second pair of branches coming out of it , and a bulb under the third pair of branches coming out of it , for the six branches coming out of the lampstand .
2:37:022:0	Their bulbs and their branches were of one piece with it ; the whole of it was a single hammered work of pure gold .
2:37:023:0	He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold .
2:37:024:0	He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold .
2:37:025:0	Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood : a cubit long and a cubit wide , square , and two cubits high ; its horns were of one piece with it .
2:37:026:0	He overlaid it with pure gold , its top and its sides all around , and its horns ; and he made a gold molding for it all around .
2:37:027:0	He made two golden rings for it under its molding , on its two sides—on opposite sides—as holders for poles with which to carry it .
2:37:028:0	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold .
2:37:029:0	And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure , fragrant incense of spices , the work of a perfumer .
