2:11:001:1	The Last Plague
2:11:001:0	Now the Lord said to Moses , “ One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt ; after that he will let you go from here . When he lets you go , he will surely drive you out from here completely .
2:11:002:0	Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold . ”
2:11:003:0	The Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . Furthermore , the man Moses himself was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt , both in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people .
2:11:004:0	Moses said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt ,
2:11:005:0	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne , even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones ; all the firstborn of the cattle as well .
2:11:006:0	Moreover , there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again .
2:11:007:0	But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark , whether against man or beast , that you may understand how the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel . ’
2:11:008:0	All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me , saying , ‘Go out , you and all the people who follow you , ’ and after that I will go out . ” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger .
2:11:009:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh will not listen to you , so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt . ”
2:11:010:0	Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh ; yet the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart , and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land .
