2:16:001:0	Then they set out from Elim , and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt .
2:16:002:0	The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness .
2:16:003:0	The sons of Israel said to them , “ Would that we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the pots of meat , when we ate bread to the full ; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger . ”
2:16:004:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Behold , I will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day , that I may test them , whether or not they will walk in My instruction .
2:16:005:0	On the sixth day , when they prepare what they bring in , it will be twice as much as they gather daily . ”
2:16:006:0	So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel , “ At evening you will know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt ;

2:16:007:0	and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord , for He hears your grumblings against the Lord ; and what are we , that you grumble against us ? ”
2:16:008:0	Moses said , “ This will happen when the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening , and bread to the full in the morning ; for the Lord hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him . And what are we ? Your grumblings are not against us but against the Lord . ”
2:16:009:0	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel , ‘Come near before the Lord , for He has heard your grumblings . ’ ”
2:16:010:0	It came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
2:16:011:0	And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:16:012:0	“ I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel ; speak to them , saying , ‘At twilight you shall eat meat , and in the morning you shall be filled with bread ; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God . ’ ”
2:16:013:0	So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp , and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp .
2:16:014:0	When the layer of dew evaporated , behold , on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing , fine as the frost on the ground .
2:16:015:0	When the sons of Israel saw it , they said to one another , “ What is it ? ” For they did not know what it was . And Moses said to them , “ It is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat .
2:16:016:0	This is what the Lord has commanded , ‘Gather of it every man as much as he should eat ; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent . ’ ”
2:16:017:0	The sons of Israel did so , and some gathered much and some little .
2:16:018:0	When they measured it with an omer , he who had gathered much had no excess , and he who had gathered little had no lack ; every man gathered as much as he should eat .
2:16:019:0	Moses said to them , “ Let no man leave any of it until morning . ”
2:16:020:0	But they did not listen to Moses , and some left part of it until morning , and it bred worms and became foul ; and Moses was angry with them .
2:16:007:1	The Sabbath Observed
2:16:021:0	They gathered it morning by morning , every man as much as he should eat ; but when the sun grew hot , it would melt .
2:16:022:0	Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for each one . When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses ,
2:16:023:0	then he said to them , “ This is what the Lord meant : Tomorrow is a sabbath observance , a holy sabbath to the Lord . Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil , and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning . ”
2:16:024:0	So they put it aside until morning , as Moses had ordered , and it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it .
2:16:025:0	Moses said , “ Eat it today , for today is a sabbath to the Lord ; today you will not find it in the field .
2:16:026:0	Six days you shall gather it , but on the seventh day , the sabbath , there will be none . ”
2:16:027:0	It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather , but they found none .
2:16:028:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions ?
2:16:029:0	See , the Lord has given you the sabbath ; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day . Remain every man in his place ; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day . ”
2:16:030:0	So the people rested on the seventh day .
2:16:031:0	The house of Israel named it manna , and it was like coriander seed , white , and its taste was like wafers with honey .
2:16:032:0	Then Moses said , “ This is what the Lord has commanded , ‘Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations , that they may see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you out of the land of Egypt . ’ ”
2:16:033:0	Moses said to Aaron , “ Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it , and place it before the Lord to be kept throughout your generations . ”
2:16:034:0	As the Lord commanded Moses , so Aaron placed it before the Testimony , to be kept .
2:16:035:0	The sons of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came to an inhabited land ; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan .
2:16:036:0	( Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah . )
