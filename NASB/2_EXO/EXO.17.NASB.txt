2:17:001:1	Water in the Rock
2:17:001:0	Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin , according to the command of the Lord , and camped at Rephidim , and there was no water for the people to drink .
2:17:002:0	Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said , “ Give us water that we may drink . ” And Moses said to them , “ Why do you quarrel with me ? Why do you test the Lord ? ”
2:17:003:0	But the people thirsted there for water ; and they grumbled against Moses and said , “ Why , now , have you brought us up from Egypt , to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst ? ”
2:17:004:0	So Moses cried out to the Lord , saying , “ What shall I do to this people ? A little more and they will stone me . ”
2:17:005:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel ; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile , and go .
2:17:006:0	Behold , I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb ; and you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . ” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
2:17:002:1	Amalek Fought
2:17:007:0	He named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel , and because they tested the Lord , saying , “ Is the Lord among us , or not ? ”
2:17:008:0	Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim .
2:17:009:0	So Moses said to Joshua , “ Choose men for us and go out , fight against Amalek . Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand . ”
2:17:010:0	Joshua did as Moses told him , and fought against Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
2:17:011:0	So it came about when Moses held his hand up , that Israel prevailed , and when he let his hand down , Amalek prevailed .
2:17:012:0	But Moses’ hands were heavy . Then they took a stone and put it under him , and he sat on it ; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands , one on one side and one on the other . Thus his hands were steady until the sun set .
2:17:013:0	So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
2:17:014:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua , that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven . ”
2:17:015:0	Moses built an altar and named it The Lord is My Banner ;
2:17:016:0	and he said , “ The Lord has sworn ; the Lord will have war against Amalek from generation to generation . ”
