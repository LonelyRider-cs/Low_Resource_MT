2:24:001:1	People Affirm Their Covenant with God
2:24:001:0	Then He said to Moses , “ Come up to the Lord , you and Aaron , Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel , and you shall worship at a distance .
2:24:002:0	Moses alone , however , shall come near to the Lord , but they shall not come near , nor shall the people come up with him . ”
2:24:003:0	Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the Lord and all the ordinances ; and all the people answered with one voice and said , “ All the words which the Lord has spoken we will do ! ”
2:24:004:0	Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord . Then he arose early in the morning , and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel .
2:24:005:0	He sent young men of the sons of Israel , and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the Lord .
2:24:006:0	Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins , and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
2:24:007:0	Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people ; and they said , “ All that the Lord has spoken we will do , and we will be obedient ! ”
2:24:008:0	So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people , and said , “ Behold the blood of the covenant , which the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words . ”
2:24:009:0	Then Moses went up with Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ,
2:24:010:0	and they saw the God of Israel ; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire , as clear as the sky itself .
2:24:011:0	Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel ; and they saw God , and they ate and drank .
2:24:012:0	Now the Lord said to Moses , “ Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there , and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction . ”
2:24:013:0	So Moses arose with Joshua his servant , and Moses went up to the mountain of God .
2:24:014:0	But to the elders he said , “ Wait here for us until we return to you . And behold , Aaron and Hur are with you ; whoever has a legal matter , let him approach them . ”
2:24:015:0	Then Moses went up to the mountain , and the cloud covered the mountain .
2:24:016:0	The glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it for six days ; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud .
2:24:017:0	And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on the mountain top .
2:24:018:0	Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .
