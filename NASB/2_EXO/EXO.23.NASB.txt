2:23:001:1	Sundry Laws
2:23:001:0	“ You shall not bear a false report ; do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness .
2:23:002:0	You shall not follow the masses in doing evil , nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert justice ;
2:23:003:0	nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute .
2:23:004:0	“ If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey wandering away , you shall surely return it to him .
2:23:005:0	If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless under its load , you shall refrain from leaving it to him , you shall surely release it with him .
2:23:006:0	“ You shall not pervert the justice due to your needy brother in his dispute .
2:23:007:0	Keep far from a false charge , and do not kill the innocent or the righteous , for I will not acquit the guilty .
2:23:008:0	“ You shall not take a bribe , for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just .
2:23:002:1	The Sabbath and Land
2:23:009:0	“ You shall not oppress a stranger , since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger , for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt .
2:23:010:0	“ You shall sow your land for six years and gather in its yield ,
2:23:011:0	but on the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow , so that the needy of your people may eat ; and whatever they leave the beast of the field may eat . You are to do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove .
2:23:012:0	“ Six days you are to do your work , but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor so that your ox and your donkey may rest , and the son of your female slave , as well as your stranger , may refresh themselves .
2:23:003:1	Three National Feasts
2:23:013:0	Now concerning everything which I have said to you , be on your guard ; and do not mention the name of other gods , nor let them be heard from your mouth .
2:23:014:0	“ Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to Me .
2:23:015:0	You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread ; for seven days you are to eat unleavened bread , as I commanded you , at the appointed time in the month Abib , for in it you came out of Egypt . And none shall appear before Me empty-handed .
2:23:016:0	Also you shall observe the Feast of the Harvest of the first fruits of your labors from what you sow in the field ; also the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in the fruit of your labors from the field .
2:23:017:0	Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord God .
2:23:018:0	“ You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread ; nor is the fat of My feast to remain overnight until morning .
2:23:004:1	Conquest of the Land
2:23:019:0	“ You shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the Lord your God . “ You are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother .
2:23:020:0	“ Behold , I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared .
2:23:021:0	Be on your guard before him and obey his voice ; do not be rebellious toward him , for he will not pardon your transgression , since My name is in him .
2:23:022:0	But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say , then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries .
2:23:023:0	For My angel will go before you and bring you in to the land of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Canaanites , the Hivites and the Jebusites ; and I will completely destroy them .
2:23:024:0	You shall not worship their gods , nor serve them , nor do according to their deeds ; but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their sacred pillars in pieces .
2:23:025:0	But you shall serve the Lord your God , and He will bless your bread and your water ; and I will remove sickness from your midst .
2:23:026:0	There shall be no one miscarrying or barren in your land ; I will fulfill the number of your days .
2:23:027:0	I will send My terror ahead of you , and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come , and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you .
2:23:028:0	I will send hornets ahead of you so that they will drive out the Hivites , the Canaanites , and the Hittites before you .
2:23:029:0	I will not drive them out before you in a single year , that the land may not become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you .
2:23:030:0	I will drive them out before you little by little , until you become fruitful and take possession of the land .
2:23:031:0	I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines , and from the wilderness to the River Euphrates ; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand , and you will drive them out before you .
2:23:032:0	You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods .
2:23:033:0	They shall not live in your land , because they will make you sin against Me ; for if you serve their gods , it will surely be a snare to you . ”
