2:40:001:1	The Tabernacle Erected
2:40:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
2:40:002:0	“ On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting .
2:40:003:0	You shall place the ark of the testimony there , and you shall screen the ark with the veil .
2:40:004:0	You shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it ; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps .
2:40:005:0	Moreover , you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony , and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle .
2:40:006:0	You shall set the altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting .
2:40:007:0	You shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it .
2:40:008:0	You shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court .
2:40:009:0	Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it , and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings ; and it shall be holy .
2:40:010:0	You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils , and consecrate the altar , and the altar shall be most holy .
2:40:011:0	You shall anoint the laver and its stand , and consecrate it .
2:40:012:0	Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water .
2:40:013:0	You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him , that he may minister as a priest to Me .
2:40:014:0	You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them ;
2:40:015:0	and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father , that they may minister as priests to Me ; and their anointing will qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations . ”
2:40:016:0	Thus Moses did ; according to all that the Lord had commanded him , so he did .
2:40:017:0	Now in the first month of the second year , on the first day of the month , the tabernacle was erected .
2:40:018:0	Moses erected the tabernacle and laid its sockets , and set up its boards , and inserted its bars and erected its pillars .
2:40:019:0	He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:020:0	Then he took the testimony and put it into the ark , and attached the poles to the ark , and put the mercy seat on top of the ark .
2:40:021:0	He brought the ark into the tabernacle , and set up a veil for the screen , and screened off the ark of the testimony , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:022:0	Then he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle , outside the veil .
2:40:023:0	He set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:024:0	Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting , opposite the table , on the south side of the tabernacle .
2:40:025:0	He lighted the lamps before the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:026:0	Then he placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil ;
2:40:027:0	and he burned fragrant incense on it , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:028:0	Then he set up the veil for the doorway of the tabernacle .
2:40:029:0	He set the altar of burnt offering before the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting , and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:030:0	He placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing .
2:40:031:0	From it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet .
2:40:032:0	When they entered the tent of meeting , and when they approached the altar , they washed , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:002:1	The Glory of the L
2:40:003:1	ord
2:40:033:0	He erected the court all around the tabernacle and the altar , and hung up the veil for the gateway of the court . Thus Moses finished the work .
2:40:034:0	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
2:40:035:0	Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
2:40:036:0	Throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the sons of Israel would set out ;
2:40:037:0	but if the cloud was not taken up , then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up .
2:40:038:0	For throughout all their journeys , the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day , and there was fire in it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel .
