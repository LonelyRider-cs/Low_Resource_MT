2:28:001:0	“ Then bring near to yourself Aaron your brother , and his sons with him , from among the sons of Israel , to minister as priest to Me—Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron’s sons .
2:28:002:0	You shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother , for glory and for beauty .
2:28:003:0	You shall speak to all the skillful persons whom I have endowed with the spirit of wisdom , that they make Aaron’s garments to consecrate him , that he may minister as priest to Me .
2:28:004:0	These are the garments which they shall make : a breastpiece and an ephod and a robe and a tunic of checkered work , a turban and a sash , and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons , that he may minister as priest to Me .
2:28:005:0	They shall take the gold and the blue and the purple and the scarlet material and the fine linen .
2:28:006:0	“ They shall also make the ephod of gold , of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen , the work of the skillful workman .
2:28:007:0	It shall have two shoulder pieces joined to its two ends , that it may be joined .
2:28:008:0	The skillfully woven band , which is on it , shall be like its workmanship , of the same material : of gold , of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen .
2:28:009:0	You shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel ,
2:28:010:0	six of their names on the one stone and the names of the remaining six on the other stone , according to their birth .
2:28:011:0	As a jeweler engraves a signet , you shall engrave the two stones according to the names of the sons of Israel ; you shall set them in filigree settings of gold .
2:28:012:0	You shall put the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod , as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel , and Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord on his two shoulders for a memorial .
2:28:013:0	You shall make filigree settings of gold ,
2:28:014:0	and two chains of pure gold ; you shall make them of twisted cordage work , and you shall put the corded chains on the filigree settings .
2:28:015:0	“ You shall make a breastpiece of judgment , the work of a skillful workman ; like the work of the ephod you shall make it : of gold , of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen you shall make it .
2:28:016:0	It shall be square and folded double , a span in length and a span in width .
2:28:017:0	You shall mount on it four rows of stones ; the first row shall be a row of ruby , topaz and emerald ;
2:28:018:0	and the second row a turquoise , a sapphire and a diamond ;
2:28:019:0	and the third row a jacinth , an agate and an amethyst ;
2:28:020:0	and the fourth row a beryl and an onyx and a jasper ; they shall be set in gold filigree .
2:28:021:0	The stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel : twelve , according to their names ; they shall be like the engravings of a seal , each according to his name for the twelve tribes .
2:28:022:0	You shall make on the breastpiece chains of twisted cordage work in pure gold .
2:28:023:0	You shall make on the breastpiece two rings of gold , and shall put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece .
2:28:024:0	You shall put the two cords of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece .
2:28:025:0	You shall put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings , and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod , at the front of it .
2:28:026:0	You shall make two rings of gold and shall place them on the two ends of the breastpiece , on the edge of it , which is toward the inner side of the ephod .
2:28:027:0	You shall make two rings of gold and put them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod , on the front of it close to the place where it is joined , above the skillfully woven band of the ephod .
2:28:028:0	They shall bind the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord , so that it will be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod , and that the breastpiece will not come loose from the ephod .
2:28:029:0	Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of judgment over his heart when he enters the holy place , for a memorial before the Lord continually .
2:28:030:0	You shall put in the breastpiece of judgment the Urim and the Thummim , and they shall be over Aaron’s heart when he goes in before the Lord ; and Aaron shall carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the Lord continually .
2:28:031:0	“ You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue .
2:28:032:0	There shall be an opening at its top in the middle of it ; around its opening there shall be a binding of woven work , like the opening of a coat of mail , so that it will not be torn .
2:28:033:0	You shall make on its hem pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material , all around on its hem , and bells of gold between them all around :
2:28:034:0	a golden bell and a pomegranate , a golden bell and a pomegranate , all around on the hem of the robe .
2:28:035:0	It shall be on Aaron when he ministers ; and its tinkling shall be heard when he enters and leaves the holy place before the Lord , so that he will not die .
2:28:036:0	“ You shall also make a plate of pure gold and shall engrave on it , like the engravings of a seal , ‘Holy to the Lord . ’
2:28:037:0	You shall fasten it on a blue cord , and it shall be on the turban ; it shall be at the front of the turban .
2:28:038:0	It shall be on Aaron’s forehead , and Aaron shall take away the iniquity of the holy things which the sons of Israel consecrate , with regard to all their holy gifts ; and it shall always be on his forehead , that they may be accepted before the Lord .
2:28:039:0	“ You shall weave the tunic of checkered work of fine linen , and shall make a turban of fine linen , and you shall make a sash , the work of a weaver .
2:28:040:0	“ For Aaron’s sons you shall make tunics ; you shall also make sashes for them , and you shall make caps for them , for glory and for beauty .
2:28:041:0	You shall put them on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him ; and you shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them , that they may serve Me as priests .
2:28:042:0	You shall make for them linen breeches to cover their bare flesh ; they shall reach from the loins even to the thighs .
2:28:043:0	They shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they enter the tent of meeting , or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place , so that they do not incur guilt and die . It shall be a statute forever to him and to his descendants after him .
