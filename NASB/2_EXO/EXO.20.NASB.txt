2:20:001:1	The Ten Commandments
2:20:001:0	Then God spoke all these words , saying ,
2:20:002:0	“ I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery .
2:20:003:0	“ You shall have no other gods before Me .
2:20:004:0	“ You shall not make for yourself an idol , or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth .
2:20:005:0	You shall not worship them or serve them ; for I , the Lord your God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children , on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me ,
2:20:006:0	but showing lovingkindness to thousands , to those who love Me and keep My commandments .
2:20:007:0	“ You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain , for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain .
2:20:008:0	“ Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
2:20:009:0	Six days you shall labor and do all your work ,
2:20:010:0	but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God ; in it you shall not do any work , you or your son or your daughter , your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you .
2:20:011:0	For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth , the sea and all that is in them , and rested on the seventh day ; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy .
2:20:012:0	“ Honor your father and your mother , that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you .
2:20:013:0	“ You shall not murder .
2:20:014:0	“ You shall not commit adultery .
2:20:015:0	“ You shall not steal .
2:20:016:0	“ You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor .
2:20:017:0	“ You shall not covet your neighbor’s house ; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor . ”
2:20:018:0	All the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking ; and when the people saw it , they trembled and stood at a distance .
2:20:019:0	Then they said to Moses , “ Speak to us yourself and we will listen ; but let not God speak to us , or we will die . ”
2:20:020:0	Moses said to the people , “ Do not be afraid ; for God has come in order to test you , and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you , so that you may not sin . ”
2:20:021:0	So the people stood at a distance , while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was .
2:20:022:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel , ‘You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven .
2:20:023:0	You shall not make other gods besides Me ; gods of silver or gods of gold , you shall not make for yourselves .
2:20:024:0	You shall make an altar of earth for Me , and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings , your sheep and your oxen ; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered , I will come to you and bless you .
2:20:025:0	If you make an altar of stone for Me , you shall not build it of cut stones , for if you wield your tool on it , you will profane it .
2:20:026:0	And you shall not go up by steps to My altar , so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it . ’
