64:1:001:1	You Walk in the Truth
64:1:001:0	The elder to the beloved Gaius , whom I love in truth .
64:1:002:0	Beloved , I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health , just as your soul prospers .
64:1:003:0	For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth , that is , how you are walking in truth .
64:1:004:0	I have no greater joy than this , to hear of my children walking in the truth .
64:1:005:0	Beloved , you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren , and especially when they are strangers ;
64:1:006:0	and they have testified to your love before the church . You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God .
64:1:007:0	For they went out for the sake of the Name , accepting nothing from the Gentiles .
64:1:008:0	Therefore we ought to support such men , so that we may be fellow workers with the truth .
64:1:009:0	I wrote something to the church ; but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , does not accept what we say .
64:1:010:0	For this reason , if I come , I will call attention to his deeds which he does , unjustly accusing us with wicked words ; and not satisfied with this , he himself does not receive the brethren , either , and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church .
64:1:011:0	Beloved , do not imitate what is evil , but what is good . The one who does good is of God ; the one who does evil has not seen God .
64:1:012:0	Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone , and from the truth itself ; and we add our testimony , and you know that our testimony is true .
64:1:013:0	I had many things to write to you , but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink ;
64:1:014:0	but I hope to see you shortly , and we will speak face to face .
64:1:015:0	Peace be to you . The friends greet you . Greet the friends by name .
