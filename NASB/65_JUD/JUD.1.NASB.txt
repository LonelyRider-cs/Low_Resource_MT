65:1:001:1	The Warnings of History to the Ungodly
65:1:001:0	Jude , a bond-servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , To those who are the called , beloved in God the Father , and kept for Jesus Christ :
65:1:002:0	May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you .
65:1:003:0	Beloved , while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation , I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints .
65:1:004:0	For certain persons have crept in unnoticed , those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation , ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65:1:005:0	Now I desire to remind you , though you know all things once for all , that the Lord , after saving a people out of the land of Egypt , subsequently destroyed those who did not believe .
65:1:006:0	And angels who did not keep their own domain , but abandoned their proper abode , He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day ,
65:1:007:0	just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them , since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh , are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire .
65:1:008:0	Yet in the same way these men , also by dreaming , defile the flesh , and reject authority , and revile angelic majesties .
65:1:009:0	But Michael the archangel , when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses , did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment , but said , “ The Lord rebuke you ! ”
65:1:010:0	But these men revile the things which they do not understand ; and the things which they know by instinct , like unreasoning animals , by these things they are destroyed .
65:1:011:0	Woe to them ! For they have gone the way of Cain , and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam , and perished in the rebellion of Korah .
65:1:012:0	These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear , caring for themselves ; clouds without water , carried along by winds ; autumn trees without fruit , doubly dead , uprooted ;
65:1:013:0	wild waves of the sea , casting up their own shame like foam ; wandering stars , for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever .
65:1:014:0	It was also about these men that Enoch , in the seventh generation from Adam , prophesied , saying , “ Behold , the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones ,
65:1:015:0	to execute judgment upon all , and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way , and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him . ”
65:1:002:1	Keep Yourselves in the Love of God
65:1:016:0	These are grumblers , finding fault , following after their own lusts ; they speak arrogantly , flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage .
65:1:017:0	But you , beloved , ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
65:1:018:0	that they were saying to you , “ In the last time there will be mockers , following after their own ungodly lusts . ”
65:1:019:0	These are the ones who cause divisions , worldly-minded , devoid of the Spirit .
65:1:020:0	But you , beloved , building yourselves up on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65:1:021:0	keep yourselves in the love of God , waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life .
65:1:022:0	And have mercy on some , who are doubting ;
65:1:023:0	save others , snatching them out of the fire ; and on some have mercy with fear , hating even the garment polluted by the flesh .
65:1:024:0	Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling , and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy ,
65:1:025:0	to the only God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory , majesty , dominion and authority , before all time and now and forever . Amen .
