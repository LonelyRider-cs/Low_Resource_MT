66:13:001:1	The Beast from the Sea
66:13:001:0	And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore . Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads , and on his horns were ten diadems , and on his heads were blasphemous names .
66:13:002:0	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority .
66:13:003:0	I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain , and his fatal wound was healed . And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast ;
66:13:004:0	they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast ; and they worshiped the beast , saying , “ Who is like the beast , and who is able to wage war with him ? ”
66:13:005:0	There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies , and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him .
66:13:006:0	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God , to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle , that is , those who dwell in heaven .
66:13:007:0	It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them , and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him .
66:13:008:0	All who dwell on the earth will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain .
66:13:009:0	If anyone has an ear , let him hear .
66:13:002:1	The Beast from the Earth
66:13:010:0	If anyone is destined for captivity , to captivity he goes ; if anyone kills with the sword , with the sword he must be killed . Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints .
66:13:011:0	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon .
66:13:012:0	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
66:13:013:0	He performs great signs , so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men .
66:13:014:0	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast , telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life .
66:13:015:0	And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast , so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
66:13:016:0	And he causes all , the small and the great , and the rich and the poor , and the free men and the slaves , to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead ,
66:13:017:0	and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell , except the one who has the mark , either the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66:13:018:0	Here is wisdom . Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for the number is that of a man ; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six .
