66:2:001:1	Message to Ephesus
66:2:001:0	“ To the angel of the church in Ephesus write : he One who holds the seven stars in His right hand , the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands , says this :
66:2:002:0	‘I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance , and that you cannot tolerate evil men , and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles , and they are not , and you found them false ;
66:2:003:0	and you have perseverance and have endured for My name’s sake , and have not grown weary .
66:2:004:0	But I have against you , that you have left your first love .
66:2:005:0	Therefore remember from where you have fallen , and repent and do the deeds you did at first ; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place—unless you repent .
66:2:006:0	Yet this you do have , that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66:2:002:1	Message to Smyrna
66:2:007:0	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who overcomes , I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God . ’
66:2:008:0	“ And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write : he first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life , says this :
66:2:009:0	‘I know your tribulation and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66:2:010:0	Do not fear what you are about to suffer . Behold , the devil is about to cast some of you into prison , so that you will be tested , and you will have tribulation for ten days . Be faithful until death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66:2:003:1	Message to Pergamum
66:2:011:0	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death . ’
66:2:012:0	“ And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write : he One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this :
66:2:013:0	‘I know where you dwell , where Satan’s throne is ; and you hold fast My name , and did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas , My witness , My faithful one , who was killed among you , where Satan dwells .
66:2:014:0	But I have a few things against you , because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam , who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel , to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit immorality .
66:2:015:0	So you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66:2:016:0	Therefore repent ; or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth .
66:2:004:1	Message to Thyatira
66:2:017:0	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who overcomes , to him I will give of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone , and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it . ’
66:2:018:0	“ And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write : he Son of God , who has eyes like a flame of fire , and His feet are like burnished bronze , says this :
66:2:019:0	‘I know your deeds , and your love and faith and service and perseverance , and that your deeds of late are greater than at first .
66:2:020:0	But I have against you , that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols .
66:2:021:0	I gave her time to repent , and she does not want to repent of her immorality .
66:2:022:0	Behold , I will throw her on a bed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation , unless they repent of her deeds .
66:2:023:0	And I will kill her children with pestilence , and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts ; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds .
66:2:024:0	But I say to you , the rest who are in Thyatira , who do not hold this teaching , who have not known the deep things of Satan , as they call them—I place no other burden on you .
66:2:025:0	Nevertheless what you have , hold fast until I come .
66:2:026:0	He who overcomes , and he who keeps My deeds until the end , I ;
66:2:027:0	, , as I also have received from My Father ;
66:2:028:0	and I will give him the morning star .
66:2:029:0	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
