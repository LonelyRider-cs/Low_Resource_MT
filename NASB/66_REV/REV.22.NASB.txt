66:22:001:1	The River and the Tree of Life
66:22:001:0	Then he showed me a river of the water of life , clear as crystal , coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
66:22:002:0	in the middle of its street . On either side of the river was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruit , yielding its fruit every month ; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
66:22:003:0	There will no longer be any curse ; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it , and His bond-servants will serve Him ;
66:22:004:0	they will see His face , and His name will be on their foreheads .
66:22:005:0	And there will no longer be any night ; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun , because the Lord God will illumine them ; and they will reign forever and ever .
66:22:006:0	And he said to me , “ These words are faithful and true ” ; and the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place .
66:22:007:0	“ And behold , I am coming quickly . Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book . ”
66:22:008:0	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . And when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things .
66:22:002:1	The Final Message
66:22:009:0	But he *said to me , “ Do not do that . I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book . Worship God . ”
66:22:010:0	And he *said to me , “ Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is near .
66:22:011:0	Let the one who does wrong , still do wrong ; and the one who is filthy , still be filthy ; and let the one who is righteous , still practice righteousness ; and the one who is holy , still keep himself holy . ”
66:22:012:0	“ Behold , I am coming quickly , and My reward with Me , to render to every man according to what he has done .
66:22:013:0	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end . ”
66:22:014:0	Blessed are those who wash their robes , so that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter by the gates into the city .
66:22:015:0	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices lying .
66:22:016:0	“ I , Jesus , have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches . I am the root and the descendant of David , the bright morning star . ”
66:22:017:0	The Spirit and the bride say , “ Come . ” And let the one who hears say , “ Come . ” And let the one who is thirsty come ; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost .
66:22:018:0	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book : if anyone adds to them , God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book ;
66:22:019:0	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city , which are written in this book .
66:22:020:0	He who testifies to these things says , “ Yes , I am coming quickly . ” Amen . Come , Lord Jesus .
66:22:021:0	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all . Amen .
