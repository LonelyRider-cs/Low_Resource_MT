66:8:001:1	The Seventh Seal—the Trumpets
66:8:001:0	When the Lamb broke the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66:8:002:0	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66:8:003:0	Another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden censer ; and much incense was given to him , so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne .
66:8:004:0	And the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel’s hand .
66:8:005:0	Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it to the earth ; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake .
66:8:006:0	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them .
66:8:007:0	The first sounded , and there came hail and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the earth ; and a third of the earth was burned up , and a third of the trees were burned up , and all the green grass was burned up .
66:8:008:0	The second angel sounded , and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea ; and a third of the sea became blood ,
66:8:009:0	and a third of the creatures which were in the sea and had life , died ; and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66:8:010:0	The third angel sounded , and a great star fell from heaven , burning like a torch , and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters .
66:8:011:0	The name of the star is called Wormwood ; and a third of the waters became wormwood , and many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
66:8:012:0	The fourth angel sounded , and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck , so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it , and the night in the same way .
66:8:013:0	Then I looked , and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven , saying with a loud voice , “ Woe , woe , woe to those who dwell on the earth , because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound ! ”
