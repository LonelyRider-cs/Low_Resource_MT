66:18:001:1	Babylon Is Fallen
66:18:001:0	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven , having great authority , and the earth was illumined with his glory .
66:18:002:0	And he cried out with a mighty voice , saying , “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit , and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird .
66:18:003:0	For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality , and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality . ”
66:18:004:0	I heard another voice from heaven , saying , “ Come out of her , my people , so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues ;
66:18:005:0	for her sins have piled up as high as heaven , and God has remembered her iniquities .
66:18:006:0	Pay her back even as she has paid , and give back to her double according to her deeds ; in the cup which she has mixed , mix twice as much for her .
66:18:007:0	To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously , to the same degree give her torment and mourning ; for she says in her heart , ‘I sit as a queen and I am not a widow , and will never see mourning . ’
66:18:002:1	Lament for Babylon
66:18:008:0	For this reason in one day her plagues will come , pestilence and mourning and famine , and she will be burned up with fire ; for the Lord God who judges her is strong .
66:18:009:0	“ And the kings of the earth , who committed acts of immorality and lived sensuously with her , will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning ,
66:18:010:0	standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment , saying , ‘Woe , woe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! For in one hour your judgment has come . ’
66:18:011:0	“ And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , because no one buys their cargoes any more—
66:18:012:0	cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet , and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble ,
66:18:013:0	and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep , and cargoes of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives .
66:18:014:0	The fruit you long for has gone from you , and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and men will no longer find them .
66:18:015:0	The merchants of these things , who became rich from her , will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ,
66:18:016:0	saying , ‘Woe , woe , the great city , she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls ;
66:18:017:0	for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste ! ’ And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor , and as many as make their living by the sea , stood at a distance ,
66:18:018:0	and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , ‘What city is like the great city ? ’
66:18:019:0	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out , weeping and mourning , saying , ‘Woe , woe , the great city , in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth , for in one hour she has been laid waste ! ’
66:18:020:0	Rejoice over her , O heaven , and you saints and apostles and prophets , because God has pronounced judgment for you against her . ”
66:18:021:0	Then a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , “ So will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down with violence , and will not be found any longer .
66:18:022:0	And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer ; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer ; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer ;
66:18:023:0	and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer ; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer ; for your merchants were the great men of the earth , because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery .
66:18:024:0	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth . ”
