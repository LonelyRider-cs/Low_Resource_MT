66:20:001:1	Satan Bound
66:20:001:0	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand .
66:20:002:0	And he laid hold of the dragon , the serpent of old , who is the devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ;
66:20:003:0	and he threw him into the abyss , and shut it and sealed it over him , so that he would not deceive the nations any longer , until the thousand years were completed ; after these things he must be released for a short time .
66:20:004:0	Then I saw thrones , and they sat on them , and judgment was given to them . And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God , and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand ; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years .
66:20:005:0	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed . This is the first resurrection .
66:20:002:1	Satan Freed , Doomed
66:20:006:0	Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection ; over these the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years .
66:20:007:0	When the thousand years are completed , Satan will be released from his prison ,
66:20:008:0	and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together for the war ; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore .
66:20:009:0	And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city , and fire came down from heaven and devoured them .
66:20:003:1	Judgment at the Throne of God
66:20:010:0	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are also ; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
66:20:011:0	Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it , from whose presence earth and heaven fled away , and no place was found for them .
66:20:012:0	And I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne , and books were opened ; and another book was opened , which is the book of life ; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books , according to their deeds .
66:20:013:0	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it , and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them ; and they were judged , every one of them according to their deeds .
66:20:014:0	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death , the lake of fire .
66:20:015:0	And if anyoneâ€™s name was not found written in the book of life , he was thrown into the lake of fire .
