66:12:001:1	The Woman , Israel
66:12:001:0	A great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars ;
66:12:002:1	The Red Dragon , Satan
66:12:002:0	and she was with child ; and she *cried out , being in labor and in pain to give birth .
66:12:003:0	Then another sign appeared in heaven : and behold , a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads were seven diadems .
66:12:003:1	The Male Child , Christ
66:12:004:0	And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might devour her child .
66:12:005:0	And she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron ; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne .
66:12:004:1	The Angel , Michael
66:12:006:0	Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God , so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days .
66:12:007:0	And there was war in heaven , Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon . The dragon and his angels waged war ,
66:12:008:0	and they were not strong enough , and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven .
66:12:009:0	And the great dragon was thrown down , the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan , who deceives the whole world ; he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
66:12:010:0	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven , saying , “ Now the salvation , and the power , and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come , for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down , he who accuses them before our God day and night .
66:12:011:0	And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony , and they did not love their life even when faced with death .
66:12:012:0	For this reason , rejoice , O heavens and you who dwell in them . Woe to the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has only a short time . ”
66:12:013:0	And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
66:12:014:0	But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman , so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place , where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time , from the presence of the serpent .
66:12:015:0	And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman , so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood .
66:12:016:0	But the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth .
66:12:017:0	So the dragon was enraged with the woman , and went off to make war with the rest of her children , who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus .
