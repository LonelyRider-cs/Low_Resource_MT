66:3:002:0	Wake up , and strengthen the things that remain , which were about to die ; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God .
66:3:003:0	So remember what you have received and heard ; and keep and repent . Therefore if you do not wake up , I will come like a thief , and you will not know at what hour I will come to you .
66:3:004:0	But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments ; and they will walk with Me in white , for they are worthy .
66:3:005:0	He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments ; and I will not erase his name from the book of life , and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels .

66:3:009:0	Behold , I will cause of the synagogue of Satan , who say that they are Jews and are not , but lie—I will make them come and bow down at your feet , and know that I have loved you .
66:3:010:0	Because you have kept the word of My perseverance , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , that which is about to come upon the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .

66:3:015:0	‘I know your deeds , that you are neither cold nor hot ; I wish that you were cold or hot .
66:3:016:0	So because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I will spit you out of My mouth .
66:3:017:0	Because you say , “ I am rich , and have become wealthy , and have need of nothing , ” and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked ,
66:3:018:0	I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich , and white garments so that you may clothe yourself , and the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed ; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see .
66:3:019:0	Those whom I love , I reprove and discipline ; therefore be zealous and repent .
66:3:020:0	Behold , I stand at the door and knock ; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door , I will come in to him and will dine with him , and he with Me .
66:3:021:0	He who overcomes , I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne , as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne .
66:3:022:0	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’ ”
