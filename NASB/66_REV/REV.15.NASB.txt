66:15:001:1	A Scene of Heaven
66:15:001:0	Then I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvelous , seven angels who had seven plagues , which are the last , because in them the wrath of God is finished .
66:15:002:0	And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire , and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name , standing on the sea of glass , holding harps of God .
66:15:003:0	And they *sang the song of Moses , the bond-servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , “ Great and marvelous are Your works , O Lord God , the Almighty ; Righteous and true are Your ways , King of the nations !
66:15:004:0	Who will not fear , O Lord , and glorify Your name ? For You alone are holy ; For all the nations will come and worship before You , For Your righteous acts have been revealed . ”
66:15:005:0	After these things I looked , and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened ,
66:15:006:0	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple , clothed in linen , clean and bright , and girded around their chests with golden sashes .
66:15:007:0	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
66:15:008:0	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power ; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished .
