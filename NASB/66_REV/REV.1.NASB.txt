66:1:001:1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ
66:1:001:0	The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants , the things which must soon take place ; and He sent and communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John ,
66:1:002:0	who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ , even to all that he saw .
66:1:002:1	Message to the Seven Churches
66:1:003:0	Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy , and heed the things which are written in it ; for the time is near .
66:1:004:0	John to the seven churches that are in Asia : Grace to you and peace , from Him who is and who was and who is to come , and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne ,
66:1:005:0	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood—
66:1:006:0	and He has made us to be a kingdom , priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
66:1:007:0	Behold , He is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see Him , even those who pierced Him ; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him . So it is to be . Amen .
66:1:003:1	The Patmos Vision
66:1:008:0	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , ” says the Lord God , “ who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . ”
66:1:009:0	I , John , your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus , was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus .
66:1:010:0	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day , and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet ,
66:1:011:0	saying , “ Write in a book what you see , and send to the seven churches : to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea . ”
66:1:012:0	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me . And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands ;
66:1:013:0	and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man , clothed in a robe reaching to the feet , and girded across His chest with a golden sash .
66:1:014:0	His head and His hair were white like white wool , like snow ; and His eyes were like a flame of fire .
66:1:015:0	His feet were like burnished bronze , when it has been made to glow in a furnace , and His voice was like the sound of many waters .
66:1:016:0	In His right hand He held seven stars , and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword ; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength .
66:1:017:0	When I saw Him , I fell at His feet like a dead man . And He placed His right hand on me , saying , “ Do not be afraid ; I am the first and the last ,
66:1:018:0	and the living One ; and I was dead , and behold , I am alive forevermore , and I have the keys of death and of Hades .
66:1:019:0	Therefore write the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will take place after these things .
66:1:020:0	As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand , and the seven golden lampstands : the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
