66:11:001:1	The Two Witnesses
66:11:001:0	Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff ; and someone said , “ Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar , and those who worship in it .
66:11:002:0	Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it , for it has been given to the nations ; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months .
66:11:003:0	And I will grant authority to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . ”
66:11:004:0	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
66:11:005:0	And if anyone wants to harm them , fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies ; so if anyone wants to harm them , he must be killed in this way .
66:11:006:0	These have the power to shut up the sky , so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying ; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
66:11:007:0	When they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them and kill them .
66:11:008:0	And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
66:11:009:0	Those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
66:11:010:0	And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate ; and they will send gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
66:11:011:0	But after the three and a half days , the breath of life from God came into them , and they stood on their feet ; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them .
66:11:012:0	And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , “ Come up here . ” Then they went up into heaven in the cloud , and their enemies watched them .
66:11:013:0	And in that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell ; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66:11:002:1	The Seventh Trumpet—Christ’s Reign Foreseen
66:11:014:0	The second woe is past ; behold , the third woe is coming quickly .
66:11:015:0	Then the seventh angel sounded ; and there were loud voices in heaven , saying , “ The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ ; and He will reign forever and ever . ”
66:11:016:0	And the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before God , fell on their faces and worshiped God ,
66:11:017:0	saying , “ We give You thanks , O Lord God , the Almighty , who are and who were , because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign .
66:11:018:0	And the nations were enraged , and Your wrath came , and the time came for the dead to be judged , and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name , the small and the great , and to destroy those who destroy the earth . ”
66:11:019:0	And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened ; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple , and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm .
