66:4:001:1	Scene in Heaven
66:4:001:0	After these things I looked , and behold , a door standing open in heaven , and the first voice which I had heard , like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me , said , “ Come up here , and I will show you what must take place after these things . ”
66:4:002:0	Immediately I was in the Spirit ; and behold , a throne was standing in heaven , and One sitting on the throne .
66:4:003:0	And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance ; and there was a rainbow around the throne , like an emerald in appearance .
66:4:002:1	The Throne and Worship of the Creator
66:4:004:0	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones ; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting , clothed in white garments , and golden crowns on their heads .
66:4:005:0	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder . And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God ;
66:4:006:0	and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass , like crystal ; and in the center and around the throne , four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind .
66:4:007:0	The first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a calf , and the third creature had a face like that of a man , and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle .
66:4:008:0	And the four living creatures , each one of them having six wings , are full of eyes around and within ; and day and night they do not cease to say , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God , the Almighty , who was and who is and who is to come . ”
66:4:009:0	And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne , to Him who lives forever and ever ,
66:4:010:0	the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne , and will worship Him who lives forever and ever , and will cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
66:4:011:0	“ Worthy are You , our Lord and our God , to receive glory and honor and power ; for You created all things , and because of Your will they existed , and were created . ”
