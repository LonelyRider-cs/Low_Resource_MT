66:16:001:1	Six Bowls of Wrath
66:16:001:0	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple , saying to the seven angels , “ Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God . ”
66:16:002:0	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth ; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image .
66:16:003:0	The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood like that of a dead man ; and every living thing in the sea died .
66:16:004:0	Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters ; and they became blood .
66:16:005:0	And I heard the angel of the waters saying , “ Righteous are You , who are and who were , O Holy One , because You judged these things ;
66:16:006:0	for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets , and You have given them blood to drink . They deserve it . ”
66:16:007:0	And I heard the altar saying , “ Yes , O Lord God , the Almighty , true and righteous are Your judgments . ”
66:16:008:0	The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun , and it was given to it to scorch men with fire .
66:16:009:0	Men were scorched with fierce heat ; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues , and they did not repent so as to give Him glory .
66:16:010:0	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom became darkened ; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain ,
66:16:011:0	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores ; and they did not repent of their deeds .
66:16:002:1	Armageddon
66:16:012:0	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates ; and its water was dried up , so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east .
66:16:013:0	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits like frogs ;
66:16:014:0	for they are spirits of demons , performing signs , which go out to the kings of the whole world , to gather them together for the war of the great day of God , the Almighty .
66:16:015:0	( “ Behold , I am coming like a thief . Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes , so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame . ” )
66:16:003:1	Seventh Bowl of Wrath
66:16:016:0	And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon .
66:16:017:0	Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air , and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne , saying , “ It is done . ”
66:16:018:0	And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder ; and there was a great earthquake , such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth , so great an earthquake was it , and so mighty .
66:16:019:0	The great city was split into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Babylon the great was remembered before God , to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath .
66:16:020:0	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
66:16:021:0	And huge hailstones , about one hundred pounds each , *came down from heaven upon men ; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail , because its plague *was extremely severe .
