66:5:001:1	The Book with Seven Seals
66:5:001:0	I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back , sealed up with seven seals .
66:5:002:0	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals ? ”
66:5:003:0	And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it .
66:5:004:0	Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it ;
66:5:005:0	and one of the elders *said to me , “ Stop weeping ; behold , the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals . ”
66:5:006:0	And I saw between the throne ( with the four living creatures ) and the elders a Lamb standing , as if slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
66:5:007:0	And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne .
66:5:008:0	When He had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
66:5:009:0	And they *sang a new song , saying , “ Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals ; for You were slain , and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation .
66:5:002:1	Angels Exalt the Lamb
66:5:010:0	You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God ; and they will reign upon the earth . ”
66:5:011:0	Then I looked , and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders ; and the number of them was myriads of myriads , and thousands of thousands ,
66:5:012:0	saying with a loud voice , “ Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing . ”
66:5:013:0	And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea , and all things in them , I heard saying , “ To Him who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb , be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever . ”
66:5:014:0	And the four living creatures kept saying , “ Amen . ” And the elders fell down and worshiped .
