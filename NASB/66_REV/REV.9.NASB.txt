66:9:001:1	The Fifth Trumpet—the Bottomless Pit
66:9:001:0	Then the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth ; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him .
66:9:002:0	He opened the bottomless pit , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit .
66:9:003:0	Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth , and power was given them , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
66:9:004:0	They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth , nor any green thing , nor any tree , but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
66:9:005:0	And they were not permitted to kill anyone , but to torment for five months ; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man .
66:9:006:0	And in those days men will seek death and will not find it ; they will long to die , and death flees from them .
66:9:007:0	The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle ; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold , and their faces were like the faces of men .
66:9:008:0	They had hair like the hair of women , and their teeth were like the teeth of lions .
66:9:009:0	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots , of many horses rushing to battle .
66:9:010:0	They have tails like scorpions , and stings ; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months .
66:9:011:0	They have as king over them , the angel of the abyss ; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon .
66:9:002:1	The Sixth Trumpet—Army from the East
66:9:012:0	The first woe is past ; behold , two woes are still coming after these things .
66:9:013:0	Then the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
66:9:014:0	one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates . ”
66:9:015:0	And the four angels , who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year , were released , so that they would kill a third of mankind .
66:9:016:0	The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million ; I heard the number of them .
66:9:017:0	And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them : the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone ; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone .
66:9:018:0	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues , by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths .
66:9:019:0	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails are like serpents and have heads , and with them they do harm .
66:9:020:0	The rest of mankind , who were not killed by these plagues , did not repent of the works of their hands , so as not to worship demons , and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk ;
66:9:021:0	and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts .
