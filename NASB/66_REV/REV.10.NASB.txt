66:10:001:1	The Angel and the Little Book
66:10:001:0	I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven , clothed with a cloud ; and the rainbow was upon his head , and his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire ;
66:10:002:0	and he had in his hand a little book which was open . He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land ;
66:10:003:0	and he cried out with a loud voice , as when a lion roars ; and when he had cried out , the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices .
66:10:004:0	When the seven peals of thunder had spoken , I was about to write ; and I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them . ”
66:10:005:0	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven ,
66:10:006:0	and swore by Him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things in it , and the earth and the things in it , and the sea and the things in it , that there will be delay no longer ,
66:10:007:0	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as He preached to His servants the prophets .
66:10:008:0	Then the voice which I heard from heaven , I heard again speaking with me , and saying , “ Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . ”
66:10:009:0	So I went to the angel , telling him to give me the little book . And he *said to me , “ Take it and eat it ; it will make your stomach bitter , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey . ”
66:10:010:0	I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it , and in my mouth it was sweet as honey ; and when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
66:10:011:0	And they *said to me , “ You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings . ”
