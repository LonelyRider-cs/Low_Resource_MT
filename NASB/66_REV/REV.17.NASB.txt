66:17:001:1	The Doom of Babylon
66:17:001:0	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me , saying , “ Come here , I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters ,
66:17:002:0	with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality , and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality . ”
66:17:003:0	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness ; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast , full of blasphemous names , having seven heads and ten horns .
66:17:004:0	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality ,
66:17:005:0	and on her forehead a name was written , a mystery , “ BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH . ”
66:17:006:0	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus . When I saw her , I wondered greatly .
66:17:007:0	And the angel said to me , “ Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
66:17:008:0	“ The beast that you saw was , and is not , and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction . And those who dwell on the earth , whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , will wonder when they see the beast , that he was and is not and will come .
66:17:009:0	Here is the mind which has wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits ,
66:17:010:0	and they are seven kings ; five have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come ; and when he comes , he must remain a little while .
66:17:011:0	The beast which was and is not , is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven , and he goes to destruction .
66:17:012:0	The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom , but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour .
66:17:002:1	Victory for the Lamb
66:17:013:0	These have one purpose , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66:17:014:0	These will wage war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome them , because He is Lord of lords and King of kings , and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful . ”
66:17:015:0	And he *said to me , “ The waters which you saw where the harlot sits , are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues .
66:17:016:0	And the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked , and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire .
66:17:017:0	For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose , and by giving their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God will be fulfilled .
66:17:018:0	The woman whom you saw is the great city , which reigns over the kings of the earth . ”
