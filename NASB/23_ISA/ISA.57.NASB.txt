23:57:001:1	Evil Leaders Rebuked
23:57:001:0	The righteous man perishes , and no man takes it to heart ; And devout men are taken away , while no one understands . For the righteous man is taken away from evil ,
23:57:002:0	He enters into peace ; They rest in their beds , Each one who walked in his upright way .
23:57:003:0	“ But come here , you sons of a sorceress , Offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute .
23:57:004:0	Against whom do you jest ? Against whom do you open wide your mouthAnd stick out your tongue ? Are you not children of rebellion , Offspring of deceit ,
23:57:005:0	Who inflame yourselves among the oaks , Under every luxuriant tree , Who slaughter the children in the ravines , Under the clefts of the crags ?
23:57:006:0	Among the smooth stones of the ravineIs your portion , they are your lot ; Even to them you have poured out a drink offering , You have made a grain offering . Shall I relent concerning these things ?
23:57:007:0	Upon a high and lofty mountainYou have made your bed . You also went up there to offer sacrifice .
23:57:008:0	Behind the door and the doorpostYou have set up your sign ; Indeed , far removed from Me , you have uncovered yourself , And have gone up and made your bed wide . And you have made an agreement for yourself with them , You have loved their bed , You have looked on their manhood .
23:57:009:0	You have journeyed to the king with oilAnd increased your perfumes ; You have sent your envoys a great distanceAnd made them go down to Sheol .
23:57:010:0	You were tired out by the length of your road , Yet you did not say , ‘It is hopeless . ’You found renewed strength , Therefore you did not faint .
23:57:011:0	“ Of whom were you worried and fearfulWhen you lied , and did not remember MeNor give Me a thought ? Was I not silent even for a long timeSo you do not fear Me ?
23:57:012:0	I will declare your righteousness and your deeds , But they will not profit you .
23:57:013:0	When you cry out , let your collection of idols deliver you . But the wind will carry all of them up , And a breath will take them away . But he who takes refuge in Me will inherit the landAnd will possess My holy mountain . ”
23:57:014:0	And it will be said , “ Build up , build up , prepare the way , Remove every obstacle out of the way of My people . ”
23:57:015:0	For thus says the high and exalted OneWho lives forever , whose name is Holy , “ I dwell on a high and holy place , And also with the contrite and lowly of spiritIn order to revive the spirit of the lowlyAnd to revive the heart of the contrite .
23:57:016:0	For I will not contend forever , Nor will I always be angry ; For the spirit would grow faint before Me , And the breath of those whom I have made .
23:57:017:0	Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him ; I hid My face and was angry , And he went on turning away , in the way of his heart .
23:57:018:0	I have seen his ways , but I will heal him ; I will lead him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners ,
23:57:019:0	Creating the praise of the lips . Peace , peace to him who is far and to him who is near , ” Says the Lord , “ and I will heal him . ”
23:57:020:0	But the wicked are like the tossing sea , For it cannot be quiet , And its waters toss up refuse and mud .
23:57:021:0	“ There is no peace , ” says my God , “ for the wicked . ”
