23:2:001:1	God’s Universal Reign
23:2:001:0	The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem .
23:2:002:0	Now it will come about thatIn the last daysThe mountain of the house of the LordWill be established as the chief of the mountains , And will be raised above the hills ; And all the nations will stream to it .
23:2:003:0	And many peoples will come and say , “ Come , let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , To the house of the God of Jacob ; That He may teach us concerning His waysAnd that we may walk in His paths . ” For the law will go forth from ZionAnd the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
23:2:004:0	And He will judge between the nations , And will render decisions for many peoples ; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks . Nation will not lift up sword against nation , And never again will they learn war .
23:2:005:0	Come , house of Jacob , and let us walk in the light of the Lord .
23:2:006:0	For You have abandoned Your people , the house of Jacob , Because they are filled with influences from the east , And they are soothsayers like the Philistines , And they strike bargains with the children of foreigners .
23:2:007:0	Their land has also been filled with silver and goldAnd there is no end to their treasures ; Their land has also been filled with horsesAnd there is no end to their chariots .
23:2:008:0	Their land has also been filled with idols ; They worship the work of their hands , That which their fingers have made .
23:2:009:0	So the common man has been humbledAnd the man of importance has been abased , But do not forgive them .
23:2:010:0	Enter the rock and hide in the dustFrom the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of His majesty .
23:2:002:1	A Day of Reckoning Coming
23:2:011:0	The proud look of man will be abasedAnd the loftiness of man will be humbled , And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day .
23:2:012:0	For the Lord of hosts will have a day of reckoningAgainst everyone who is proud and loftyAnd against everyone who is lifted up , That he may be abased .
23:2:013:0	And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up , Against all the oaks of Bashan ,
23:2:014:0	Against all the lofty mountains , Against all the hills that are lifted up ,
23:2:015:0	Against every high tower , Against every fortified wall ,
23:2:016:0	Against all the ships of TarshishAnd against all the beautiful craft .
23:2:017:0	The pride of man will be humbledAnd the loftiness of men will be abased ; And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day ,
23:2:018:0	But the idols will completely vanish .
23:2:019:0	Men will go into caves of the rocksAnd into holes of the groundBefore the terror of the LordAnd the splendor of His majesty , When He arises to make the earth tremble .
23:2:020:0	In that day men will cast away to the moles and the batsTheir idols of silver and their idols of gold , Which they made for themselves to worship ,
23:2:021:0	In order to go into the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffsBefore the terror of the Lord and the splendor of His majesty , When He arises to make the earth tremble .
23:2:022:0	Stop regarding man , whose breath of life is in his nostrils ; For why should he be esteemed ?
