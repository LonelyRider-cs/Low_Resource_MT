23:61:001:1	Exaltation of the Afflicted
23:61:001:0	The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me , Because the Lord has anointed meTo bring good news to the afflicted ; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , To proclaim liberty to captivesAnd freedom to prisoners ;
23:61:002:0	To proclaim the favorable year of the LordAnd the day of vengeance of our God ; To comfort all who mourn ,
23:61:003:0	To grant those who mourn in Zion , Giving them a garland instead of ashes , The oil of gladness instead of mourning , The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting . So they will be called oaks of righteousness , The planting of the Lord , that He may be glorified .
23:61:004:0	Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins , They will raise up the former devastations ; And they will repair the ruined cities , The desolations of many generations .
23:61:005:0	Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks , And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers .
23:61:006:0	But you will be called the priests of the Lord ; You will be spoken of as ministers of our God . You will eat the wealth of nations , And in their riches you will boast .
23:61:007:0	Instead of your shame you will have a double portion , And instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion . Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land , Everlasting joy will be theirs .
23:61:008:0	For I , the Lord , love justice , I hate robbery in the burnt offering ; And I will faithfully give them their recompenseAnd make an everlasting covenant with them .
23:61:009:0	Then their offspring will be known among the nations , And their descendants in the midst of the peoples . All who see them will recognize themBecause they are the offspring whom the Lord has blessed .
23:61:010:0	I will rejoice greatly in the Lord , My soul will exult in my God ; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation , He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness , As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland , And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels .
23:61:011:0	For as the earth brings forth its sprouts , And as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up , So the Lord God will cause righteousness and praiseTo spring up before all the nations .
