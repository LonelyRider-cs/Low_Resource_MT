23:31:001:1	Help Not in Egypt but in God
23:31:001:0	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help And rely on horses , And trust in chariots because they are manyAnd in horsemen because they are very strong , But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel , nor seek the Lord !
23:31:002:0	Yet He also is wise and will bring disasterAnd does not retract His words , But will arise against the house of evildoersAnd against the help of the workers of iniquity .
23:31:003:0	Now the Egyptians are men and not God , And their horses are flesh and not spirit ; So the Lord will stretch out His hand , And he who helps will stumbleAnd he who is helped will fall , And all of them will come to an end together .
23:31:004:0	For thus says the Lord to me , “ As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey , Against which a band of shepherds is called out , And he will not be terrified at their voice nor disturbed at their noise , So will the Lord of hosts come down to wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill . ”
23:31:005:0	Like flying birds so the Lord of hosts will protect Jerusalem . He will protect and deliver it ; He will pass over and rescue it .
23:31:006:0	Return to Him from whom you have deeply defected , O sons of Israel .
23:31:007:0	For in that day every man will cast away his silver idols and his gold idols , which your sinful hands have made for you as a sin .
23:31:008:0	And the Assyrian will fall by a sword not of man , And a sword not of man will devour him . So he will not escape the sword , And his young men will become forced laborers .
23:31:009:0	“ His rock will pass away because of panic , And his princes will be terrified at the standard , ” Declares the Lord , whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem .
