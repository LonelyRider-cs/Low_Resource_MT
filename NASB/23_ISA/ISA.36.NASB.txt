23:36:001:1	Sennacherib Invades Judah
23:36:001:0	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them .
23:36:002:0	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army . And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller’s field .
23:36:003:0	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came out to him .
23:36:004:0	Then Rabshakeh said to them , “ Say now to Hezekiah , ‘Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , “ What is this confidence that you have ?
23:36:005:0	I say , ‘Your counsel and strength for the war are only empty words . ’ Now on whom do you rely , that you have rebelled against me ?
23:36:006:0	Behold , you rely on the staff of this crushed reed , even on Egypt , on which if a man leans , it will go into his hand and pierce it . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him .
23:36:007:0	But if you say to me , ‘We trust in the Lord our God , ’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem , ‘You shall worship before this altar’ ?
23:36:008:0	Now therefore , come make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
23:36:009:0	How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master’s servants and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
23:36:010:0	Have I now come up without the Lord’s approval against this land to destroy it ? The Lord said to me , ‘Go up against this land and destroy it . ’ ” ’ ”
23:36:011:0	Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh , “ Speak now to your servants in Aramaic , for we understand it ; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . ”
23:36:012:0	But Rabshakeh said , “ Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words , and not to the men who sit on the wall , doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you ? ”
23:36:013:0	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean and said , “ Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
23:36:014:0	Thus says the king , ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you , for he will not be able to deliver you ;
23:36:015:0	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us , this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . ”
23:36:016:0	Do not listen to Hezekiah , ’ for thus says the king of Assyria , ‘Make your peace with me and come out to me , and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern ,
23:36:017:0	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
23:36:018:0	Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you , saying , “ The Lord will deliver us . ” Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
23:36:019:0	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? And when have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
23:36:020:0	Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand , that the Lord would deliver Jerusalem from my hand ? ’ ”
23:36:021:0	But they were silent and answered him not a word ; for the king’s commandment was , “ Do not answer him . ”
23:36:022:0	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
