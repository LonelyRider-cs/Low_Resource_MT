23:58:001:1	Observances of Fasts
23:58:001:0	“ Cry loudly , do not hold back ; Raise your voice like a trumpet , And declare to My people their transgressionAnd to the house of Jacob their sins .
23:58:002:0	Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways , As a nation that has done righteousnessAnd has not forsaken the ordinance of their God . They ask Me for just decisions , They delight in the nearness of God .
23:58:003:0	‘Why have we fasted and You do not see ? Why have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice ? ’Behold , on the day of your fast you find your desire , And drive hard all your workers .
23:58:004:0	Behold , you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist . You do not fast like you do today to make your voice heard on high .
23:58:005:0	Is it a fast like this which I choose , a day for a man to humble himself ? Is it for bowing one’s head like a reedAnd for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed ? Will you call this a fast , even an acceptable day to the Lord ?
23:58:006:0	Is this not the fast which I choose , To loosen the bonds of wickedness , To undo the bands of the yoke , And to let the oppressed go freeAnd break every yoke ?
23:58:007:0	Is it not to divide your bread with the hungryAnd bring the homeless poor into the house ; When you see the naked , to cover him ; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh ?
23:58:008:0	Then your light will break out like the dawn , And your recovery will speedily spring forth ; And your righteousness will go before you ; The glory of the Lord will be your rear guard .
23:58:009:0	Then you will call , and the Lord will answer ; You will cry , and He will say , ‘Here I am . ’If you remove the yoke from your midst , The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness ,
23:58:010:0	And if you give yourself to the hungryAnd satisfy the desire of the afflicted , Then your light will rise in darknessAnd your gloom will become like midday .
23:58:011:0	And the Lord will continually guide you , And satisfy your desire in scorched places , And give strength to your bones ; And you will be like a watered garden , And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail .
23:58:002:1	Keeping the Sabbath
23:58:012:0	Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins ; You will raise up the age-old foundations ; And you will be called the repairer of the breach , The restorer of the streets in which to dwell .
23:58:013:0	“ If because of the sabbath , you turn your footFrom doing your own pleasure on My holy day , And call the sabbath a delight , the holy day of the Lord honorable , And honor it , desisting from your own ways , From seeking your own pleasureAnd speaking your own word ,
23:58:014:0	Then you will take delight in the Lord , And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth ; And I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father , For the mouth of the Lord has spoken . ”
