23:49:001:1	Salvation Reaches to the End of the Earth
23:49:001:0	Listen to Me , O islands , And pay attention , you peoples from afar . The Lord called Me from the womb ; From the body of My mother He named Me .
23:49:002:0	He has made My mouth like a sharp sword , In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me ; And He has also made Me a select arrow , He has hidden Me in His quiver .
23:49:003:0	He said to Me , “ You are My Servant , Israel , In Whom I will show My glory . ”
23:49:004:0	But I said , “ I have toiled in vain , I have spent My strength for nothing and vanity ; Yet surely the justice due to Me is with the Lord , And My reward with My God . ”
23:49:005:0	And now says the Lord , who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant , To bring Jacob back to Him , so that Israel might be gathered to Him ( For I am honored in the sight of the Lord , And My God is My strength ) ,
23:49:006:0	He says , “ It is too small a thing that You should be My ServantTo raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel ; I will also make You a light of the nationsSo that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth . ”
23:49:007:0	Thus says the Lord , the Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One , To the despised One , To the One abhorred by the nation , To the Servant of rulers , “ Kings will see and arise , Princes will also bow down , Because of the Lord who is faithful , the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You . ”
23:49:008:0	Thus says the Lord , “ In a favorable time I have answered You , And in a day of salvation I have helped You ; And I will keep You and give You for a covenant of the people , To restore the land , to make them inherit the desolate heritages ;
23:49:009:0	Saying to those who are bound , ‘Go forth , ’To those who are in darkness , ‘Show yourselves . ’Along the roads they will feed , And their pasture will be on all bare heights .
23:49:010:0	They will not hunger or thirst , Nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down ; For He who has compassion on them will lead themAnd will guide them to springs of water .
23:49:011:0	I will make all My mountains a road , And My highways will be raised up .
23:49:012:0	Behold , these will come from afar ; And lo , these will come from the north and from the west , And these from the land of Sinim . ”
23:49:002:1	Promise to Zion
23:49:013:0	Shout for joy , O heavens ! And rejoice , O earth ! Break forth into joyful shouting , O mountains ! For the Lord has comforted His peopleAnd will have compassion on His afflicted .
23:49:014:0	But Zion said , “ The Lord has forsaken me , And the Lord has forgotten me . ”
23:49:015:0	“ Can a woman forget her nursing childAnd have no compassion on the son of her womb ? Even these may forget , but I will not forget you .
23:49:016:0	Behold , I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands ; Your walls are continually before Me .
23:49:017:0	Your builders hurry ; Your destroyers and devastatorsWill depart from you .
23:49:018:0	Lift up your eyes and look around ; All of them gather together , they come to you . As I live , ” declares the Lord , “ You will surely put on all of them as jewels and bind them on as a bride .
23:49:019:0	For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land—Surely now you will be too cramped for the inhabitants , And those who swallowed you will be far away .
23:49:020:0	The children of whom you were bereaved will yet say in your ears , ‘The place is too cramped for me ; Make room for me that I may live here . ’
23:49:021:0	Then you will say in your heart , ‘Who has begotten these for me , Since I have been bereaved of my childrenAnd am barren , an exile and a wanderer ? And who has reared these ? Behold , I was left alone ; From where did these come ? ’ ”
23:49:022:0	Thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I will lift up My hand to the nationsAnd set up My standard to the peoples ; And they will bring your sons in their bosom , And your daughters will be carried on their shoulders .
23:49:023:0	Kings will be your guardians , And their princesses your nurses . They will bow down to you with their faces to the earthAnd lick the dust of your feet ; And you will know that I am the Lord ; Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame .
23:49:024:0	“ Can the prey be taken from the mighty man , Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued ? ”
23:49:025:0	Surely , thus says the Lord , “ Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away , And the prey of the tyrant will be rescued ; For I will contend with the one who contends with you , And I will save your sons .
23:49:026:0	I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh , And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine ; And all flesh will know that I , the Lord , am your SaviorAnd your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob . ”
