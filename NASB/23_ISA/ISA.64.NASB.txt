23:64:001:1	Prayer for Mercy and Help
23:64:001:0	Oh , that You would rend the heavens and come down , That the mountains might quake at Your presence—
23:64:002:0	As fire kindles the brushwood , as fire causes water to boil—To make Your name known to Your adversaries , That the nations may tremble at Your presence !
23:64:003:0	When You did awesome things which we did not expect , You came down , the mountains quaked at Your presence .
23:64:004:0	For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear , Nor has the eye seen a God besides You , Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him .
23:64:005:0	You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness , Who remembers You in Your ways . Behold , You were angry , for we sinned , We continued in them a long time ; And shall we be saved ?
23:64:006:0	For all of us have become like one who is unclean , And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment ; And all of us wither like a leaf , And our iniquities , like the wind , take us away .
23:64:007:0	There is no one who calls on Your name , Who arouses himself to take hold of You ; For You have hidden Your face from usAnd have delivered us into the power of our iniquities .
23:64:008:0	But now , O Lord , You are our Father , We are the clay , and You our potter ; And all of us are the work of Your hand .
23:64:009:0	Do not be angry beyond measure , O Lord , Nor remember iniquity forever ; Behold , look now , all of us are Your people .
23:64:010:0	Your holy cities have become a wilderness , Zion has become a wilderness , Jerusalem a desolation .
23:64:011:0	Our holy and beautiful house , Where our fathers praised You , Has been burned by fire ; And all our precious things have become a ruin .
23:64:012:0	Will You restrain Yourself at these things , O Lord ? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure ?
