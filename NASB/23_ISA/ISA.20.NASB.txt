23:20:001:1	Prophecy about Egypt and Ethiopia
23:20:001:0	In the year that the commander came to Ashdod , when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it ,
23:20:002:0	at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz , saying , “ Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your shoes off your feet . ” And he did so , going naked and barefoot .
23:20:003:0	And the Lord said , “ Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token against Egypt and Cush ,
23:20:004:0	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush , young and old , naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
23:20:005:0	Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast .
23:20:006:0	So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day , ‘Behold , such is our hope , where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria ; and we , how shall we escape ? ’ ”
