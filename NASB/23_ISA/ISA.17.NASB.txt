23:17:001:1	Prophecy about Damascus
23:17:001:0	The oracle concerning Damascus . “ Behold , Damascus is about to be removed from being a cityAnd will become a fallen ruin .
23:17:002:0	The cities of Aroer are forsaken ; They will be for flocks to lie down in , And there will be no one to frighten them .
23:17:003:0	The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim , And sovereignty from DamascusAnd the remnant of Aram ; They will be like the glory of the sons of Israel , ” Declares the Lord of hosts .
23:17:004:0	Now in that day the glory of Jacob will fade , And the fatness of his flesh will become lean .
23:17:005:0	It will be even like the reaper gathering the standing grain , As his arm harvests the ears , Or it will be like one gleaning ears of grainIn the valley of Rephaim .
23:17:006:0	Yet gleanings will be left in it like the shaking of an olive tree , Two or three olives on the topmost bough , Four or five on the branches of a fruitful tree , Declares the Lord , the God of Israel .
23:17:007:0	In that day man will have regard for his MakerAnd his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel .
23:17:008:0	He will not have regard for the altars , the work of his hands , Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made , Even the Asherim and incense stands .
23:17:009:0	In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken places in the forest , Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel ; And the land will be a desolation .
23:17:010:0	For you have forgotten the God of your salvationAnd have not remembered the rock of your refuge . Therefore you plant delightful plantsAnd set them with vine slips of a strange god .
23:17:011:0	In the day that you plant it you carefully fence it in , And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom ; But the harvest will be a heapIn a day of sickliness and incurable pain .
23:17:012:0	Alas , the uproar of many peoplesWho roar like the roaring of the seas , And the rumbling of nationsWho rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters !
23:17:013:0	The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters , But He will rebuke them and they will flee far away , And be chased like chaff in the mountains before the wind , Or like whirling dust before a gale .
23:17:014:0	At evening time , behold , there is terror ! Before morning they are no more . Such will be the portion of those who plunder usAnd the lot of those who pillage us .
