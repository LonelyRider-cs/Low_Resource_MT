23:56:001:1	Rewards for Obedience to God
23:56:001:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Preserve justice and do righteousness , For My salvation is about to comeAnd My righteousness to be revealed .
23:56:002:0	How blessed is the man who does this , And the son of man who takes hold of it ; Who keeps from profaning the sabbath , And keeps his hand from doing any evil . ”
23:56:003:0	Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say , “ The Lord will surely separate me from His people . ” Nor let the eunuch say , “ Behold , I am a dry tree . ”
23:56:004:0	For thus says the Lord , “ To the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths , And choose what pleases Me , And hold fast My covenant ,
23:56:005:0	To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial , And a name better than that of sons and daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off .
23:56:006:0	“ Also the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord , To minister to Him , and to love the name of the Lord , To be His servants , every one who keeps from profaning the sabbathAnd holds fast My covenant ;
23:56:007:0	Even those I will bring to My holy mountainAnd make them joyful in My house of prayer . Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar ; For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples . ”
23:56:008:0	The Lord God , who gathers the dispersed of Israel , declares , “ Yet others I will gather to them , to those already gathered . ”
23:56:009:0	All you beasts of the field , All you beasts in the forest , Come to eat .
23:56:010:0	His watchmen are blind , All of them know nothing . All of them are mute dogs unable to bark , Dreamers lying down , who love to slumber ;
23:56:011:0	And the dogs are greedy , they are not satisfied . And they are shepherds who have no understanding ; They have all turned to their own way , Each one to his unjust gain , to the last one .
23:56:012:0	“ Come , ” they say , “ let us get wine , and let us drink heavily of strong drink ; And tomorrow will be like today , only more so . ”
