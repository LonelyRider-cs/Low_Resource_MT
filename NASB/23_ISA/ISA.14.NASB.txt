23:14:001:1	Israel’s Taunt
23:14:001:0	When the Lord will have compassion on Jacob and again choose Israel , and settle them in their own land , then strangers will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob .
23:14:002:0	The peoples will take them along and bring them to their place , and the house of Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the land of the Lord as male servants and female servants ; and they will take their captors captive and will rule over their oppressors .
23:14:003:0	And it will be in the day when the Lord gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and harsh service in which you have been enslaved ,
23:14:004:0	that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon , and say , “ How the oppressor has ceased , And how fury has ceased !
23:14:005:0	The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked , The scepter of rulers
23:14:006:0	Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes , Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution .
23:14:007:0	The whole earth is at rest and is quiet ; They break forth into shouts of joy .
23:14:008:0	Even the cypress trees rejoice over you , and the cedars of Lebanon , saying , ‘Since you were laid low , no tree cutter comes up against us . ’
23:14:009:0	Sheol from beneath is excited over you to meet you when you come ; It arouses for you the spirits of the dead , all the leaders of the earth ; It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones .
23:14:010:0	They will all respond and say to you , ‘Even you have been made weak as we , You have become like us .
23:14:011:0	Your pomp and the music of your harpsHave been brought down to Sheol ; Maggots are spread out as your bed beneath youAnd worms are your covering . ’
23:14:012:0	How you have fallen from heaven , O star of the morning , son of the dawn ! You have been cut down to the earth , You who have weakened the nations !
23:14:013:0	But you said in your heart , ‘I will ascend to heaven ; I will raise my throne above the stars of God , And I will sit on the mount of assemblyIn the recesses of the north .
23:14:014:0	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; I will make myself like the Most High . ’
23:14:015:0	Nevertheless you will be thrust down to Sheol , To the recesses of the pit .
23:14:016:0	Those who see you will gaze at you , They will ponder over you , saying , ‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble , Who shook kingdoms ,
23:14:017:0	Who made the world like a wildernessAnd overthrew its cities , Who did not allow his prisoners to go home ? ’
23:14:018:0	All the kings of the nations lie in glory , Each in his own tomb .
23:14:019:0	But you have been cast out of your tombLike a rejected branch , Clothed with the slain who are pierced with a sword , Who go down to the stones of the pitLike a trampled corpse .
23:14:020:0	You will not be united with them in burial , Because you have ruined your country , You have slain your people . May the offspring of evildoers not be mentioned forever .
23:14:021:0	Prepare for his sons a place of slaughterBecause of the iniquity of their fathers . They must not arise and take possession of the earthAnd fill the face of the world with cities . ”
23:14:022:0	“ I will rise up against them , ” declares the Lord of hosts , “ and will cut off from Babylon name and survivors , offspring and posterity , ” declares the Lord .
23:14:002:1	Judgment on Assyria
23:14:023:0	“ I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog and swamps of water , and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction , ” declares the Lord of hosts .
23:14:024:0	The Lord of hosts has sworn saying , “ Surely , just as I have intended so it has happened , and just as I have planned so it will stand ,
23:14:025:0	to break Assyria in My land , and I will trample him on My mountains . Then his yoke will be removed from them and his burden removed from their shoulder .
23:14:026:0	This is the plan devised against the whole earth ; and this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations .
23:14:027:0	For the Lord of hosts has planned , and who can frustrate it ? And as for His stretched-out hand , who can turn it back ? ”
23:14:003:1	Judgment on Philistia
23:14:028:0	In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came :
23:14:029:0	“ Do not rejoice , O Philistia , all of you , Because the rod that struck you is broken ; For from the serpent’s root a viper will come out , And its fruit will be a flying serpent .
23:14:030:0	Those who are most helpless will eat , And the needy will lie down in security ; I will destroy your root with famine , And it will kill off your survivors .
23:14:031:0	Wail , O gate ; cry , O city ; Melt away , O Philistia , all of you ; For smoke comes from the north , And there is no straggler in his ranks .
23:14:032:0	How then will one answer the messengers of the nation ? That the Lord has founded Zion , And the afflicted of His people will seek refuge in it . ”
