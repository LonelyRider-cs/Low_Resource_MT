23:6:001:1	Isaiah’s Vision
23:6:001:0	In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne , lofty and exalted , with the train of His robe filling the temple .
23:6:002:0	Seraphim stood above Him , each having six wings : with two he covered his face , and with two he covered his feet , and with two he flew .
23:6:003:0	And one called out to another and said , “ Holy , Holy , Holy , is the Lord of hosts , The whole earth is full of His glory . ”
23:6:004:0	And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out , while the temple was filling with smoke .
23:6:005:0	Then I said , “ Woe is me , for I am ruined ! Because I am a man of unclean lips , And I live among a people of unclean lips ; For my eyes have seen the King , the Lord of hosts . ”
23:6:006:0	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand , which he had taken from the altar with tongs .
23:6:002:1	Isaiah’s Commission
23:6:007:0	He touched my mouth with it and said , “ Behold , this has touched your lips ; and your iniquity is taken away and your sin is forgiven . ”
23:6:008:0	Then I heard the voice of the Lord , saying , “ Whom shall I send , and who will go for Us ? ” Then I said , “ Here am I . Send me ! ”
23:6:009:0	He said , “ Go , and tell this people : ‘Keep on listening , but do not perceive ; Keep on looking , but do not understand . ’
23:6:010:0	Render the hearts of this people insensitive , Their ears dull , And their eyes dim , Otherwise they might see with their eyes , Hear with their ears , Understand with their hearts , And return and be healed . ”
23:6:011:0	Then I said , “ Lord , how long ? ” And He answered , “ Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant , Houses are without peopleAnd the land is utterly desolate ,
23:6:012:0	The Lord has removed men far away , And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land .
23:6:013:0	Yet there will be a tenth portion in it , And it will again be subject to burning , Like a terebinth or an oakWhose stump remains when it is felled . The holy seed is its stump . ”
