23:26:001:1	Song of Trust in God’s Protection
23:26:001:0	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah : “ We have a strong city ; He sets up walls and ramparts for security .
23:26:002:0	Open the gates , that the righteous nation may enter , The one that remains faithful .
23:26:003:0	The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace , Because he trusts in You .
23:26:004:0	Trust in the Lord forever , For in God the Lord , we have an everlasting Rock .
23:26:005:0	For He has brought low those who dwell on high , the unassailable city ; He lays it low , He lays it low to the ground , He casts it to the dust .
23:26:006:0	The foot will trample it , The feet of the afflicted , the steps of the helpless . ”
23:26:007:0	The way of the righteous is smooth ; O Upright One , make the path of the righteous level .
23:26:008:0	Indeed , while following the way of Your judgments , O Lord , We have waited for You eagerly ; Your name , even Your memory , is the desire of our souls .
23:26:009:0	At night my soul longs for You , Indeed , my spirit within me seeks You diligently ; For when the earth experiences Your judgmentsThe inhabitants of the world learn righteousness .
23:26:010:0	Though the wicked is shown favor , He does not learn righteousness ; He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness , And does not perceive the majesty of the Lord .
23:26:011:0	O Lord , Your hand is lifted up yet they do not see it . They see Your zeal for the people and are put to shame ; Indeed , fire will devour Your enemies .
23:26:012:0	Lord , You will establish peace for us , Since You have also performed for us all our works .
23:26:013:0	O Lord our God , other masters besides You have ruled us ; But through You alone we confess Your name .
23:26:014:0	The dead will not live , the departed spirits will not rise ; Therefore You have punished and destroyed them , And You have wiped out all remembrance of them .
23:26:015:0	You have increased the nation , O Lord , You have increased the nation , You are glorified ; You have extended all the borders of the land .
23:26:016:0	O Lord , they sought You in distress ; They could only whisper a prayer , Your chastening was upon them .
23:26:017:0	As the pregnant woman approaches the time to give birth , She writhes and cries out in her labor pains , Thus were we before You , O Lord .
23:26:018:0	We were pregnant , we writhed in labor , We gave birth , as it seems , only to wind . We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth , Nor were inhabitants of the world born .
23:26:019:0	Your dead will live ; Their corpses will rise . You who lie in the dust , awake and shout for joy , For your dew is as the dew of the dawn , And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits .
23:26:020:0	Come , my people , enter into your roomsAnd close your doors behind you ; Hide for a little whileUntil indignation runs its course .
23:26:021:0	For behold , the Lord is about to come out from His placeTo punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity ; And the earth will reveal her bloodshedAnd will no longer cover her slain .
