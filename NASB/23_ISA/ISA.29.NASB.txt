23:29:001:1	Jerusalem Is Warned
23:29:001:0	Woe , O Ariel , Ariel the city where David once camped ! Add year to year , observe your feasts on schedule .
23:29:002:0	I will bring distress to Ariel , And she will be a city of lamenting and mourning ; And she will be like an Ariel to me .
23:29:003:0	I will camp against you encircling you , And I will set siegeworks against you , And I will raise up battle towers against you .
23:29:004:0	Then you will be brought low ; From the earth you will speak , And from the dust where you are prostrateYour words will come . Your voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground , And your speech will whisper from the dust .
23:29:005:0	But the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust , And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away ; And it will happen instantly , suddenly .
23:29:006:0	From the Lord of hosts you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise , With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire .
23:29:007:0	And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel , Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold , and who distress her , Will be like a dream , a vision of the night .
23:29:008:0	It will be as when a hungry man dreams—And behold , he is eating ; But when he awakens , his hunger is not satisfied , Or as when a thirsty man dreams—And behold , he is drinking , But when he awakens , behold , he is faintAnd his thirst is not quenched . Thus the multitude of all the nations will beWho wage war against Mount Zion .
23:29:009:0	Be delayed and wait , Blind yourselves and be blind ; They become drunk , but not with wine , They stagger , but not with strong drink .
23:29:010:0	For the Lord has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep , He has shut your eyes , the prophets ; And He has covered your heads , the seers .
23:29:011:0	The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book , which when they give it to the one who is literate , saying , “ Please read this , ” he will say , “ I cannot , for it is sealed . ”
23:29:012:0	Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate , saying , “ Please read this . ” And he will say , “ I cannot read . ”
23:29:013:0	Then the Lord said , “ Because this people draw near with their wordsAnd honor Me with their lip service , But they remove their hearts far from Me , And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote ,
23:29:014:0	Therefore behold , I will once again deal marvelously with this people , wondrously marvelous ; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish , And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed . ”
23:29:015:0	Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the Lord , And whose deeds are done in a dark place , And they say , “ Who sees us ? ” or “ Who knows us ? ”
23:29:002:1	Blessing after Discipline
23:29:016:0	You turn things around ! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay , That what is made would say to its maker , “ He did not make me ” ; Or what is formed say to him who formed it , “ He has no understanding ” ?
23:29:017:0	Is it not yet just a little whileBefore Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field , And the fertile field will be considered as a forest ?
23:29:018:0	On that day the deaf will hear words of a book , And out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see .
23:29:019:0	The afflicted also will increase their gladness in the Lord , And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
23:29:020:0	For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished , Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be cut off ;
23:29:021:0	Who cause a person to be indicted by a word , And ensnare him who adjudicates at the gate , And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments .
23:29:022:0	Therefore thus says the Lord , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob : “ Jacob shall not now be ashamed , nor shall his face now turn pale ;
23:29:023:0	But when he sees his children , the work of My hands , in his midst , They will sanctify My name ; Indeed , they will sanctify the Holy One of JacobAnd will stand in awe of the God of Israel .
23:29:024:0	Those who err in mind will know the truth , And those who criticize will accept instruction .
