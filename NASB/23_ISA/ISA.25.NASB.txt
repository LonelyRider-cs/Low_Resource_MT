23:25:001:1	Song of Praise for God’s Favor
23:25:001:0	O Lord , You are my God ; I will exalt You , I will give thanks to Your name ; For You have worked wonders , Plans formed long ago , with perfect faithfulness .
23:25:002:0	For You have made a city into a heap , A fortified city into a ruin ; A palace of strangers is a city no more , It will never be rebuilt .
23:25:003:0	Therefore a strong people will glorify You ; Cities of ruthless nations will revere You .
23:25:004:0	For You have been a defense for the helpless , A defense for the needy in his distress , A refuge from the storm , a shade from the heat ; For the breath of the ruthlessIs like a rain storm against a wall .
23:25:005:0	Like heat in drought , You subdue the uproar of aliens ; Like heat by the shadow of a cloud , the song of the ruthless is silenced .
23:25:006:0	The Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain ; A banquet of aged wine , choice pieces with marrow , And refined , aged wine .
23:25:007:0	And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples , Even the veil which is stretched over all nations .
23:25:008:0	He will swallow up death for all time , And the Lord God will wipe tears away from all faces , And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth ; For the Lord has spoken .
23:25:009:0	And it will be said in that day , “ Behold , this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us . This is the Lord for whom we have waited ; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation . ”
23:25:010:0	For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain , And Moab will be trodden down in his placeAs straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile .
23:25:011:0	And he will spread out his hands in the middle of itAs a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim , But the Lord will lay low his pride together with the trickery of his hands .
23:25:012:0	The unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down , Lay low and cast to the ground , even to the dust .
