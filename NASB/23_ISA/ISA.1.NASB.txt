23:1:001:1	Rebellion of God’s People
23:1:001:0	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem , which he saw during the reigns of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
23:1:002:0	Listen , O heavens , and hear , O earth ; For the Lord speaks , “ Sons I have reared and brought up , But they have revolted against Me .
23:1:003:0	An ox knows its owner , And a donkey its master’s manger , But Israel does not know , My people do not understand . ”
23:1:004:0	Alas , sinful nation , People weighed down with iniquity , Offspring of evildoers , Sons who act corruptly ! They have abandoned the Lord , They have despised the Holy One of Israel , They have turned away from Him .
23:1:005:0	Where will you be stricken again , As you continue in your rebellion ? The whole head is sickAnd the whole heart is faint .
23:1:006:0	From the sole of the foot even to the headThere is nothing sound in it , Only bruises , welts and raw wounds , Not pressed out or bandaged , Nor softened with oil .
23:1:007:0	Your land is desolate , Your cities are burned with fire , Your fields—strangers are devouring them in your presence ; It is desolation , as overthrown by strangers .
23:1:008:0	The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard , Like a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field , like a besieged city .
23:1:002:1	God Has Had Enough
23:1:009:0	Unless the Lord of hostsHad left us a few survivors , We would be like Sodom , We would be like Gomorrah .
23:1:010:0	Hear the word of the Lord , You rulers of Sodom ; Give ear to the instruction of our God , You people of Gomorrah .
23:1:011:0	“ What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me ? ” Says the Lord . “ I have had enough of burnt offerings of ramsAnd the fat of fed cattle ; And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls , lambs or goats .
23:1:012:0	When you come to appear before Me , Who requires of you this trampling of My courts ?
23:1:013:0	Bring your worthless offerings no longer , Incense is an abomination to Me . New moon and sabbath , the calling of assemblies—I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly .
23:1:014:0	I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts , They have become a burden to Me ; I am weary of bearing them .
23:1:015:0	So when you spread out your hands in prayer , I will hide My eyes from you ; Yes , even though you multiply prayers , I will not listen . Your hands are covered with blood .
23:1:016:0	“ Wash yourselves , make yourselves clean ; Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight . Cease to do evil ,
23:1:003:1	“ Let Us Reason ”
23:1:017:0	Learn to do good ; Seek justice , Reprove the ruthless , Defend the orphan , Plead for the widow .
23:1:018:0	“ Come now , and let us reason together , ” Says the Lord , “ Though your sins are as scarlet , They will be as white as snow ; Though they are red like crimson , They will be like wool .
23:1:019:0	If you consent and obey , You will eat the best of the land ;
23:1:004:1	Zion Corrupted , to Be Redeemed
23:1:020:0	But if you refuse and rebel , You will be devoured by the sword . ” Truly , the mouth of the Lord has spoken .
23:1:021:0	How the faithful city has become a harlot , She who was full of justice ! Righteousness once lodged in her , But now murderers .
23:1:022:0	Your silver has become dross , Your drink diluted with water .
23:1:023:0	Your rulers are rebelsAnd companions of thieves ; Everyone loves a bribeAnd chases after rewards . They do not defend the orphan , Nor does the widow’s plea come before them .
23:1:024:0	Therefore the Lord God of hosts , The Mighty One of Israel , declares , “ Ah , I will be relieved of My adversariesAnd avenge Myself on My foes .
23:1:025:0	I will also turn My hand against you , And will smelt away your dross as with lyeAnd will remove all your alloy .
23:1:026:0	Then I will restore your judges as at the first , And your counselors as at the beginning ; After that you will be called the city of righteousness , A faithful city . ”
23:1:027:0	Zion will be redeemed with justiceAnd her repentant ones with righteousness .
23:1:028:0	But transgressors and sinners will be crushed together , And those who forsake the Lord will come to an end .
23:1:029:0	Surely you will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired , And you will be embarrassed at the gardens which you have chosen .
23:1:030:0	For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades awayOr as a garden that has no water .
23:1:031:0	The strong man will become tinder , His work also a spark . Thus they shall both burn togetherAnd there will be none to quench them .
