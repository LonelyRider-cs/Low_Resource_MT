23:41:001:1	Israel Encouraged
23:41:001:0	“ Coastlands , listen to Me in silence , And let the peoples gain new strength ; Let them come forward , then let them speak ; Let us come together for judgment .
23:41:002:0	Who has aroused one from the eastWhom He calls in righteousness to His feet ? He delivers up nations before himAnd subdues kings . He makes them like dust with his sword , As the wind-driven chaff with his bow .
23:41:003:0	He pursues them , passing on in safety , By a way he had not been traversing with his feet .
23:41:004:0	Who has performed and accomplished it , Calling forth the generations from the beginning ? ‘I , the Lord , am the first , and with the last . I am He . ’ ”
23:41:005:0	The coastlands have seen and are afraid ; The ends of the earth tremble ; They have drawn near and have come .
23:41:006:0	Each one helps his neighborAnd says to his brother , “ Be strong ! ”
23:41:007:0	So the craftsman encourages the smelter , And he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil , Saying of the soldering , “ It is good ” ; And he fastens it with nails , So that it will not totter .
23:41:008:0	“ But you , Israel , My servant , Jacob whom I have chosen , Descendant of Abraham My friend ,
23:41:009:0	You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , And called from its remotest partsAnd said to you , ‘You are My servant , I have chosen you and not rejected you .
23:41:010:0	Do not fear , for I am with you ; Do not anxiously look about you , for I am your God . I will strengthen you , surely I will help you , Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand . ’
23:41:011:0	Behold , all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored ; Those who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish .
23:41:012:0	You will seek those who quarrel with you , but will not find them , Those who war with you will be as nothing and non-existent .
23:41:013:0	For I am the Lord your God , who upholds your right hand , Who says to you , ‘Do not fear , I will help you . ’
23:41:014:0	Do not fear , you worm Jacob , you men of Israel ; I will help you , ” declares the Lord , “ and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel .
23:41:015:0	Behold , I have made you a new , sharp threshing sledge with double edges ; You will thresh the mountains and pulverize them , And will make the hills like chaff .
23:41:016:0	You will winnow them , and the wind will carry them away , And the storm will scatter them ; But you will rejoice in the Lord , You will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
23:41:017:0	“ The afflicted and needy are seeking water , but there is none , And their tongue is parched with thirst ; I , the Lord , will answer them Myself , As the God of Israel I will not forsake them .
23:41:018:0	I will open rivers on the bare heightsAnd springs in the midst of the valleys ; I will make the wilderness a pool of waterAnd the dry land fountains of water .
23:41:019:0	I will put the cedar in the wilderness , The acacia and the myrtle and the olive tree ; I will place the juniper in the desertTogether with the box tree and the cypress ,
23:41:020:0	That they may see and recognize , And consider and gain insight as well , That the hand of the Lord has done this , And the Holy One of Israel has created it .
23:41:021:0	“ Present your case , ” the Lord says . “ Bring forward your strong arguments , ” The King of Jacob says .
23:41:022:0	Let them bring forth and declare to us what is going to take place ; As for the former events , declare what they were , That we may consider them and know their outcome . Or announce to us what is coming ;
23:41:023:0	Declare the things that are going to come afterward , That we may know that you are gods ; Indeed , do good or evil , that we may anxiously look about us and fear together .
23:41:024:0	Behold , you are of no account , And your work amounts to nothing ; He who chooses you is an abomination .
23:41:025:0	“ I have aroused one from the north , and he has come ; From the rising of the sun he will call on My name ; And he will come upon rulers as upon mortar , Even as the potter treads clay . ”
23:41:026:0	Who has declared this from the beginning , that we might know ? Or from former times , that we may say , “ He is right ! ” ? Surely there was no one who declared , Surely there was no one who proclaimed , Surely there was no one who heard your words .
23:41:027:0	“ Formerly I said to Zion , ‘Behold , here they are . ’And to Jerusalem , ‘I will give a messenger of good news . ’
23:41:028:0	But when I look , there is no one , And there is no counselor among themWho , if I ask , can give an answer .
23:41:029:0	Behold , all of them are false ; Their works are worthless , Their molten images are wind and emptiness .
