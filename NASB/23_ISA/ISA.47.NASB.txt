23:47:001:1	Lament for Babylon
23:47:001:0	“ Come down and sit in the dust , O virgin daughter of Babylon ; Sit on the ground without a throne , O daughter of the Chaldeans ! For you shall no longer be called tender and delicate .
23:47:002:0	Take the millstones and grind meal . Remove your veil , strip off the skirt , Uncover the leg , cross the rivers .
23:47:003:0	Your nakedness will be uncovered , Your shame also will be exposed ; I will take vengeance and will not spare a man . ”
23:47:004:0	Our Redeemer , the Lord of hosts is His name , The Holy One of Israel .
23:47:005:0	“ Sit silently , and go into darkness , O daughter of the Chaldeans , For you will no longer be calledThe queen of kingdoms .
23:47:006:0	I was angry with My people , I profaned My heritageAnd gave them into your hand . You did not show mercy to them , On the aged you made your yoke very heavy .
23:47:007:0	Yet you said , ‘I will be a queen forever . ’These things you did not considerNor remember the outcome of them .
23:47:008:0	“ Now , then , hear this , you sensual one , Who dwells securely , Who says in your heart , ‘I am , and there is no one besides me . I will not sit as a widow , Nor know loss of children . ’
23:47:009:0	But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day : Loss of children and widowhood . They will come on you in full measureIn spite of your many sorceries , In spite of the great power of your spells .
23:47:010:0	You felt secure in your wickedness and said , ‘No one sees me , ’Your wisdom and your knowledge , they have deluded you ; For you have said in your heart , ‘I am , and there is no one besides me . ’
23:47:011:0	But evil will come on youWhich you will not know how to charm away ; And disaster will fall on youFor which you cannot atone ; And destruction about which you do not knowWill come on you suddenly .
23:47:012:0	“ Stand fast now in your spellsAnd in your many sorceriesWith which you have labored from your youth ; Perhaps you will be able to profit , Perhaps you may cause trembling .
23:47:013:0	You are wearied with your many counsels ; Let now the astrologers , Those who prophesy by the stars , Those who predict by the new moons , Stand up and save you from what will come upon you .
23:47:014:0	Behold , they have become like stubble , Fire burns them ; They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame ; There will be no coal to warm by Nor a fire to sit before !
23:47:015:0	So have those become to you with whom you have labored , Who have trafficked with you from your youth ; Each has wandered in his own way ; There is none to save you .
