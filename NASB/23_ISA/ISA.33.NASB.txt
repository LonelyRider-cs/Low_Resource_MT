23:33:001:1	The Judgment of God
23:33:001:0	Woe to you , O destroyer , While you were not destroyed ; And he who is treacherous , while others did not deal treacherously with him . As soon as you finish destroying , you will be destroyed ; As soon as you cease to deal treacherously , others will deal treacherously with you .
23:33:002:0	O Lord , be gracious to us ; we have waited for You . Be their strength every morning , Our salvation also in the time of distress .
23:33:003:0	At the sound of the tumult peoples flee ; At the lifting up of Yourself nations disperse .
23:33:004:0	Your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers ; As locusts rushing about men rush about on it .
23:33:005:0	The Lord is exalted , for He dwells on high ; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness .
23:33:006:0	And He will be the stability of your times , A wealth of salvation , wisdom and knowledge ; The fear of the Lord is his treasure .
23:33:007:0	Behold , their brave men cry in the streets , The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly .
23:33:008:0	The highways are desolate , the traveler has ceased , He has broken the covenant , he has despised the cities , He has no regard for man .
23:33:009:0	The land mourns and pines away , Lebanon is shamed and withers ; Sharon is like a desert plain , And Bashan and Carmel lose their foliage .
23:33:010:0	“ Now I will arise , ” says the Lord , “ Now I will be exalted , now I will be lifted up .
23:33:011:0	You have conceived chaff , you will give birth to stubble ; My breath will consume you like a fire .
23:33:012:0	The peoples will be burned to lime , Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire .
23:33:013:0	“ You who are far away , hear what I have done ; And you who are near , acknowledge My might . ”
23:33:014:0	Sinners in Zion are terrified ; Trembling has seized the godless . “ Who among us can live with the consuming fire ? Who among us can live with continual burning ? ”
23:33:015:0	He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity , He who rejects unjust gainAnd shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe ; He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshedAnd shuts his eyes from looking upon evil ;
23:33:016:0	He will dwell on the heights , His refuge will be the impregnable rock ; His bread will be given him , His water will be sure .
23:33:017:0	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty ; They will behold a far-distant land .
23:33:018:0	Your heart will meditate on terror : “ Where is he who counts ? Where is he who weighs ? Where is he who counts the towers ? ”
23:33:019:0	You will no longer see a fierce people , A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends , Of a stammering tongue which no one understands .
23:33:020:0	Look upon Zion , the city of our appointed feasts ; Your eyes will see Jerusalem , an undisturbed habitation , A tent which will not be folded ; Its stakes will never be pulled up , Nor any of its cords be torn apart .
23:33:021:0	But there the majestic One , the Lord , will be for usA place of rivers and wide canalsOn which no boat with oars will go , And on which no mighty ship will pass—
23:33:022:0	For the Lord is our judge , The Lord is our lawgiver , The Lord is our king ; He will save us—
23:33:023:0	Your tackle hangs slack ; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly , Nor spread out the sail . Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided ; The lame will take the plunder .
23:33:024:0	And no resident will say , “ I am sick ” ; The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity .
