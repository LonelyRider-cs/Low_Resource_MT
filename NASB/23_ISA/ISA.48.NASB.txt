23:48:001:1	Israel’s Obstinacy
23:48:001:0	“ Hear this , O house of Jacob , who are named IsraelAnd who came forth from the loins of Judah , Who swear by the name of the LordAnd invoke the God of Israel , But not in truth nor in righteousness .
23:48:002:0	For they call themselves after the holy cityAnd lean on the God of Israel ; The Lord of hosts is His name .
23:48:003:0	I declared the former things long agoAnd they went forth from My mouth , and I proclaimed them . Suddenly I acted , and they came to pass .
23:48:004:0	Because I know that you are obstinate , And your neck is an iron sinewAnd your forehead bronze ,
23:48:005:0	Therefore I declared them to you long ago , Before they took place I proclaimed them to you , So that you would not say , ‘My idol has done them , And my graven image and my molten image have commanded them . ’
23:48:006:0	You have heard ; look at all this . And you , will you not declare it ? I proclaim to you new things from this time , Even hidden things which you have not known .
23:48:007:0	They are created now and not long ago ; And before today you have not heard them , So that you will not say , ‘Behold , I knew them . ’
23:48:008:0	You have not heard , you have not known . Even from long ago your ear has not been open , Because I knew that you would deal very treacherously ; And you have been called a rebel from birth .
23:48:009:0	For the sake of My name I delay My wrath , And for My praise I restrain it for you , In order not to cut you off .
23:48:010:0	Behold , I have refined you , but not as silver ; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction .
23:48:002:1	Deliverance Promised
23:48:011:0	For My own sake , for My own sake , I will act ; For how can My name be profaned ? And My glory I will not give to another .
23:48:012:0	“ Listen to Me , O Jacob , even Israel whom I called ; I am He , I am the first , I am also the last .
23:48:013:0	Surely My hand founded the earth , And My right hand spread out the heavens ; When I call to them , they stand together .
23:48:014:0	Assemble , all of you , and listen ! Who among them has declared these things ? The Lord loves him ; he will carry out His good pleasure on Babylon , And His arm will be against the Chaldeans .
23:48:015:0	I , even I , have spoken ; indeed I have called him , I have brought him , and He will make his ways successful .
23:48:016:0	Come near to Me , listen to this : From the first I have not spoken in secret , From the time it took place , I was there . And now the Lord God has sent Me , and His Spirit . ”
23:48:017:0	Thus says the Lord , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , “ I am the Lord your God , who teaches you to profit , Who leads you in the way you should go .
23:48:018:0	If only you had paid attention to My commandments ! Then your well-being would have been like a river , And your righteousness like the waves of the sea .
23:48:019:0	Your descendants would have been like the sand , And your offspring like its grains ; Their name would never be cut off or destroyed from My presence . ”
23:48:020:0	Go forth from Babylon ! Flee from the Chaldeans ! Declare with the sound of joyful shouting , proclaim this , Send it out to the end of the earth ; Say , “ The Lord has redeemed His servant Jacob . ”
23:48:021:0	They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts . He made the water flow out of the rock for them ; He split the rock and the water gushed forth .
23:48:022:0	“ There is no peace for the wicked , ” says the Lord .
