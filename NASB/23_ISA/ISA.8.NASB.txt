23:8:001:1	Damascus and Samaria Fall
23:8:001:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Take for yourself a large tablet and write on it in ordinary letters : Swift is the booty , speedy is the prey .
23:8:002:0	And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony , Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah . ”
23:8:003:0	So I approached the prophetess , and she conceived and gave birth to a son . Then the Lord said to me , “ Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz ;
23:8:004:0	for before the boy knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother , ’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria . ”
23:8:005:0	Again the Lord spoke to me further , saying ,
23:8:006:0	“ Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of ShiloahAnd rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah ;
23:8:007:0	Now therefore , behold , the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates , Even the king of Assyria and all his glory ; And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks .
23:8:002:1	A Believing Remnant
23:8:008:0	Then it will sweep on into Judah , it will overflow and pass through , It will reach even to the neck ; And the spread of its wings will fill the breadth of your land , O Immanuel .
23:8:009:0	“ Be broken , O peoples , and be shattered ; And give ear , all remote places of the earth . Gird yourselves , yet be shattered ; Gird yourselves , yet be shattered .
23:8:010:0	Devise a plan , but it will be thwarted ; State a proposal , but it will not stand , For God is with us . ”
23:8:011:0	For thus the Lord spoke to me with mighty power and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
23:8:012:0	“ You are not to say , ‘It is a conspiracy ! ’In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy , And you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of it .
23:8:013:0	It is the Lord of hosts whom you should regard as holy . And He shall be your fear , And He shall be your dread .
23:8:014:0	Then He shall become a sanctuary ; But to both the houses of Israel , a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over , And a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
23:8:015:0	Many will stumble over them , Then they will fall and be broken ; They will even be snared and caught . ”
23:8:016:0	Bind up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples .
23:8:017:0	And I will wait for the Lord who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob ; I will even look eagerly for Him .
23:8:018:0	Behold , I and the children whom the Lord has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , who dwells on Mount Zion .
23:8:019:0	When they say to you , “ Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter , ” should not a people consult their God ? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living ?
23:8:020:0	To the law and to the testimony ! If they do not speak according to this word , it is because they have no dawn .
23:8:021:0	They will pass through the land hard-pressed and famished , and it will turn out that when they are hungry , they will be enraged and curse their king and their God as they face upward .
23:8:022:0	Then they will look to the earth , and behold , distress and darkness , the gloom of anguish ; and they will be driven away into darkness .
