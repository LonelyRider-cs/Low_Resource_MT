23:28:001:1	Ephraim’s Captivity Predicted
23:28:001:0	Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim , And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty , Which is at the head of the fertile valleyOf those who are overcome with wine !
23:28:002:0	Behold , the Lord has a strong and mighty agent ; As a storm of hail , a tempest of destruction , Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters , He has cast it down to the earth with His hand .
23:28:003:0	The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot .
23:28:004:0	And the fading flower of its glorious beauty , Which is at the head of the fertile valley , Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer , Which one sees , And as soon as it is in his hand , He swallows it .
23:28:005:0	In that day the Lord of hosts will become a beautiful crownAnd a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people ;
23:28:006:0	A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment , A strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate .
23:28:007:0	And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink : The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink , They are confused by wine , they stagger from strong drink ; They reel while having visions , They totter when rendering judgment .
23:28:008:0	For all the tables are full of filthy vomit , without a single clean place .
23:28:009:0	“ To whom would He teach knowledge , And to whom would He interpret the message ? Those just weaned from milk ? Those just taken from the breast ?
23:28:010:0	For He says , ‘Order on order , order on order , Line on line , line on line , A little here , a little there . ’ ”
23:28:011:0	Indeed , He will speak to this peopleThrough stammering lips and a foreign tongue ,
23:28:012:0	He who said to them , “ Here is rest , give rest to the weary , ” And , “ Here is repose , ” but they would not listen .
23:28:002:1	Judah Is Warned
23:28:013:0	So the word of the Lord to them will be , “ Order on order , order on order , Line on line , line on line , A little here , a little there , ” That they may go and stumble backward , be broken , snared and taken captive .
23:28:014:0	Therefore , hear the word of the Lord , O scoffers , Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem ,
23:28:015:0	Because you have said , “ We have made a covenant with death , And with Sheol we have made a pact . The overwhelming scourge will not reach us when it passes by , For we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception . ”
23:28:016:0	Therefore thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , I am laying in Zion a stone , a tested stone , A costly cornerstone for the foundation , firmly placed . He who believes in it will not be disturbed .
23:28:017:0	I will make justice the measuring lineAnd righteousness the level ; Then hail will sweep away the refuge of liesAnd the waters will overflow the secret place .
23:28:018:0	Your covenant with death will be canceled , And your pact with Sheol will not stand ; When the overwhelming scourge passes through , Then you become its trampling place .
23:28:019:0	As often as it passes through , it will seize you ; For morning after morning it will pass through , anytime during the day or night , And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means . ”
23:28:020:0	The bed is too short on which to stretch out , And the blanket is too small to wrap oneself in .
23:28:021:0	For the Lord will rise up as at Mount Perazim , He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon , To do His task , His unusual task , And to work His work , His extraordinary work .
23:28:022:0	And now do not carry on as scoffers , Or your fetters will be made stronger ; For I have heard from the Lord God of hostsOf decisive destruction on all the earth .
23:28:023:0	Give ear and hear my voice , Listen and hear my words .
23:28:024:0	Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed ? Does he continually turn and harrow the ground ?
23:28:025:0	Does he not level its surfaceAnd sow dill and scatter cumminAnd plant wheat in rows , Barley in its place and rye within its area ?
23:28:026:0	For his God instructs and teaches him properly .
23:28:027:0	For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge , Nor is the cartwheel driven over cummin ; But dill is beaten out with a rod , and cummin with a club .
23:28:028:0	Grain for bread is crushed , Indeed , he does not continue to thresh it forever . Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually damage it , He does not thresh it longer .
23:28:029:0	This also comes from the Lord of hosts , Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great .
