23:13:001:1	Prophecies about Babylon
23:13:001:0	The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw .
23:13:002:0	Lift up a standard on the bare hill , Raise your voice to them , Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles .
23:13:003:0	I have commanded My consecrated ones , I have even called My mighty warriors , My proudly exulting ones , To execute My anger .
23:13:004:0	A sound of tumult on the mountains , Like that of many people ! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms , Of nations gathered together ! The Lord of hosts is mustering the army for battle .

23:13:005:0	They are coming from a far country , From the farthest horizons , The Lord and His instruments of indignation , To destroy the whole land .
23:13:006:0	Wail , for the day of the Lord is near ! It will come as destruction from the Almighty .
23:13:007:0	Therefore all hands will fall limp , And every man’s heart will melt .
23:13:008:0	They will be terrified , Pains and anguish will take hold of them ; They will writhe like a woman in labor , They will look at one another in astonishment , Their faces aflame .
23:13:009:0	Behold , the day of the Lord is coming , Cruel , with fury and burning anger , To make the land a desolation ; And He will exterminate its sinners from it .
23:13:010:0	For the stars of heaven and their constellationsWill not flash forth their light ; The sun will be dark when it risesAnd the moon will not shed its light .
23:13:011:0	Thus I will punish the world for its evilAnd the wicked for their iniquity ; I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proudAnd abase the haughtiness of the ruthless .
23:13:012:0	I will make mortal man scarcer than pure goldAnd mankind than the gold of Ophir .
23:13:013:0	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble , And the earth will be shaken from its placeAt the fury of the Lord of hostsIn the day of His burning anger .
23:13:014:0	And it will be that like a hunted gazelle , Or like sheep with none to gather them , They will each turn to his own people , And each one flee to his own land .
23:13:015:0	Anyone who is found will be thrust through , And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword .
23:13:004:1	Babylon Will Fall to the Medes
23:13:016:0	Their little ones also will be dashed to piecesBefore their eyes ; Their houses will be plunderedAnd their wives ravished .
23:13:017:0	Behold , I am going to stir up the Medes against them , Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold .
23:13:018:0	And their bows will mow down the young men , They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb , Nor will their eye pity children .
23:13:019:0	And Babylon , the beauty of kingdoms , the glory of the Chaldeans’ pride , Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .
23:13:020:0	It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation ; Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there , Nor will shepherds make their flocks lie down there .
23:13:021:0	But desert creatures will lie down there , And their houses will be full of owls ; Ostriches also will live there , and shaggy goats will frolic there .
23:13:022:0	Hyenas will howl in their fortified towersAnd jackals in their luxurious palaces . Her fateful time also will soon comeAnd her days will not be prolonged .
