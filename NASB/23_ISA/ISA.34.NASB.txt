23:34:001:1	God’s Wrath against Nations
23:34:001:0	Draw near , O nations , to hear ; and listen , O peoples ! Let the earth and all it contains hear , and the world and all that springs from it .
23:34:002:0	For the Lord’s indignation is against all the nations , And His wrath against all their armies ; He has utterly destroyed them , He has given them over to slaughter .
23:34:003:0	So their slain will be thrown out , And their corpses will give off their stench , And the mountains will be drenched with their blood .
23:34:004:0	And all the host of heaven will wear away , And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll ; All their hosts will also wither awayAs a leaf withers from the vine , Or as one withers from the fig tree .
23:34:005:0	For My sword is satiated in heaven , Behold it shall descend for judgment upon EdomAnd upon the people whom I have devoted to destruction .
23:34:006:0	The sword of the Lord is filled with blood , It is sated with fat , with the blood of lambs and goats , With the fat of the kidneys of rams . For the Lord has a sacrifice in BozrahAnd a great slaughter in the land of Edom .
23:34:007:0	Wild oxen will also fall with themAnd young bulls with strong ones ; Thus their land will be soaked with blood , And their dust become greasy with fat .
23:34:008:0	For the Lord has a day of vengeance , A year of recompense for the cause of Zion .
23:34:009:0	Its streams will be turned into pitch , And its loose earth into brimstone , And its land will become burning pitch .
23:34:010:0	It will not be quenched night or day ; Its smoke will go up forever . From generation to generation it will be desolate ; None will pass through it forever and ever .
23:34:011:0	But pelican and hedgehog will possess it , And owl and raven will dwell in it ; And He will stretch over it the line of desolationAnd the plumb line of emptiness .
23:34:012:0	Its nobles—there is no one there Whom they may proclaim king—And all its princes will be nothing .
23:34:013:0	Thorns will come up in its fortified towers , Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities ; It will also be a haunt of jackals And an abode of ostriches .
23:34:014:0	The desert creatures will meet with the wolves , The hairy goat also will cry to its kind ; Yes , the night monster will settle thereAnd will find herself a resting place .
23:34:015:0	The tree snake will make its nest and lay eggs there , And it will hatch and gather them under its protection . Yes , the hawks will be gathered there , Every one with its kind .
23:34:016:0	Seek from the book of the Lord , and read : Not one of these will be missing ; None will lack its mate . For His mouth has commanded , And His Spirit has gathered them .
23:34:017:0	He has cast the lot for them , And His hand has divided it to them by line . They shall possess it forever ; From generation to generation they will dwell in it .
