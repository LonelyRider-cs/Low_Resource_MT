23:16:001:1	Prophecy of Moab’s Devastation
23:16:001:0	Send the tribute lamb to the ruler of the land , From Sela by way of the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion .
23:16:002:0	Then , like fleeing birds or scattered nestlings , The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon .
23:16:003:0	“ Give us advice , make a decision ; Cast your shadow like night at high noon ; Hide the outcasts , do not betray the fugitive .
23:16:004:0	Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you ; Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer . ” For the extortioner has come to an end , destruction has ceased , Oppressors have completely disappeared from the land .
23:16:005:0	A throne will even be established in lovingkindness , And a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David ; Moreover , he will seek justiceAnd be prompt in righteousness .
23:16:006:0	We have heard of the pride of Moab , an excessive pride ; Even of his arrogance , pride , and fury ; His idle boasts are false .
23:16:007:0	Therefore Moab will wail ; everyone of Moab will wail . You will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-haresethAs those who are utterly stricken .
23:16:008:0	For the fields of Heshbon have withered , the vines of Sibmah as well ; The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clustersWhich reached as far as Jazer and wandered to the deserts ; Its tendrils spread themselves out and passed over the sea .
23:16:009:0	Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer , for the vine of Sibmah ; I will drench you with my tears , O Heshbon and Elealeh ; For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away .
23:16:010:0	Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field ; In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting , No treader treads out wine in the presses , For I have made the shouting to cease .
23:16:011:0	Therefore my heart intones like a harp for MoabAnd my inward feelings for Kir-hareseth .
23:16:012:0	So it will come about when Moab presents himself , When he wearies himself upon his high placeAnd comes to his sanctuary to pray , That he will not prevail .
23:16:013:0	This is the word which the Lord spoke earlier concerning Moab .
23:16:014:0	But now the Lord speaks , saying , “ Within three years , as a hired man would count them , the glory of Moab will be degraded along with all his great population , and his remnant will be very small and impotent . ”
