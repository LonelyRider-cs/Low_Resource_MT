23:32:001:1	The Glorious Future
23:32:001:0	Behold , a king will reign righteouslyAnd princes will rule justly .
23:32:002:0	Each will be like a refuge from the windAnd a shelter from the storm , Like streams of water in a dry country , Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land .
23:32:003:0	Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded , And the ears of those who hear will listen .
23:32:004:0	The mind of the hasty will discern the truth , And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly .
23:32:005:0	No longer will the fool be called noble , Or the rogue be spoken of as generous .
23:32:006:0	For a fool speaks nonsense , And his heart inclines toward wickedness : To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the Lord , To keep the hungry person unsatisfiedAnd to withhold drink from the thirsty .
23:32:007:0	As for a rogue , his weapons are evil ; He devises wicked schemesTo destroy the afflicted with slander , Even though the needy one speaks what is right .
23:32:008:0	But the noble man devises noble plans ; And by noble plans he stands .
23:32:009:0	Rise up , you women who are at ease , And hear my voice ; Give ear to my word , You complacent daughters .
23:32:010:0	Within a year and a few daysYou will be troubled , O complacent daughters ; For the vintage is ended , And the fruit gathering will not come .
23:32:011:0	Tremble , you women who are at ease ; Be troubled , you complacent daughters ; Strip , undress and put sackcloth on your waist ,
23:32:012:0	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine ,
23:32:013:0	For the land of my people in which thorns and briars shall come up ; Yea , for all the joyful houses and for the jubilant city .
23:32:014:0	Because the palace has been abandoned , the populated city forsaken . Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever , A delight for wild donkeys , a pasture for flocks ;
23:32:015:0	Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high , And the wilderness becomes a fertile field , And the fertile field is considered as a forest .
23:32:016:0	Then justice will dwell in the wildernessAnd righteousness will abide in the fertile field .
23:32:017:0	And the work of righteousness will be peace , And the service of righteousness , quietness and confidence forever .
23:32:018:0	Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation , And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places ;
23:32:019:0	And it will hail when the forest comes down , And the city will be utterly laid low .
23:32:020:0	How blessed will you be , you who sow beside all waters , Who let out freely the ox and the donkey .
