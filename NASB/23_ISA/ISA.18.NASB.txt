23:18:001:1	Message to Ethiopia
23:18:001:0	Alas , oh land of whirring wingsWhich lies beyond the rivers of Cush ,
23:18:002:0	Which sends envoys by the sea , Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters . Go , swift messengers , to a nation tall and smooth , To a people feared far and wide , A powerful and oppressive nationWhose land the rivers divide .
23:18:003:0	All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth , As soon as a standard is raised on the mountains , you will see it , And as soon as the trumpet is blown , you will hear it .
23:18:004:0	For thus the Lord has told me , “ I will look from My dwelling place quietlyLike dazzling heat in the sunshine , Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest . ”
23:18:005:0	For before the harvest , as soon as the bud blossomsAnd the flower becomes a ripening grape , Then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knivesAnd remove and cut away the spreading branches .
23:18:006:0	They will be left together for mountain birds of prey , And for the beasts of the earth ; And the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them , And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them .
23:18:007:0	At that time a gift of homage will be brought to the Lord of hostsFrom a people tall and smooth , Even from a people feared far and wide , A powerful and oppressive nation , Whose land the rivers divide—To the place of the name of the Lord of hosts , even Mount Zion .
