23:23:001:1	The Fall of Tyre
23:23:001:0	The oracle concerning Tyre . Wail , O ships of Tarshish , For Tyre is destroyed , without house or harbor ; It is reported to them from the land of Cyprus .
23:23:002:0	Be silent , you inhabitants of the coastland , You merchants of Sidon ; Your messengers crossed the sea
23:23:003:0	And were on many waters . The grain of the Nile , the harvest of the River was her revenue ; And she was the market of nations .
23:23:004:0	Be ashamed , O Sidon ; For the sea speaks , the stronghold of the sea , saying , “ I have neither travailed nor given birth , I have neither brought up young men nor reared virgins . ”
23:23:005:0	When the report reaches Egypt , They will be in anguish at the report of Tyre .
23:23:006:0	Pass over to Tarshish ; Wail , O inhabitants of the coastland .
23:23:007:0	Is this your jubilant city , Whose origin is from antiquity , Whose feet used to carry her to colonize distant places ?
23:23:008:0	Who has planned this against Tyre , the bestower of crowns , Whose merchants were princes , whose traders were the honored of the earth ?
23:23:009:0	The Lord of hosts has planned it , to defile the pride of all beauty , To despise all the honored of the earth .
23:23:010:0	Overflow your land like the Nile , O daughter of Tarshish , There is no more restraint .
23:23:011:0	He has stretched His hand out over the sea , He has made the kingdoms tremble ; The Lord has given a command concerning Canaan to demolish its strongholds .
23:23:012:0	He has said , “ You shall exult no more , O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon . Arise , pass over to Cyprus ; even there you will find no rest . ”
23:23:013:0	Behold , the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people which was not ; Assyria appointed it for desert creatures—they erected their siege towers , they stripped its palaces , they made it a ruin .
23:23:014:0	Wail , O ships of Tarshish , For your stronghold is destroyed .
23:23:015:0	Now in that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king . At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot :
23:23:016:0	Take your harp , walk about the city , O forgotten harlot ; Pluck the strings skillfully , sing many songs , That you may be remembered .
23:23:017:0	It will come about at the end of seventy years that the Lord will visit Tyre . Then she will go back to her harlot’s wages and will play the harlot with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth .
23:23:018:0	Her gain and her harlot’s wages will be set apart to the Lord ; it will not be stored up or hoarded , but her gain will become sufficient food and choice attire for those who dwell in the presence of the Lord .
