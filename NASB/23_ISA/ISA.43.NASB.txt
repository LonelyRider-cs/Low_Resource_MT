23:43:001:1	Israel Redeemed
23:43:001:0	But now , thus says the Lord , your Creator , O Jacob , And He who formed you , O Israel , “ Do not fear , for I have redeemed you ; I have called you by name ; you are Mine !
23:43:002:0	When you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; And through the rivers , they will not overflow you . When you walk through the fire , you will not be scorched , Nor will the flame burn you .
23:43:003:0	For I am the Lord your God , The Holy One of Israel , your Savior ; I have given Egypt as your ransom , Cush and Seba in your place .
23:43:004:0	Since you are precious in My sight , Since you are honored and I love you , I will give other men in your place and other peoples in exchange for your life .
23:43:005:0	Do not fear , for I am with you ; I will bring your offspring from the east , And gather you from the west .
23:43:006:0	I will say to the north , ‘Give them up ! ’And to the south , ‘Do not hold them back . ’Bring My sons from afarAnd My daughters from the ends of the earth ,
23:43:002:1	Israel Is God’s Witness
23:43:007:0	Everyone who is called by My name , And whom I have created for My glory , Whom I have formed , even whom I have made . ”
23:43:008:0	Bring out the people who are blind , even though they have eyes , And the deaf , even though they have ears .
23:43:009:0	All the nations have gathered togetherSo that the peoples may be assembled . Who among them can declare thisAnd proclaim to us the former things ? Let them present their witnesses that they may be justified , Or let them hear and say , “ It is true . ”
23:43:010:0	“ You are My witnesses , ” declares the Lord , “ And My servant whom I have chosen , So that you may know and believe MeAnd understand that I am He . Before Me there was no God formed , And there will be none after Me .
23:43:011:0	I , even I , am the Lord , And there is no savior besides Me .
23:43:012:0	It is I who have declared and saved and proclaimed , And there was no strange god among you ; So you are My witnesses , ” declares the Lord , “ And I am God .
23:43:003:1	Babylon to Be Destroyed
23:43:013:0	Even from eternity I am He , And there is none who can deliver out of My hand ; I act and who can reverse it ? ”
23:43:014:0	Thus says the Lord your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , “ For your sake I have sent to Babylon , And will bring them all down as fugitives , Even the Chaldeans , into the ships in which they rejoice .
23:43:015:0	I am the Lord , your Holy One , The Creator of Israel , your King . ”
23:43:016:0	Thus says the Lord , Who makes a way through the seaAnd a path through the mighty waters ,
23:43:017:0	Who brings forth the chariot and the horse , The army and the mighty man ( They will lie down together and not rise again ; They have been quenched and extinguished like a wick ) :
23:43:018:0	“ Do not call to mind the former things , Or ponder things of the past .
23:43:019:0	Behold , I will do something new , Now it will spring forth ; Will you not be aware of it ? I will even make a roadway in the wilderness , Rivers in the desert .
23:43:020:0	The beasts of the field will glorify Me , The jackals and the ostriches , Because I have given waters in the wildernessAnd rivers in the desert , To give drink to My chosen people .
23:43:004:1	The Shortcomings of Israel
23:43:021:0	The people whom I formed for MyselfWill declare My praise .
23:43:022:0	“ Yet you have not called on Me , O Jacob ; But you have become weary of Me , O Israel .
23:43:023:0	You have not brought to Me the sheep of your burnt offerings , Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , Nor wearied you with incense .
23:43:024:0	You have bought Me not sweet cane with money , Nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices ; Rather you have burdened Me with your sins , You have wearied Me with your iniquities .
23:43:025:0	“ I , even I , am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake , And I will not remember your sins .
23:43:026:0	Put Me in remembrance , let us argue our case together ; State your cause , that you may be proved right .
23:43:027:0	Your first forefather sinned , And your spokesmen have transgressed against Me .
23:43:028:0	So I will pollute the princes of the sanctuary , And I will consign Jacob to the ban and Israel to revilement .
