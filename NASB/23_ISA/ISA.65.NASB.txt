23:65:001:1	A Rebellious People
23:65:001:0	“ I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me ; I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me . I said , ‘Here am I , here am I , ’To a nation which did not call on My name .
23:65:002:0	I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people , Who walk in the way which is not good , following their own thoughts ,
23:65:003:0	A people who continually provoke Me to My face , Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks ;
23:65:004:0	Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places ; Who eat swine’s flesh , And the broth of unclean meat is in their pots .
23:65:005:0	Who say , ‘Keep to yourself , do not come near me , For I am holier than you ! ’These are smoke in My nostrils , A fire that burns all the day .
23:65:006:0	Behold , it is written before Me , I will not keep silent , but I will repay ; I will even repay into their bosom ,
23:65:007:0	Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together , ” says the Lord . “ Because they have burned incense on the mountainsAnd scorned Me on the hills , Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom . ”
23:65:008:0	Thus says the Lord , “ As the new wine is found in the cluster , And one says , ‘Do not destroy it , for there is benefit in it , ’So I will act on behalf of My servantsIn order not to destroy all of them .
23:65:009:0	I will bring forth offspring from Jacob , And an heir of My mountains from Judah ; Even My chosen ones shall inherit it , And My servants will dwell there .
23:65:010:0	Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks , And the valley of Achor a resting place for herds , For My people who seek Me .
23:65:011:0	But you who forsake the Lord , Who forget My holy mountain , Who set a table for Fortune , And who fill cups with mixed wine for Destiny ,
23:65:012:0	I will destine you for the sword , And all of you will bow down to the slaughter . Because I called , but you did not answer ; I spoke , but you did not hear . And you did evil in My sightAnd chose that in which I did not delight . ”
23:65:013:0	Therefore , thus says the Lord God , “ Behold , My servants will eat , but you will be hungry . Behold , My servants will drink , but you will be thirsty . Behold , My servants will rejoice , but you will be put to shame .
23:65:014:0	Behold , My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart , But you will cry out with a heavy heart , And you will wail with a broken spirit .
23:65:015:0	You will leave your name for a curse to My chosen ones , And the Lord God will slay you . But My servants will be called by another name .
23:65:002:1	New Heavens and a New Earth
23:65:016:0	Because he who is blessed in the earthWill be blessed by the God of truth ; And he who swears in the earthWill swear by the God of truth ; Because the former troubles are forgotten , And because they are hidden from My sight !
23:65:017:0	“ For behold , I create new heavens and a new earth ; And the former things will not be remembered or come to mind .
23:65:018:0	But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create ; For behold , I create Jerusalem for rejoicingAnd her people for gladness .
23:65:019:0	I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people ; And there will no longer be heard in herThe voice of weeping and the sound of crying .
23:65:020:0	No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days , Or an old man who does not live out his days ; For the youth will die at the age of one hundredAnd the one who does not reach the age of one hundredWill be thought accursed .
23:65:021:0	They will build houses and inhabit them ; They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
23:65:022:0	They will not build and another inhabit , They will not plant and another eat ; For as the lifetime of a tree , so will be the days of My people , And My chosen ones will wear out the work of their hands .
23:65:023:0	They will not labor in vain , Or bear children for calamity ; For they are the offspring of those blessed by the Lord , And their descendants with them .
23:65:024:0	It will also come to pass that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are still speaking , I will hear .
23:65:025:0	The wolf and the lamb will graze together , and the lion will eat straw like the ox ; and dust will be the serpent’s food . They will do no evil or harm in all My holy mountain , ” says the Lord .
