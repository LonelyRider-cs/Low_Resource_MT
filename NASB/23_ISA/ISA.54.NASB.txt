23:54:001:1	The Fertility of Zion
23:54:001:0	“ Shout for joy , O barren one , you who have borne no child ; Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud , you who have not travailed ; For the sons of the desolate one will be more numerousThan the sons of the married woman , ” says the Lord .
23:54:002:0	“ Enlarge the place of your tent ; Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings , spare not ; Lengthen your cordsAnd strengthen your pegs .
23:54:003:0	For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left . And your descendants will possess nationsAnd will resettle the desolate cities .
23:54:004:0	“ Fear not , for you will not be put to shame ; And do not feel humiliated , for you will not be disgraced ; But you will forget the shame of your youth , And the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more .
23:54:005:0	For your husband is your Maker , Whose name is the Lord of hosts ; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel , Who is called the God of all the earth .
23:54:006:0	For the Lord has called you , Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit , Even like a wife of one’s youth when she is rejected , ” Says your God .
23:54:007:0	“ For a brief moment I forsook you , But with great compassion I will gather you .
23:54:008:0	In an outburst of angerI hid My face from you for a moment , But with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you , ” Says the Lord your Redeemer .
23:54:009:0	“ For this is like the days of Noah to Me , When I swore that the waters of NoahWould not flood the earth again ; So I have sworn that I will not be angry with youNor will I rebuke you .
23:54:010:0	For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake , But My lovingkindness will not be removed from you , And My covenant of peace will not be shaken , ” Says the Lord who has compassion on you .
23:54:011:0	“ O afflicted one , storm-tossed , and not comforted , Behold , I will set your stones in antimony , And your foundations I will lay in sapphires .
23:54:012:0	Moreover , I will make your battlements of rubies , And your gates of crystal , And your entire wall of precious stones .
23:54:013:0	All your sons will be taught of the Lord ; And the well-being of your sons will be great .
23:54:014:0	In righteousness you will be established ; You will be far from oppression , for you will not fear ; And from terror , for it will not come near you .
23:54:015:0	If anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me . Whoever assails you will fall because of you .
23:54:016:0	Behold , I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coalsAnd brings out a weapon for its work ; And I have created the destroyer to ruin .
23:54:017:0	No weapon that is formed against you will prosper ; And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn . This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord , And their vindication is from Me , ” declares the Lord .
