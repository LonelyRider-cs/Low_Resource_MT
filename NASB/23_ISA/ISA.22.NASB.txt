23:22:001:1	The Valley of Vision
23:22:001:0	The oracle concerning the valley of vision . What is the matter with you now , that you have all gone up to the housetops ?
23:22:002:0	You who were full of noise , You boisterous town , you exultant city ; Your slain were not slain with the sword , Nor did they die in battle .
23:22:003:0	All your rulers have fled together , And have been captured without the bow ; All of you who were found were taken captive together , Though they had fled far away .
23:22:004:0	Therefore I say , “ Turn your eyes away from me , Let me weep bitterly , Do not try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people . ”
23:22:005:0	For the Lord God of hosts has a day of panic , subjugation and confusionIn the valley of vision , A breaking down of wallsAnd a crying to the mountain .
23:22:006:0	Elam took up the quiverWith the chariots , infantry and horsemen ; And Kir uncovered the shield .
23:22:007:0	Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots , And the horsemen took up fixed positions at the gate .
23:22:008:0	And He removed the defense of Judah . In that day you depended on the weapons of the house of the forest ,
23:22:009:0	And you saw that the breachesIn the wall of the city of David were many ; And you collected the waters of the lower pool .
23:22:010:0	Then you counted the houses of JerusalemAnd tore down houses to fortify the wall .
23:22:011:0	And you made a reservoir between the two wallsFor the waters of the old pool . But you did not depend on Him who made it , Nor did you take into consideration Him who planned it long ago .
23:22:012:0	Therefore in that day the Lord God of hosts called you to weeping , to wailing , To shaving the head and to wearing sackcloth .
23:22:013:0	Instead , there is gaiety and gladness , Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep , Eating of meat and drinking of wine : “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we may die . ”
23:22:014:0	But the Lord of hosts revealed Himself to me , “ Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven youUntil you die , ” says the Lord God of hosts .
23:22:015:0	Thus says the Lord God of hosts , “ Come , go to this steward , To Shebna , who is in charge of the royal household ,
23:22:016:0	‘What right do you have here , And whom do you have here , That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here , You who hew a tomb on the height , You who carve a resting place for yourself in the rock ?
23:22:017:0	Behold , the Lord is about to hurl you headlong , O man . And He is about to grasp you firmly
23:22:018:0	And roll you tightly like a ball , To be cast into a vast country ; There you will dieAnd there your splendid chariots will be , You shame of your master’s house . ’
23:22:019:0	I will depose you from your office , And I will pull you down from your station .
23:22:020:0	Then it will come about in that day , That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah ,
23:22:021:0	And I will clothe him with your tunicAnd tie your sash securely about him . I will entrust him with your authority , And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah .
23:22:022:0	Then I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder , When he opens no one will shut , When he shuts no one will open .
23:22:023:0	I will drive him like a peg in a firm place , And he will become a throne of glory to his father’s house .
23:22:024:0	So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house , offspring and issue , all the least of vessels , from bowls to all the jars .
23:22:025:0	In that day , ” declares the Lord of hosts , “ the peg driven in a firm place will give way ; it will even break off and fall , and the load hanging on it will be cut off , for the Lord has spoken . ”
