23:19:001:1	Message to Egypt
23:19:001:0	The oracle concerning Egypt . Behold , the Lord is riding on a swift cloud and is about to come to Egypt ; The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence , And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them .
23:19:002:0	“ So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians ; And they will each fight against his brother and each against his neighbor , City against city and kingdom against kingdom .
23:19:003:0	Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them ; And I will confound their strategy , So that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the deadAnd to mediums and spiritists .
23:19:004:0	Moreover , I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master , And a mighty king will rule over them , ” declares the Lord God of hosts .
23:19:005:0	The waters from the sea will dry up , And the river will be parched and dry .
23:19:006:0	The canals will emit a stench , The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up ; The reeds and rushes will rot away .
23:19:007:0	The bulrushes by the Nile , by the edge of the NileAnd all the sown fields by the NileWill become dry , be driven away , and be no more .
23:19:008:0	And the fishermen will lament , And all those who cast a line into the Nile will mourn , And those who spread nets on the waters will pine away .
23:19:009:0	Moreover , the manufacturers of linen made from combed flaxAnd the weavers of white cloth will be utterly dejected .
23:19:010:0	And the pillars of Egypt will be crushed ; All the hired laborers will be grieved in soul .
23:19:011:0	The princes of Zoan are mere fools ; The advice of Pharaoh’s wisest advisers has become stupid . How can you men say to Pharaoh , “ I am a son of the wise , a son of ancient kings ” ?
23:19:012:0	Well then , where are your wise men ? Please let them tell you , And let them understand what the Lord of hostsHas purposed against Egypt .
23:19:013:0	The princes of Zoan have acted foolishly , The princes of Memphis are deluded ; Those who are the cornerstone of her tribesHave led Egypt astray .
23:19:014:0	The Lord has mixed within her a spirit of distortion ; They have led Egypt astray in all that it does , As a drunken man staggers in his vomit .
23:19:015:0	There will be no work for EgyptWhich its head or tail , its palm branch or bulrush , may do .
23:19:016:0	In that day the Egyptians will become like women , and they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which He is going to wave over them .
23:19:017:0	The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt ; everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in dread of it , because of the purpose of the Lord of hosts which He is purposing against them .
23:19:018:0	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing allegiance to the Lord of hosts ; one will be called the City of Destruction .
23:19:019:0	In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar to the Lord near its border .
23:19:020:0	It will become a sign and a witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to the Lord because of oppressors , and He will send them a Savior and a Champion , and He will deliver them .
23:19:021:0	Thus the Lord will make Himself known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know the Lord in that day . They will even worship with sacrifice and offering , and will make a vow to the Lord and perform it .
23:19:022:0	The Lord will strike Egypt , striking but healing ; so they will return to the Lord , and He will respond to them and will heal them .
23:19:023:0	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria , and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians .
23:19:024:0	In that day Israel will be the third party with Egypt and Assyria , a blessing in the midst of the earth ,
23:19:025:0	whom the Lord of hosts has blessed , saying , “ Blessed is Egypt My people , and Assyria the work of My hands , and Israel My inheritance . ”
