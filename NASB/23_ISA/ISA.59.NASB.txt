23:59:001:1	Separation from God
23:59:001:0	Behold , the Lord’s hand is not so shortThat it cannot save ; Nor is His ear so dullThat it cannot hear .
23:59:002:0	But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God , And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear .
23:59:003:0	For your hands are defiled with bloodAnd your fingers with iniquity ; Your lips have spoken falsehood , Your tongue mutters wickedness .
23:59:004:0	No one sues righteously and no one pleads honestly . They trust in confusion and speak lies ; They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity .
23:59:005:0	They hatch adders’ eggs and weave the spider’s web ; He who eats of their eggs dies , And from that which is crushed a snake breaks forth .
23:59:006:0	Their webs will not become clothing , Nor will they cover themselves with their works ; Their works are works of iniquity , And an act of violence is in their hands .
23:59:007:0	Their feet run to evil , And they hasten to shed innocent blood ; Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity , Devastation and destruction are in their highways .
23:59:002:1	A Confession of Wickedness
23:59:008:0	They do not know the way of peace , And there is no justice in their tracks ; They have made their paths crooked , Whoever treads on them does not know peace .
23:59:009:0	Therefore justice is far from us , And righteousness does not overtake us ; We hope for light , but behold , darkness , For brightness , but we walk in gloom .
23:59:010:0	We grope along the wall like blind men , We grope like those who have no eyes ; We stumble at midday as in the twilight , Among those who are vigorous we are like dead men .
23:59:011:0	All of us growl like bears , And moan sadly like doves ; We hope for justice , but there is none , For salvation , but it is far from us .
23:59:012:0	For our transgressions are multiplied before You , And our sins testify against us ; For our transgressions are with us , And we know our iniquities :
23:59:013:0	Transgressing and denying the Lord , And turning away from our God , Speaking oppression and revolt , Conceiving in and uttering from the heart lying words .
23:59:014:0	Justice is turned back , And righteousness stands far away ; For truth has stumbled in the street , And uprightness cannot enter .
23:59:015:0	Yes , truth is lacking ; And he who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey . Now the Lord saw , And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice .
23:59:016:0	And He saw that there was no man , And was astonished that there was no one to intercede ; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him , And His righteousness upheld Him .
23:59:017:0	He put on righteousness like a breastplate , And a helmet of salvation on His head ; And He put on garments of vengeance for clothingAnd wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle .
23:59:018:0	According to their deeds , so He will repay , Wrath to His adversaries , recompense to His enemies ; To the coastlands He will make recompense .
23:59:019:0	So they will fear the name of the Lord from the westAnd His glory from the rising of the sun , For He will come like a rushing streamWhich the wind of the Lord drives .
23:59:020:0	“ A Redeemer will come to Zion , And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob , ” declares the Lord .
23:59:021:0	“ As for Me , this is My covenant with them , ” says the Lord : “ My Spirit which is upon you , and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth , nor from the mouth of your offspring , nor from the mouth of your offspring’s offspring , ” says the Lord , “ from now and forever . ”
