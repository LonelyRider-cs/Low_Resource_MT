23:46:001:1	Babylon’s Idols and the True God
23:46:001:0	Bel has bowed down , Nebo stoops over ; Their images are consigned to the beasts and the cattle . The things that you carry are burdensome , A load for the weary beast .
23:46:002:0	They stooped over , they have bowed down together ; They could not rescue the burden , But have themselves gone into captivity .
23:46:003:0	“ Listen to Me , O house of Jacob , And all the remnant of the house of Israel , You who have been borne by Me from birthAnd have been carried from the womb ;
23:46:004:0	Even to your old age I will be the same , And even to your graying years I will bear you ! I have done it , and I will carry you ; And I will bear you and I will deliver you .
23:46:005:0	“ To whom would you liken MeAnd make Me equal and compare Me , That we would be alike ?
23:46:006:0	Those who lavish gold from the purseAnd weigh silver on the scaleHire a goldsmith , and he makes it into a god ; They bow down , indeed they worship it .
23:46:007:0	They lift it upon the shoulder and carry it ; They set it in its place and it stands there . It does not move from its place . Though one may cry to it , it cannot answer ; It cannot deliver him from his distress .
23:46:008:0	“ Remember this , and be assured ; Recall it to mind , you transgressors .
23:46:009:0	Remember the former things long past , For I am God , and there is no other ; I am God , and there is no one like Me ,
23:46:010:0	Declaring the end from the beginning , And from ancient times things which have not been done , Saying , ‘My purpose will be established , And I will accomplish all My good pleasure’ ;
23:46:011:0	Calling a bird of prey from the east , The man of My purpose from a far country . Truly I have spoken ; truly I will bring it to pass . I have planned it , surely I will do it .
23:46:012:0	“ Listen to Me , you stubborn-minded , Who are far from righteousness .
23:46:013:0	I bring near My righteousness , it is not far off ; And My salvation will not delay . And I will grant salvation in Zion , And My glory for Israel .
