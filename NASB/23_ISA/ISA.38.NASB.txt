23:38:001:1	Hezekiah Healed
23:38:001:0	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill . And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘Set your house in order , for you shall die and not live . ’ ”
23:38:002:0	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord ,
23:38:003:0	and said , “ Remember now , O Lord , I beseech You , how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart , and have done what is good in Your sight . ” And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
23:38:004:0	Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah , saying ,
23:38:005:0	“ Go and say to Hezekiah , ‘Thus says the Lord , the God of your father David , “ I have heard your prayer , I have seen your tears ; behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
23:38:006:0	I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city . ” ’
23:38:007:0	“ This shall be the sign to you from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing that He has spoken :
23:38:008:0	Behold , I will cause the shadow on the stairway , which has gone down with the sun on the stairway of Ahaz , to go back ten steps . ” So the sun’s shadow went back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down .
23:38:009:0	A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery :
23:38:010:0	I said , “ In the middle of my lifeI am to enter the gates of Sheol ; I am to be deprived of the rest of my years . ”
23:38:011:0	I said , “ I will not see the Lord , The Lord in the land of the living ; I will look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world .
23:38:012:0	Like a shepherd’s tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me ; As a weaver I rolled up my life . He cuts me off from the loom ; From day until night You make an end of me .
23:38:013:0	I composed my soul until morning . Like a lion—so He breaks all my bones , From day until night You make an end of me .
23:38:014:0	Like a swallow , like a crane , so I twitter ; I moan like a dove ; My eyes look wistfully to the heights ; O Lord , I am oppressed , be my security .
23:38:015:0	“ What shall I say ? For He has spoken to me , and He Himself has done it ; I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul .
23:38:016:0	O Lord , by these things men live , And in all these is the life of my spirit ; O restore me to health and let me live !
23:38:017:0	Lo , for my own welfare I had great bitterness ; It is You who has kept my soul from the pit of nothingness , For You have cast all my sins behind Your back .
23:38:018:0	For Sheol cannot thank You , Death cannot praise You ; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness .
23:38:019:0	It is the living who give thanks to You , as I do today ; A father tells his sons about Your faithfulness .
23:38:020:0	The Lord will surely save me ; So we will play my songs on stringed instrumentsAll the days of our life at the house of the Lord . ”
23:38:021:0	Now Isaiah had said , “ Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil , that he may recover . ”
23:38:022:0	Then Hezekiah had said , “ What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord ? ”
