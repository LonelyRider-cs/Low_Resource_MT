23:62:001:1	Zion’s Glory and New Name
23:62:001:0	For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent , And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep quiet , Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness , And her salvation like a torch that is burning .
23:62:002:0	The nations will see your righteousness , And all kings your glory ; And you will be called by a new nameWhich the mouth of the Lord will designate .
23:62:003:0	You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord , And a royal diadem in the hand of your God .
23:62:004:0	It will no longer be said to you , “ Forsaken , ” Nor to your land will it any longer be said , “ Desolate ” ; But you will be called , “ My delight is in her , ” And your land , “ Married ” ; For the Lord delights in you , And to Him your land will be married .
23:62:005:0	For as a young man marries a virgin , So your sons will marry you ; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride , So your God will rejoice over you .
23:62:006:0	On your walls , O Jerusalem , I have appointed watchmen ; All day and all night they will never keep silent . You who remind the Lord , take no rest for yourselves ;
23:62:007:0	And give Him no rest until He establishesAnd makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth .
23:62:008:0	The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm , “ I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies ; Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored . ”
23:62:009:0	But those who garner it will eat it and praise the Lord ; And those who gather it will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary .
23:62:010:0	Go through , go through the gates , Clear the way for the people ; Build up , build up the highway , Remove the stones , lift up a standard over the peoples .
23:62:011:0	Behold , the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth , Say to the daughter of Zion , “ Lo , your salvation comes ; Behold His reward is with Him , and His recompense before Him . ”
23:62:012:0	And they will call them , “ The holy people , The redeemed of the Lord ” ; And you will be called , “ Sought out , a city not forsaken . ”
