23:53:001:1	The Suffering Servant
23:53:001:0	Who has believed our message ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
23:53:002:0	For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot , And like a root out of parched ground ; He has no stately form or majestyThat we should look upon Him , Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him .
23:53:003:0	He was despised and forsaken of men , A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief ; And like one from whom men hide their faceHe was despised , and we did not esteem Him .
23:53:004:0	Surely our griefs He Himself bore , And our sorrows He carried ; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken , Smitten of God , and afflicted .
23:53:005:0	But He was pierced through for our transgressions , He was crushed for our iniquities ; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him , And by His scourging we are healed .
23:53:006:0	All of us like sheep have gone astray , Each of us has turned to his own way ; But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us allTo fall on Him .
23:53:007:0	He was oppressed and He was afflicted , Yet He did not open His mouth ; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter , And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers , So He did not open His mouth .
23:53:008:0	By oppression and judgment He was taken away ; And as for His generation , who consideredThat He was cut off out of the land of the livingFor the transgression of my people , to whom the stroke was due ?
23:53:009:0	His grave was assigned with wicked men , Yet He was with a rich man in His death , Because He had done no violence , Nor was there any deceit in His mouth .
23:53:010:0	But the Lord was pleasedTo crush Him , putting Him to grief ; If He would render Himself as a guilt offering , He will see His offspring , He will prolong His days , And the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in His hand .
23:53:011:0	As a result of the anguish of His soul , He will see it and be satisfied ; By His knowledge the Righteous One , My Servant , will justify the many , As He will bear their iniquities .
23:53:012:0	Therefore , I will allot Him a portion with the great , And He will divide the booty with the strong ; Because He poured out Himself to death , And was numbered with the transgressors ; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many , And interceded for the transgressors .
