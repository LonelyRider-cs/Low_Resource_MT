23:21:001:1	God Commands That Babylon Be Taken
23:21:001:0	The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea . As windstorms in the Negev sweep on , It comes from the wilderness , from a terrifying land .
23:21:002:0	A harsh vision has been shown to me ; The treacherous one still deals treacherously , and the destroyer still destroys . Go up , Elam , lay siege , Media ; I have made an end of all the groaning she has caused .
23:21:003:0	For this reason my loins are full of anguish ; Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor . I am so bewildered I cannot hear , so terrified I cannot see .
23:21:004:0	My mind reels , horror overwhelms me ; The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling .
23:21:005:0	They set the table , they spread out the cloth , they eat , they drink ; “ Rise up , captains , oil the shields , ”
23:21:006:0	For thus the Lord says to me , “ Go , station the lookout , let him report what he sees .
23:21:007:0	When he sees riders , horsemen in pairs , A train of donkeys , a train of camels , Let him pay close attention , very close attention . ”
23:21:008:0	Then the lookout called , “ O Lord , I stand continually by day on the watchtower , And I am stationed every night at my guard post .
23:21:009:0	Now behold , here comes a troop of riders , horsemen in pairs . ” And one said , “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon ; And all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground . ”
23:21:002:1	Oracles about Edom and Arabia
23:21:010:0	O my threshed people , and my afflicted of the threshing floor ! What I have heard from the Lord of hosts , The God of Israel , I make known to you .
23:21:011:0	The oracle concerning Edom . One keeps calling to me from Seir , “ Watchman , how far gone is the night ? Watchman , how far gone is the night ? ”
23:21:012:0	The watchman says , “ Morning comes but also night . If you would inquire , inquire ; Come back again . ”
23:21:013:0	The oracle about Arabia . In the thickets of Arabia you must spend the night , O caravans of Dedanites .
23:21:014:0	Bring water for the thirsty , O inhabitants of the land of Tema , Meet the fugitive with bread .
23:21:015:0	For they have fled from the swords , From the drawn sword , and from the bent bowAnd from the press of battle .
23:21:016:0	For thus the Lord said to me , “ In a year , as a hired man would count it , all the splendor of Kedar will terminate ;
23:21:017:0	and the remainder of the number of bowmen , the mighty men of the sons of Kedar , will be few ; for the Lord God of Israel has spoken . ”
