23:60:001:1	A Glorified Zion
23:60:001:0	“ Arise , shine ; for your light has come , And the glory of the Lord has risen upon you .
23:60:002:0	For behold , darkness will cover the earthAnd deep darkness the peoples ; But the Lord will rise upon youAnd His glory will appear upon you .
23:60:003:0	Nations will come to your light , And kings to the brightness of your rising .
23:60:004:0	“ Lift up your eyes round about and see ; They all gather together , they come to you . Your sons will come from afar , And your daughters will be carried in the arms .
23:60:005:0	Then you will see and be radiant , And your heart will thrill and rejoice ; Because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you , The wealth of the nations will come to you .
23:60:006:0	A multitude of camels will cover you , The young camels of Midian and Ephah ; All those from Sheba will come ; They will bring gold and frankincense , And will bear good news of the praises of the Lord .
23:60:007:0	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you , The rams of Nebaioth will minister to you ; They will go up with acceptance on My altar , And I shall glorify My glorious house .
23:60:008:0	Who are these who fly like a cloudAnd like the doves to their lattices ?
23:60:009:0	Surely the coastlands will wait for Me ; And the ships of Tarshish will come first , To bring your sons from afar , Their silver and their gold with them , For the name of the Lord your God , And for the Holy One of Israel because He has glorified you .
23:60:010:0	“ Foreigners will build up your walls , And their kings will minister to you ; For in My wrath I struck you , And in My favor I have had compassion on you .
23:60:011:0	Your gates will be open continually ; They will not be closed day or night , So that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations , With their kings led in procession .
23:60:012:0	For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish , And the nations will be utterly ruined .
23:60:013:0	The glory of Lebanon will come to you , The juniper , the box tree and the cypress together , To beautify the place of My sanctuary ; And I shall make the place of My feet glorious .
23:60:014:0	The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you , And all those who despised you will bow themselves at the soles of your feet ; And they will call you the city of the Lord , The Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
23:60:015:0	“ Whereas you have been forsaken and hatedWith no one passing through , I will make you an everlasting pride , A joy from generation to generation .
23:60:016:0	You will also suck the milk of nationsAnd suck the breast of kings ; Then you will know that I , the Lord , am your SaviorAnd your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .
23:60:017:0	Instead of bronze I will bring gold , And instead of iron I will bring silver , And instead of wood , bronze , And instead of stones , iron . And I will make peace your administratorsAnd righteousness your overseers .
23:60:018:0	Violence will not be heard again in your land , Nor devastation or destruction within your borders ; But you will call your walls salvation , and your gates praise .
23:60:019:0	No longer will you have the sun for light by day , Nor for brightness will the moon give you light ; But you will have the Lord for an everlasting light , And your God for your glory .
23:60:020:0	Your sun will no longer set , Nor will your moon wane ; For you will have the Lord for an everlasting light , And the days of your mourning will be over .
23:60:021:0	Then all your people will be righteous ; They will possess the land forever , The branch of My planting , The work of My hands , That I may be glorified .
23:60:022:0	The smallest one will become a clan , And the least one a mighty nation . I , the Lord , will hasten it in its time . ”
