23:63:001:1	God’s Vengeance on the Nations
23:63:001:0	Who is this who comes from Edom , With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah , This One who is majestic in His apparel , Marching in the greatness of His strength ? “ It is I who speak in righteousness , mighty to save . ”
23:63:002:0	Why is Your apparel red , And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press ?
23:63:003:0	“ I have trodden the wine trough alone , And from the peoples there was no man with Me . I also trod them in My angerAnd trampled them in My wrath ; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments , And I stained all My raiment .
23:63:004:0	For the day of vengeance was in My heart , And My year of redemption has come .
23:63:005:0	I looked , and there was no one to help , And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold ; So My own arm brought salvation to Me , And My wrath upheld Me .
23:63:002:1	God’s Ancient Mercies Recalled
23:63:006:0	I trod down the peoples in My angerAnd made them drunk in My wrath , And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth . ”
23:63:007:0	I shall make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the Lord , the praises of the Lord , According to all that the Lord has granted us , And the great goodness toward the house of Israel , Which He has granted them according to His compassionAnd according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses .
23:63:008:0	For He said , “ Surely , they are My people , Sons who will not deal falsely . ” So He became their Savior .
23:63:009:0	In all their affliction He was afflicted , And the angel of His presence saved them ; In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them , And He lifted them and carried them all the days of old .
23:63:010:0	But they rebelledAnd grieved His Holy Spirit ; Therefore He turned Himself to become their enemy , He fought against them .
23:63:011:0	Then His people remembered the days of old , of Moses . Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock ? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them ,
23:63:012:0	Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses , Who divided the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name ,
23:63:013:0	Who led them through the depths ? Like the horse in the wilderness , they did not stumble ;
23:63:003:1	“ You Are Our Father ”
23:63:014:0	As the cattle which go down into the valley , The Spirit of the Lord gave them rest . So You led Your people , To make for Yourself a glorious name .
23:63:015:0	Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious habitation ; Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds ? The stirrings of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained toward me .
23:63:016:0	For You are our Father , though Abraham does not know usAnd Israel does not recognize us . You , O Lord , are our Father , Our Redeemer from of old is Your name .
23:63:017:0	Why , O Lord , do You cause us to stray from Your waysAnd harden our heart from fearing You ? Return for the sake of Your servants , the tribes of Your heritage .
23:63:018:0	Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while , Our adversaries have trodden it down .
23:63:019:0	We have become like those over whom You have never ruled , Like those who were not called by Your name .
