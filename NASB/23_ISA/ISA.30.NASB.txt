23:30:001:1	Judah Warned against Egyptian Alliance
23:30:001:0	“ Woe to the rebellious children , ” declares the Lord , “ Who execute a plan , but not Mine , And make an alliance , but not of My Spirit , In order to add sin to sin ;
23:30:002:0	Who proceed down to EgyptWithout consulting Me , To take refuge in the safety of PharaohAnd to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt !
23:30:003:0	Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shameAnd the shelter in the shadow of Egypt , your humiliation .
23:30:004:0	For their princes are at ZoanAnd their ambassadors arrive at Hanes .
23:30:005:0	Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them , Who are not for help or profit , but for shame and also for reproach . ”
23:30:006:0	The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev . Through a land of distress and anguish , From where come lioness and lion , viper and flying serpent , They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeysAnd their treasures on camels’ humps , To a people who cannot profit them ;
23:30:007:0	Even Egypt , whose help is vain and empty . Therefore , I have called her “ Rahab who has been exterminated . ”
23:30:008:0	Now go , write it on a tablet before themAnd inscribe it on a scroll , That it may serve in the time to comeAs a witness forever .
23:30:009:0	For this is a rebellious people , false sons , Sons who refuse to listenTo the instruction of the Lord ;
23:30:010:0	Who say to the seers , “ You must not see visions ” ; And to the prophets , “ You must not prophesy to us what is right , Speak to us pleasant words , Prophesy illusions .
23:30:011:0	Get out of the way , turn aside from the path , Let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel . ”
23:30:012:0	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel , “ Since you have rejected this wordAnd have put your trust in oppression and guile , and have relied on them ,
23:30:013:0	Therefore this iniquity will be to youLike a breach about to fall , A bulge in a high wall , Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant ,
23:30:014:0	Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter’s jar , So ruthlessly shatteredThat a sherd will not be found among its piecesTo take fire from a hearthOr to scoop water from a cistern . ”
23:30:015:0	For thus the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel , has said , “ In repentance and rest you will be saved , In quietness and trust is your strength . ” But you were not willing ,
23:30:016:0	And you said , “ No , for we will flee on horses , ” Therefore you shall flee ! “ And we will ride on swift horses , ” Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift .
23:30:002:1	God Is Gracious and Just
23:30:017:0	One thousand will flee at the threat of one man ; You will flee at the threat of five , Until you are left as a flag on a mountain topAnd as a signal on a hill .
23:30:018:0	Therefore the Lord longs to be gracious to you , And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you . For the Lord is a God of justice ; How blessed are all those who long for Him .
23:30:019:0	O people in Zion , inhabitant in Jerusalem , you will weep no longer . He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry ; when He hears it , He will answer you .
23:30:020:0	Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression , He , your Teacher will no longer hide Himself , but your eyes will behold your Teacher .
23:30:021:0	Your ears will hear a word behind you , “ This is the way , walk in it , ” whenever you turn to the right or to the left .
23:30:022:0	And you will defile your graven images overlaid with silver , and your molten images plated with gold . You will scatter them as an impure thing , and say to them , “ Be gone ! ”
23:30:023:0	Then He will give you rain for the seed which you will sow in the ground , and bread from the yield of the ground , and it will be rich and plenteous ; on that day your livestock will graze in a roomy pasture .
23:30:024:0	Also the oxen and the donkeys which work the ground will eat salted fodder , which has been winnowed with shovel and fork .
23:30:025:0	On every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
23:30:026:0	The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter , like the light of seven days , on the day the Lord binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted .
23:30:027:0	Behold , the name of the Lord comes from a remote place ; Burning is His anger and dense is His smoke ; His lips are filled with indignationAnd His tongue is like a consuming fire ;
23:30:028:0	His breath is like an overflowing torrent , Which reaches to the neck , To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve , And to put in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads to ruin .
23:30:029:0	You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival , And gladness of heart as when one marches to the sound of the flute , To go to the mountain of the Lord , to the Rock of Israel .
23:30:030:0	And the Lord will cause His voice of authority to be heard , And the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger , And in the flame of a consuming fireIn cloudburst , downpour and hailstones .
23:30:031:0	For at the voice of the Lord Assyria will be terrified , When He strikes with the rod .
23:30:032:0	And every blow of the rod of punishment , Which the Lord will lay on him , Will be with the music of tambourines and lyres ; And in battles , brandishing weapons , He will fight them .
23:30:033:0	For Topheth has long been ready , Indeed , it has been prepared for the king . He has made it deep and large , A pyre of fire with plenty of wood ; The breath of the Lord , like a torrent of brimstone , sets it afire .
