23:45:001:1	God Uses Cyrus
23:45:001:0	Thus says the Lord to Cyrus His anointed , Whom I have taken by the right hand , To subdue nations before himAnd to loose the loins of kings ; To open doors before him so that gates will not be shut :
23:45:002:0	“ I will go before you and make the rough places smooth ; I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars .
23:45:003:0	I will give you the treasures of darknessAnd hidden wealth of secret places , So that you may know that it is I , The Lord , the God of Israel , who calls you by your name .
23:45:004:0	For the sake of Jacob My servant , And Israel My chosen one , I have also called you by your name ; I have given you a title of honorThough you have not known Me .
23:45:005:0	I am the Lord , and there is no other ; Besides Me there is no God . I will gird you , though you have not known Me ;
23:45:006:0	That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sunThat there is no one besides Me . I am the Lord , and there is no other ,
23:45:002:1	God’s Supreme Power
23:45:007:0	The One forming light and creating darkness , Causing well-being and creating calamity ; I am the Lord who does all these .
23:45:008:0	“ Drip down , O heavens , from above , And let the clouds pour down righteousness ; Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit , And righteousness spring up with it . I , the Lord , have created it .
23:45:009:0	“ Woe to the one who quarrels with his Maker—An earthenware vessel among the vessels of earth ! Will the clay say to the potter , ‘What are you doing ? ’Or the thing you are making say , ‘He has no hands’ ?
23:45:010:0	Woe to him who says to a father , ‘What are you begetting ? ’Or to a woman , ‘To what are you giving birth ? ’ ”
23:45:011:0	Thus says the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker : “ Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons , And you shall commit to Me the work of My hands .
23:45:012:0	It is I who made the earth , and created man upon it . I stretched out the heavens with My handsAnd I ordained all their host .
23:45:013:0	I have aroused him in righteousnessAnd I will make all his ways smooth ; He will build My city and will let My exiles go free , Without any payment or reward , ” says the Lord of hosts .
23:45:014:0	Thus says the Lord , “ The products of Egypt and the merchandise of CushAnd the Sabeans , men of stature , Will come over to you and will be yours ; They will walk behind you , they will come over in chainsAnd will bow down to you ; They will make supplication to you : ‘Surely , God is with you , and there is none else , No other God . ’ ”
23:45:015:0	Truly , You are a God who hides Himself , O God of Israel , Savior !
23:45:016:0	They will be put to shame and even humiliated , all of them ; The manufacturers of idols will go away together in humiliation .
23:45:017:0	Israel has been saved by the LordWith an everlasting salvation ; You will not be put to shame or humiliatedTo all eternity .
23:45:018:0	For thus says the Lord , who created the heavens ( He is the God who formed the earth and made it , He established it and did not create it a waste place , but formed it to be inhabited ) , “ I am the Lord , and there is none else .
23:45:019:0	I have not spoken in secret , In some dark land ; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob , ‘Seek Me in a waste place’ ; I , the Lord , speak righteousness , Declaring things that are upright .
23:45:020:0	“ Gather yourselves and come ; Draw near together , you fugitives of the nations ; They have no knowledge , Who carry about their wooden idolAnd pray to a god who cannot save .
23:45:021:0	Declare and set forth your case ; Indeed , let them consult together . Who has announced this from of old ? Who has long since declared it ? Is it not I , the Lord ? And there is no other God besides Me , A righteous God and a Savior ; There is none except Me .
23:45:022:0	Turn to Me and be saved , all the ends of the earth ; For I am God , and there is no other .
23:45:023:0	I have sworn by Myself , The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousnessAnd will not turn back , That to Me every knee will bow , every tongue will swear allegiance .
23:45:024:0	They will say of Me , ‘Only in the Lord are righteousness and strength . ’Men will come to Him , And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame .
23:45:025:0	In the Lord all the offspring of IsraelWill be justified and will glory . ”
