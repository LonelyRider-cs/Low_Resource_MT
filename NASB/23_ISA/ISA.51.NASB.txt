23:51:001:1	Israel Exhorted
23:51:001:0	“ Listen to me , you who pursue righteousness , Who seek the Lord : Look to the rock from which you were hewnAnd to the quarry from which you were dug .
23:51:002:0	Look to Abraham your fatherAnd to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain ; When he was but one I called him , Then I blessed him and multiplied him . ”
23:51:003:0	Indeed , the Lord will comfort Zion ; He will comfort all her waste places . And her wilderness He will make like Eden , And her desert like the garden of the Lord ; Joy and gladness will be found in her , Thanksgiving and sound of a melody .
23:51:004:0	“ Pay attention to Me , O My people , And give ear to Me , O My nation ; For a law will go forth from Me , And I will set My justice for a light of the peoples .
23:51:005:0	My righteousness is near , My salvation has gone forth , And My arms will judge the peoples ; The coastlands will wait for Me , And for My arm they will wait expectantly .
23:51:006:0	Lift up your eyes to the sky , Then look to the earth beneath ; For the sky will vanish like smoke , And the earth will wear out like a garmentAnd its inhabitants will die in like manner ; But My salvation will be forever , And My righteousness will not wane .
23:51:007:0	Listen to Me , you who know righteousness , A people in whose heart is My law ; Do not fear the reproach of man , Nor be dismayed at their revilings .
23:51:008:0	For the moth will eat them like a garment , And the grub will eat them like wool . But My righteousness will be forever , And My salvation to all generations . ”
23:51:009:0	Awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the Lord ; Awake as in the days of old , the generations of long ago . Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces , Who pierced the dragon ?
23:51:010:0	Was it not You who dried up the sea , The waters of the great deep ; Who made the depths of the sea a pathwayFor the redeemed to cross over ?
23:51:011:0	So the ransomed of the Lord will returnAnd come with joyful shouting to Zion , And everlasting joy will be on their heads . They will obtain gladness and joy , And sorrow and sighing will flee away .
23:51:012:0	“ I , even I , am He who comforts you . Who are you that you are afraid of man who diesAnd of the son of man who is made like grass ,
23:51:013:0	That you have forgotten the Lord your Maker , Who stretched out the heavensAnd laid the foundations of the earth , That you fear continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor , As he makes ready to destroy ? But where is the fury of the oppressor ?
23:51:014:0	The exile will soon be set free , and will not die in the dungeon , nor will his bread be lacking .
23:51:015:0	For I am the Lord your God , who stirs up the sea and its waves roar ( the Lord of hosts is His name ) .
23:51:016:0	I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand , to establish the heavens , to found the earth , and to say to Zion , ‘You are My people . ’ ”
23:51:017:0	Rouse yourself ! Rouse yourself ! Arise , O Jerusalem , You who have drunk from the Lord’s hand the cup of His anger ; The chalice of reeling you have drained to the dregs .
23:51:018:0	There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne , Nor is there one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has reared .
23:51:019:0	These two things have befallen you ; Who will mourn for you ? The devastation and destruction , famine and sword ; How shall I comfort you ?
23:51:020:0	Your sons have fainted , They lie helpless at the head of every street , Like an antelope in a net , Full of the wrath of the Lord , The rebuke of your God .
23:51:021:0	Therefore , please hear this , you afflicted , Who are drunk , but not with wine :
23:51:022:0	Thus says your Lord , the Lord , even your GodWho contends for His people , “ Behold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of reeling , The chalice of My anger ; You will never drink it again .
23:51:023:0	I will put it into the hand of your tormentors , Who have said to you , ‘Lie down that we may walk over you . ’You have even made your back like the groundAnd like the street for those who walk over it . ”
