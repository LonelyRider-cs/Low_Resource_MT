23:9:001:1	Birth and Reign of the Prince of Peace
23:9:001:0	But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish ; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt , but later on He shall make it glorious , by the way of the sea , on the other side of Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles .
23:9:002:0	The people who walk in darknessWill see a great light ; Those who live in a dark land , The light will shine on them .
23:9:003:0	You shall multiply the nation , You shall increase their gladness ; They will be glad in Your presenceAs with the gladness of harvest , As men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
23:9:004:0	For You shall break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders , The rod of their oppressor , as at the battle of Midian .
23:9:005:0	For every boot of the booted warrior in the battle tumult , And cloak rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
23:9:006:0	For a child will be born to us , a son will be given to us ; And the government will rest on His shoulders ; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor , Mighty God , Eternal Father , Prince of Peace .
23:9:002:1	God’s Anger with Israel’s Arrogance
23:9:007:0	There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace , On the throne of David and over his kingdom , To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousnessFrom then on and forevermore . The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this .
23:9:008:0	The Lord sends a message against Jacob , And it falls on Israel .
23:9:009:0	And all the people know it , That is , Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria , Asserting in pride and in arrogance of heart :
23:9:010:0	“ The bricks have fallen down , But we will rebuild with smooth stones ; The sycamores have been cut down , But we will replace them with cedars . ”
23:9:011:0	Therefore the Lord raises against them adversaries from RezinAnd spurs their enemies on ,
23:9:012:0	The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west ; And they devour Israel with gaping jaws . In spite of all this , His anger does not turn awayAnd His hand is still stretched out .
23:9:013:0	Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them , Nor do they seek the Lord of hosts .
23:9:014:0	So the Lord cuts off head and tail from Israel , Both palm branch and bulrush in a single day .
23:9:015:0	The head is the elder and honorable man , And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail .
23:9:016:0	For those who guide this people are leading them astray ; And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion .
23:9:017:0	Therefore the Lord does not take pleasure in their young men , Nor does He have pity on their orphans or their widows ; For every one of them is godless and an evildoer , And every mouth is speaking foolishness . In spite of all this , His anger does not turn awayAnd His hand is still stretched out .
23:9:018:0	For wickedness burns like a fire ; It consumes briars and thorns ; It even sets the thickets of the forest aflameAnd they roll upward in a column of smoke .
23:9:019:0	By the fury of the Lord of hosts the land is burned up , And the people are like fuel for the fire ; No man spares his brother .
23:9:020:0	They slice off what is on the right hand but still are hungry , And they eat what is on the left hand but they are not satisfied ; Each of them eats the flesh of his own arm .
23:9:021:0	Manasseh devours Ephraim , and Ephraim Manasseh , And together they are against Judah . In spite of all this , His anger does not turn awayAnd His hand is still stretched out .
