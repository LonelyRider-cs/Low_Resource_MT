23:66:001:1	Heaven Is God’s Throne
23:66:001:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool . Where then is a house you could build for Me ? And where is a place that I may rest ?
23:66:002:1	Hypocrisy Rebuked
23:66:002:0	For My hand made all these things , Thus all these things came into being , ” declares the Lord . “ But to this one I will look , To him who is humble and contrite of spirit , and who trembles at My word .
23:66:003:0	“ But he who kills an ox is like one who slays a man ; He who sacrifices a lamb is like the one who breaks a dog’s neck ; He who offers a grain offering is like one who offers swine’s blood ; He who burns incense is like the one who blesses an idol . As they have chosen their own ways , And their soul delights in their abominations ,
23:66:004:0	So I will choose their punishmentsAnd will bring on them what they dread . Because I called , but no one answered ; I spoke , but they did not listen . And they did evil in My sightAnd chose that in which I did not delight . ”
23:66:005:0	Hear the word of the Lord , you who tremble at His word : “ Your brothers who hate you , who exclude you for My name’s sake , Have said , ‘Let the Lord be glorified , that we may see your joy . ’But they will be put to shame .
23:66:006:0	A voice of uproar from the city , a voice from the temple , The voice of the Lord who is rendering recompense to His enemies .
23:66:007:0	“ Before she travailed , she brought forth ; Before her pain came , she gave birth to a boy .
23:66:008:0	Who has heard such a thing ? Who has seen such things ? Can a land be born in one day ? Can a nation be brought forth all at once ? As soon as Zion travailed , she also brought forth her sons .
23:66:003:1	Joy in Jerusalem’s Future
23:66:009:0	Shall I bring to the point of birth and not give delivery ? ” says the Lord . “ Or shall I who gives delivery shut the womb ? ” says your God .
23:66:010:0	“ Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her , all you who love her ; Be exceedingly glad with her , all you who mourn over her ,
23:66:011:0	That you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts , That you may suck and be delighted with her bountiful bosom . ”
23:66:012:0	For thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I extend peace to her like a river , And the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream ; And you will be nursed , you will be carried on the hip and fondled on the knees .
23:66:013:0	As one whom his mother comforts , so I will comfort you ; And you will be comforted in Jerusalem . ”
23:66:014:0	Then you will see this , and your heart will be glad , And your bones will flourish like the new grass ; And the hand of the Lord will be made known to His servants , But He will be indignant toward His enemies .
23:66:015:0	For behold , the Lord will come in fireAnd His chariots like the whirlwind , To render His anger with fury , And His rebuke with flames of fire .
23:66:016:0	For the Lord will execute judgment by fireAnd by His sword on all flesh , And those slain by the Lord will be many .
23:66:017:0	“ Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go to the gardens , Following one in the center , Who eat swine’s flesh , detestable things and mice , Will come to an end altogether , ” declares the Lord .
23:66:018:0	“ For I know their works and their thoughts ; the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues . And they shall come and see My glory .
23:66:019:0	I will set a sign among them and will send survivors from them to the nations : Tarshish , Put , Lud , Meshech , Tubal and Javan , to the distant coastlands that have neither heard My fame nor seen My glory . And they will declare My glory among the nations .
23:66:020:0	Then they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as a grain offering to the Lord , on horses , in chariots , in litters , on mules and on camels , to My holy mountain Jerusalem , ” says the Lord , “ just as the sons of Israel bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord .
23:66:021:0	I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites , ” says the Lord .
23:66:022:0	“ For just as the new heavens and the new earthWhich I make will endure before Me , ” declares the Lord , “ So your offspring and your name will endure .
23:66:023:0	And it shall be from new moon to new moonAnd from sabbath to sabbath , All mankind will come to bow down before Me , ” says the Lord .
23:66:024:0	“ Then they will go forth and lookOn the corpses of the menWho have transgressed against Me . For their worm will not dieAnd their fire will not be quenched ; And they will be an abhorrence to all mankind . ”
