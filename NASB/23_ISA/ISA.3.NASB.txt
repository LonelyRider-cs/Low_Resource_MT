23:3:001:1	God Will Remove the Leaders
23:3:001:0	For behold , the Lord God of hosts is going to remove from Jerusalem and JudahBoth supply and support , the whole supply of breadAnd the whole supply of water ;
23:3:002:0	The mighty man and the warrior , The judge and the prophet , The diviner and the elder ,
23:3:003:0	The captain of fifty and the honorable man , The counselor and the expert artisan , And the skillful enchanter .
23:3:004:0	And I will make mere lads their princes , And capricious children will rule over them ,
23:3:005:0	And the people will be oppressed , Each one by another , and each one by his neighbor ; The youth will storm against the elderAnd the inferior against the honorable .
23:3:006:0	When a man lays hold of his brother in his father’s house , saying , “ You have a cloak , you shall be our ruler , And these ruins will be under your charge , ”
23:3:007:0	He will protest on that day , saying , “ I will not be your healer , For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak ; You should not appoint me ruler of the people . ”
23:3:008:0	For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen , Because their speech and their actions are against the Lord , To rebel against His glorious presence .
23:3:009:0	The expression of their faces bears witness against them , And they display their sin like Sodom ; They do not even conceal it . Woe to them ! For they have brought evil on themselves .
23:3:010:0	Say to the righteous that it will go well with them , For they will eat the fruit of their actions .
23:3:011:0	Woe to the wicked ! It will go badly with him , For what he deserves will be done to him .
23:3:002:1	God Will Judge
23:3:012:0	O My people ! Their oppressors are children , And women rule over them . O My people ! Those who guide you lead you astrayAnd confuse the direction of your paths .
23:3:013:0	The Lord arises to contend , And stands to judge the people .
23:3:014:0	The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and princes of His people , “ It is you who have devoured the vineyard ; The plunder of the poor is in your houses .
23:3:003:1	Judah’s Women Denounced
23:3:015:0	What do you mean by crushing My peopleAnd grinding the face of the poor ? ” Declares the Lord God of hosts .
23:3:016:0	Moreover , the Lord said , “ Because the daughters of Zion are proudAnd walk with heads held high and seductive eyes , And go along with mincing stepsAnd tinkle the bangles on their feet ,
23:3:017:0	Therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs , And the Lord will make their foreheads bare . ”
23:3:018:0	In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets , headbands , crescent ornaments ,
23:3:019:0	dangling earrings , bracelets , veils ,
23:3:020:0	headdresses , ankle chains , sashes , perfume boxes , amulets ,
23:3:021:0	finger rings , nose rings ,
23:3:022:0	festal robes , outer tunics , cloaks , money purses ,
23:3:023:0	hand mirrors , undergarments , turbans and veils .
23:3:024:0	Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there will be putrefaction ; Instead of a belt , a rope ; Instead of well-set hair , a plucked-out scalp ; Instead of fine clothes , a donning of sackcloth ; And branding instead of beauty .
23:3:025:0	Your men will fall by the swordAnd your mighty ones in battle .
23:3:026:0	And her gates will lament and mourn , And deserted she will sit on the ground .
