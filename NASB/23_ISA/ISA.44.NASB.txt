23:44:001:1	The Blessings of Israel
23:44:001:0	“ But now listen , O Jacob , My servant , And Israel , whom I have chosen :
23:44:002:0	Thus says the Lord who made youAnd formed you from the womb , who will help you , ‘Do not fear , O Jacob My servant ; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen .
23:44:003:0	For I will pour out water on the thirsty landAnd streams on the dry ground ; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspringAnd My blessing on your descendants ;
23:44:004:0	And they will spring up among the grassLike poplars by streams of water . ’
23:44:005:0	This one will say , ‘I am the Lord’s’ ; And that one will call on the name of Jacob ; And another will write on his hand , ‘Belonging to the Lord , ’And will name Israel’s name with honor .
23:44:006:0	“ Thus says the Lord , the King of Israel and his Redeemer , the Lord of hosts : ‘I am the first and I am the last , And there is no God besides Me .
23:44:007:0	Who is like Me ? Let him proclaim and declare it ; Yes , let him recount it to Me in order , From the time that I established the ancient nation . And let them declare to them the things that are comingAnd the events that are going to take place .
23:44:002:1	The Folly of Idolatry
23:44:008:0	Do not tremble and do not be afraid ; Have I not long since announced it to you and declared it ? And you are My witnesses . Is there any God besides Me , Or is there any other Rock ? I know of none . ’ ”
23:44:009:0	Those who fashion a graven image are all of them futile , and their precious things are of no profit ; even their own witnesses fail to see or know , so that they will be put to shame .
23:44:010:0	Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no profit ?
23:44:011:0	Behold , all his companions will be put to shame , for the craftsmen themselves are mere men . Let them all assemble themselves , let them stand up , let them tremble , let them together be put to shame .
23:44:012:0	The man shapes iron into a cutting tool and does his work over the coals , fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm . He also gets hungry and his strength fails ; he drinks no water and becomes weary .
23:44:013:0	Another shapes wood , he extends a measuring line ; he outlines it with red chalk . He works it with planes and outlines it with a compass , and makes it like the form of a man , like the beauty of man , so that it may sit in a house .
23:44:014:0	Surely he cuts cedars for himself , and takes a cypress or an oak and raises it for himself among the trees of the forest . He plants a fir , and the rain makes it grow .
23:44:015:0	Then it becomes something for a man to burn , so he takes one of them and warms himself ; he also makes a fire to bake bread . He also makes a god and worships it ; he makes it a graven image and falls down before it .
23:44:016:0	Half of it he burns in the fire ; over this half he eats meat as he roasts a roast and is satisfied . He also warms himself and says , “ Aha ! I am warm , I have seen the fire . ”
23:44:017:0	But the rest of it he makes into a god , his graven image . He falls down before it and worships ; he also prays to it and says , “ Deliver me , for you are my god . ”
23:44:018:0	They do not know , nor do they understand , for He has smeared over their eyes so that they cannot see and their hearts so that they cannot comprehend .
23:44:019:0	No one recalls , nor is there knowledge or understanding to say , “ I have burned half of it in the fire and also have baked bread over its coals . I roast meat and eat it . Then I make the rest of it into an abomination , I fall down before a block of wood ! ”
23:44:003:1	God Forgives and Redeems
23:44:020:0	He feeds on ashes ; a deceived heart has turned him aside . And he cannot deliver himself , nor say , “ Is there not a lie in my right hand ? ”
23:44:021:0	“ Remember these things , O Jacob , And Israel , for you are My servant ; I have formed you , you are My servant , O Israel , you will not be forgotten by Me .
23:44:022:0	I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloudAnd your sins like a heavy mist . Return to Me , for I have redeemed you . ”
23:44:023:0	Shout for joy , O heavens , for the Lord has done it ! Shout joyfully , you lower parts of the earth ; Break forth into a shout of joy , you mountains , O forest , and every tree in it ; For the Lord has redeemed JacobAnd in Israel He shows forth His glory .
23:44:024:0	Thus says the Lord , your Redeemer , and the one who formed you from the womb , “ I , the Lord , am the maker of all things , Stretching out the heavens by MyselfAnd spreading out the earth all alone ,
23:44:025:0	Causing the omens of boasters to fail , Making fools out of diviners , Causing wise men to draw backAnd turning their knowledge into foolishness ,
23:44:026:0	Confirming the word of His servantAnd performing the purpose of His messengers . It is I who says of Jerusalem , ‘She shall be inhabited ! ’And of the cities of Judah , ‘They shall be built . ’And I will raise up her ruins again .
23:44:027:0	It is I who says to the depth of the sea , ‘Be dried up ! ’And I will make your rivers dry .
23:44:028:0	It is I who says of Cyrus , ‘He is My shepherd ! And he will perform all My desire . ’And he declares of Jerusalem , ‘She will be built , ’And of the temple , ‘Your foundation will be laid . ’ ”
