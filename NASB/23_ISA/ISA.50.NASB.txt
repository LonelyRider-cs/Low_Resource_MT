23:50:001:1	God Helps His Servant
23:50:001:0	Thus says the Lord , “ Where is the certificate of divorceBy which I have sent your mother away ? Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you ? Behold , you were sold for your iniquities , And for your transgressions your mother was sent away .
23:50:002:0	Why was there no man when I came ? When I called , why was there none to answer ? Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom ? Or have I no power to deliver ? Behold , I dry up the sea with My rebuke , I make the rivers a wilderness ; Their fish stink for lack of waterAnd die of thirst .
23:50:003:0	I clothe the heavens with blacknessAnd make sackcloth their covering . ”
23:50:004:0	The Lord God has given Me the tongue of disciples , That I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word . He awakens Me morning by morning , He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple .
23:50:005:0	The Lord God has opened My ear ; And I was not disobedientNor did I turn back .
23:50:006:0	I gave My back to those who strike Me , And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard ; I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting .
23:50:007:0	For the Lord God helps Me , Therefore , I am not disgraced ; Therefore , I have set My face like flint , And I know that I will not be ashamed .
23:50:008:0	He who vindicates Me is near ; Who will contend with Me ? Let us stand up to each other ; Who has a case against Me ? Let him draw near to Me .
23:50:009:0	Behold , the Lord God helps Me ; Who is he who condemns Me ? Behold , they will all wear out like a garment ; The moth will eat them .
23:50:010:0	Who is among you that fears the Lord , That obeys the voice of His servant , That walks in darkness and has no light ? Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God .
23:50:011:0	Behold , all you who kindle a fire , Who encircle yourselves with firebrands , Walk in the light of your fireAnd among the brands you have set ablaze . This you will have from My hand : You will lie down in torment .
