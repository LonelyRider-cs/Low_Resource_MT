23:37:001:1	Hezekiah Seeks Isaiah’s Help
23:37:001:0	And when King Hezekiah heard it , he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the Lord .
23:37:002:0	Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
23:37:003:0	They said to him , “ Thus says Hezekiah , ‘This day is a day of distress , rebuke and rejection ; for children have come to birth , and there is no strength to deliver .
23:37:004:0	Perhaps the Lord your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh , whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God , and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard . Therefore , offer a prayer for the remnant that is left . ’ ”
23:37:005:0	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
23:37:006:0	Isaiah said to them , “ Thus you shall say to your master , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me .
23:37:007:0	Behold , I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land . And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land . ” ’ ”
23:37:008:0	Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah , for he had heard that the king had left Lachish .
23:37:009:0	When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush , “ He has come out to fight against you , ” and when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
23:37:010:0	“ Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah , ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , “ Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . ”
23:37:011:0	Behold , you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands , destroying them completely . So will you be spared ?
23:37:012:0	Did the gods of those nations which my fathers have destroyed deliver them , even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar ?
23:37:002:1	Hezekiah’s Prayer in the Temple
23:37:013:0	Where is the king of Hamath , the king of Arpad , the king of the city of Sepharvaim , and of Hena and Ivvah ? ’ ”
23:37:014:0	Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it , and he went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord .
23:37:015:0	Hezekiah prayed to the Lord saying ,
23:37:016:0	“ O Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , who is enthroned above the cherubim , You are the God , You alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
23:37:017:0	Incline Your ear , O Lord , and hear ; open Your eyes , O Lord , and see ; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib , who sent them to reproach the living God .
23:37:018:0	Truly , O Lord , the kings of Assyria have devastated all the countries and their lands ,
23:37:019:0	and have cast their gods into the fire , for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands , wood and stone . So they have destroyed them .
23:37:003:1	God Answers through Isaiah
23:37:020:0	Now , O Lord our God , deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone , Lord , are God . ”
23:37:021:0	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah , saying , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria ,
23:37:022:0	this is the word that the Lord has spoken against him : “ She has despised you and mocked you , The virgin daughter of Zion ; She has shaken her head behind you , The daughter of Jerusalem !
23:37:023:0	Whom have you reproached and blasphemed ? And against whom have you raised your voiceAnd haughtily lifted up your eyes ? Against the Holy One of Israel !
23:37:024:0	Through your servants you have reproached the Lord , And you have said , ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains , To the remotest parts of Lebanon ; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses . And I will go to its highest peak , its thickest forest .
23:37:025:0	I dug wells and drank waters , And with the sole of my feet I dried upAll the rivers of Egypt . ’
23:37:026:0	Have you not heard ? Long ago I did it , From ancient times I planned it . Now I have brought it to pass , That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
23:37:027:0	Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength , They were dismayed and put to shame ; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb , As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up .
23:37:028:0	But I know your sitting downAnd your going out and your coming inAnd your raging against Me .
23:37:029:0	Because of your raging against MeAnd because your arrogance has come up to My ears , Therefore I will put My hook in your noseAnd My bridle in your lips , And I will turn you back by the way which you came .
23:37:030:0	“ Then this shall be the sign for you : you will eat this year what grows of itself , in the second year what springs from the same , and in the third year sow , reap , plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
23:37:031:0	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward .
23:37:032:0	For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant and out of Mount Zion survivors . The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this . ” ’
23:37:033:0	“ Therefore , thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , ‘He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there ; and he will not come before it with a shield , or throw up a siege ramp against it .
23:37:034:0	By the way that he came , by the same he will return , and he will not come to this city , ’ declares the Lord .
23:37:004:1	Assyrians Destroyed
23:37:035:0	‘For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake . ’ ”
23:37:036:0	Then the angel of the Lord went out and struck 185 , 000 in the camp of the Assyrians ; and when men arose early in the morning , behold , all of these were dead .
23:37:037:0	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh .
23:37:038:0	It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place .
