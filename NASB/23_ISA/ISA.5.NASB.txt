23:5:001:1	Parable of the Vineyard
23:5:001:0	Let me sing now for my well-belovedA song of my beloved concerning His vineyard . My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill .
23:5:002:0	He dug it all around , removed its stones , And planted it with the choicest vine . And He built a tower in the middle of itAnd also hewed out a wine vat in it ; Then He expected it to produce good grapes , But it produced only worthless ones .
23:5:003:0	“ And now , O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah , Judge between Me and My vineyard .
23:5:004:0	What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it ? Why , when I expected it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones ?
23:5:005:0	So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard : I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed ; I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground .
23:5:006:0	I will lay it waste ; It will not be pruned or hoed , But briars and thorns will come up . I will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it . ”
23:5:002:1	Woes for the Wicked
23:5:007:0	For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of IsraelAnd the men of Judah His delightful plant . Thus He looked for justice , but behold , bloodshed ; For righteousness , but behold , a cry of distress .
23:5:008:0	Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field , Until there is no more room , So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land !
23:5:009:0	In my ears the Lord of hosts has sworn , “ Surely , many houses shall become desolate , Even great and fine ones , without occupants .
23:5:010:0	For ten acres of vineyard will yield only one bath of wine , And a homer of seed will yield but an ephah of grain . ”
23:5:011:0	Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink , Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them !
23:5:012:0	Their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp , by tambourine and flute , and by wine ; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the Lord , Nor do they consider the work of His hands .
23:5:013:0	Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge ; And their honorable men are famished , And their multitude is parched with thirst .
23:5:014:0	Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth without measure ; And Jerusalem’s splendor , her multitude , her din of revelry and the jubilant within her , descend into it .
23:5:015:0	So the common man will be humbled and the man of importance abased , The eyes of the proud also will be abased .
23:5:016:0	But the Lord of hosts will be exalted in judgment , And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness .
23:5:017:0	Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture , And strangers will eat in the waste places of the wealthy .
23:5:018:0	Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood , And sin as if with cart ropes ;
23:5:019:0	Who say , “ Let Him make speed , let Him hasten His work , that we may see it ; And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw nearAnd come to pass , that we may know it ! ”
23:5:020:0	Woe to those who call evil good , and good evil ; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness ; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter !
23:5:021:0	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyesAnd clever in their own sight !
23:5:022:0	Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wineAnd valiant men in mixing strong drink ,
23:5:023:0	Who justify the wicked for a bribe , And take away the rights of the ones who are in the right !
23:5:024:0	Therefore , as a tongue of fire consumes stubbleAnd dry grass collapses into the flame , So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away as dust ; For they have rejected the law of the Lord of hostsAnd despised the word of the Holy One of Israel .
23:5:025:0	On this account the anger of the Lord has burned against His people , And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them down . And the mountains quaked , and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets . For all this His anger is not spent , But His hand is still stretched out .
23:5:026:0	He will also lift up a standard to the distant nation , And will whistle for it from the ends of the earth ; And behold , it will come with speed swiftly .
23:5:027:0	No one in it is weary or stumbles , None slumbers or sleeps ; Nor is the belt at its waist undone , Nor its sandal strap broken .
23:5:028:0	Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent ; The hoofs of its horses seem like flint and its chariot wheels like a whirlwind .
23:5:029:0	Its roaring is like a lioness , and it roars like young lions ; It growls as it seizes the preyAnd carries it off with no one to deliver it .
23:5:030:0	And it will growl over it in that day like the roaring of the sea . If one looks to the land , behold , there is darkness and distress ; Even the light is darkened by its clouds .
