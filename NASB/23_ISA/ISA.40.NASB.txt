23:40:001:1	The Greatness of God
23:40:001:0	“ Comfort , O comfort My people , ” says your God .
23:40:002:0	“ Speak kindly to Jerusalem ; And call out to her , that her warfare has ended , That her iniquity has been removed , That she has received of the Lord’s handDouble for all her sins . ”
23:40:003:0	A voice is calling , “ Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness ; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God .
23:40:004:0	Let every valley be lifted up , And every mountain and hill be made low ; And let the rough ground become a plain , And the rugged terrain a broad valley ;
23:40:005:0	Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed , And all flesh will see it together ; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken . ”
23:40:006:0	A voice says , “ Call out . ” Then he answered , “ What shall I call out ? ” All flesh is grass , and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field .
23:40:007:0	The grass withers , the flower fades , When the breath of the Lord blows upon it ; Surely the people are grass .
23:40:008:0	The grass withers , the flower fades , But the word of our God stands forever .
23:40:009:0	Get yourself up on a high mountain , O Zion , bearer of good news , Lift up your voice mightily , O Jerusalem , bearer of good news ; Lift it up , do not fear . Say to the cities of Judah , “ Here is your God ! ”
23:40:010:0	Behold , the Lord God will come with might , With His arm ruling for Him . Behold , His reward is with HimAnd His recompense before Him .
23:40:011:0	Like a shepherd He will tend His flock , In His arm He will gather the lambsAnd carry them in His bosom ; He will gently lead the nursing ewes .
23:40:012:0	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand , And marked off the heavens by the span , And calculated the dust of the earth by the measure , And weighed the mountains in a balanceAnd the hills in a pair of scales ?
23:40:013:0	Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord , Or as His counselor has informed Him ?
23:40:014:0	With whom did He consult and who gave Him understanding ? And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledgeAnd informed Him of the way of understanding ?
23:40:015:0	Behold , the nations are like a drop from a bucket , And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales ; Behold , He lifts up the islands like fine dust .
23:40:016:0	Even Lebanon is not enough to burn , Nor its beasts enough for a burnt offering .
23:40:017:0	All the nations are as nothing before Him , They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless .
23:40:018:0	To whom then will you liken God ? Or what likeness will you compare with Him ?
23:40:019:0	As for the idol , a craftsman casts it , A goldsmith plates it with gold , And a silversmith fashions chains of silver .
23:40:020:0	He who is too impoverished for such an offeringSelects a tree that does not rot ; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsmanTo prepare an idol that will not totter .
23:40:021:0	Do you not know ? Have you not heard ? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning ? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
23:40:022:0	It is He who sits above the circle of the earth , And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers , Who stretches out the heavens like a curtainAnd spreads them out like a tent to dwell in .
23:40:023:0	He it is who reduces rulers to nothing , Who makes the judges of the earth meaningless .
23:40:024:0	Scarcely have they been planted , Scarcely have they been sown , Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth , But He merely blows on them , and they wither , And the storm carries them away like stubble .
23:40:025:0	“ To whom then will you liken MeThat I would be his equal ? ” says the Holy One .
23:40:026:0	Lift up your eyes on highAnd see who has created these stars , The One who leads forth their host by number , He calls them all by name ; Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power , Not one of them is missing .
23:40:027:0	Why do you say , O Jacob , and assert , O Israel , “ My way is hidden from the Lord , And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God ” ?
23:40:028:0	Do you not know ? Have you not heard ? The Everlasting God , the Lord , the Creator of the ends of the earthDoes not become weary or tired . His understanding is inscrutable .
23:40:029:0	He gives strength to the weary , And to him who lacks might He increases power .
23:40:030:0	Though youths grow weary and tired , And vigorous young men stumble badly ,
23:40:031:0	Yet those who wait for the LordWill gain new strength ; They will mount up with wings like eagles , They will run and not get tired , They will walk and not become weary .
