23:24:001:1	Judgment on the Earth
23:24:001:0	Behold , the Lord lays the earth waste , devastates it , distorts its surface and scatters its inhabitants .
23:24:002:0	And the people will be like the priest , the servant like his master , the maid like her mistress , the buyer like the seller , the lender like the borrower , the creditor like the debtor .
23:24:003:0	The earth will be completely laid waste and completely despoiled , for the Lord has spoken this word .
23:24:004:0	The earth mourns and withers , the world fades and withers , the exalted of the people of the earth fade away .
23:24:005:0	The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants , for they transgressed laws , violated statutes , broke the everlasting covenant .
23:24:006:0	Therefore , a curse devours the earth , and those who live in it are held guilty . Therefore , the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men are left .
23:24:007:0	The new wine mourns , The vine decays , All the merry-hearted sigh .
23:24:008:0	The gaiety of tambourines ceases , The noise of revelers stops , The gaiety of the harp ceases .
23:24:009:0	They do not drink wine with song ; Strong drink is bitter to those who drink it .
23:24:010:0	The city of chaos is broken down ; Every house is shut up so that none may enter .
23:24:011:0	There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine ; All joy turns to gloom . The gaiety of the earth is banished .
23:24:012:0	Desolation is left in the cityAnd the gate is battered to ruins .
23:24:013:0	For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples , As the shaking of an olive tree , As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over .
23:24:014:0	They raise their voices , they shout for joy ; They cry out from the west concerning the majesty of the Lord .
23:24:015:0	Therefore glorify the Lord in the east , The name of the Lord , the God of Israel , In the coastlands of the sea .
23:24:016:0	From the ends of the earth we hear songs , “ Glory to the Righteous One , ” But I say , “ Woe to me ! Woe to me ! Alas for me ! The treacherous deal treacherously , And the treacherous deal very treacherously . ”
23:24:017:0	Terror and pit and snareConfront you , O inhabitant of the earth .
23:24:018:0	Then it will be that he who flees the report of disaster will fall into the pit , And he who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare ; For the windows above are opened , and the foundations of the earth shake .
23:24:019:0	The earth is broken asunder , The earth is split through , The earth is shaken violently .
23:24:020:0	The earth reels to and fro like a drunkardAnd it totters like a shack , For its transgression is heavy upon it , And it will fall , never to rise again .
23:24:021:0	So it will happen in that day , That the Lord will punish the host of heaven on high , And the kings of the earth on earth .
23:24:022:0	They will be gathered together Like prisoners in the dungeon , And will be confined in prison ; And after many days they will be punished .
23:24:023:0	Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed , For the Lord of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem , And His glory will be before His elders .
