23:15:001:1	Judgment on Moab
23:15:001:0	The oracle concerning Moab . Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined ; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined .
23:15:002:0	They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon , even to the high places to weep . Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba ; Everyoneâ€™s head is bald and every beard is cut off .
23:15:003:0	In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth ; On their housetops and in their squaresEveryone is wailing , dissolved in tears .
23:15:004:0	Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out , Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz ; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud ; His soul trembles within him .
23:15:005:0	My heart cries out for Moab ; His fugitives are as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah , For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping ; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their ruin .
23:15:006:0	For the waters of Nimrim are desolate . Surely the grass is withered , the tender grass died out , There is no green thing .
23:15:007:0	Therefore the abundance which they have acquired and stored upThey carry off over the brook of Arabim .
23:15:008:0	For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab , Its wail goes as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim .
23:15:009:0	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood ; Surely I will bring added woes upon Dimon , A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land .
