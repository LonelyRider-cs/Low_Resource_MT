23:52:001:1	Cheer for Prostrate Zion
23:52:001:0	Awake , awake , Clothe yourself in your strength , O Zion ; Clothe yourself in your beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city ; For the uncircumcised and the uncleanWill no longer come into you .
23:52:002:0	Shake yourself from the dust , rise up , O captive Jerusalem ; Loose yourself from the chains around your neck , O captive daughter of Zion .
23:52:003:0	For thus says the Lord , “ You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed without money . ”
23:52:004:0	For thus says the Lord God , “ My people went down at the first into Egypt to reside there ; then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause .
23:52:005:0	Now therefore , what do I have here , ” declares the Lord , “ seeing that My people have been taken away without cause ? ” Again the Lord declares , “ Those who rule over them howl , and My name is continually blasphemed all day long .
23:52:006:0	Therefore My people shall know My name ; therefore in that day I am the one who is speaking , ‘Here I am . ’ ”
23:52:007:0	How lovely on the mountainsAre the feet of him who brings good news , Who announces peaceAnd brings good news of happiness , Who announces salvation , And says to Zion , “ Your God reigns ! ”
23:52:008:0	Listen ! Your watchmen lift up their voices , They shout joyfully together ; For they will see with their own eyesWhen the Lord restores Zion .
23:52:009:0	Break forth , shout joyfully together , You waste places of Jerusalem ; For the Lord has comforted His people , He has redeemed Jerusalem .
23:52:010:0	The Lord has bared His holy armIn the sight of all the nations , That all the ends of the earth may seeThe salvation of our God .
23:52:011:0	Depart , depart , go out from there , Touch nothing unclean ; Go out of the midst of her , purify yourselves , You who carry the vessels of the Lord .
23:52:002:1	The Exalted Servant
23:52:012:0	But you will not go out in haste , Nor will you go as fugitives ; For the Lord will go before you , And the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
23:52:013:0	Behold , My servant will prosper , He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted .
23:52:014:0	Just as many were astonished at you , My people , So His appearance was marred more than any manAnd His form more than the sons of men .
23:52:015:0	Thus He will sprinkle many nations , Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him ; For what had not been told them they will see , And what they had not heard they will understand .
