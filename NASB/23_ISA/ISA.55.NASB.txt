23:55:001:1	The Free Offer of Mercy
23:55:001:0	“ Ho ! Every one who thirsts , come to the waters ; And you who have no money come , buy and eat . Come , buy wine and milkWithout money and without cost .
23:55:002:0	Why do you spend money for what is not bread , And your wages for what does not satisfy ? Listen carefully to Me , and eat what is good , And delight yourself in abundance .
23:55:003:0	Incline your ear and come to Me . Listen , that you may live ; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you , According to the faithful mercies shown to David .
23:55:004:0	Behold , I have made him a witness to the peoples , A leader and commander for the peoples .
23:55:005:0	Behold , you will call a nation you do not know , And a nation which knows you not will run to you , Because of the Lord your God , even the Holy One of Israel ; For He has glorified you . ”
23:55:006:0	Seek the Lord while He may be found ; Call upon Him while He is near .
23:55:007:0	Let the wicked forsake his wayAnd the unrighteous man his thoughts ; And let him return to the Lord , And He will have compassion on him , And to our God , For He will abundantly pardon .
23:55:008:0	“ For My thoughts are not your thoughts , Nor are your ways My ways , ” declares the Lord .
23:55:009:0	“ For as the heavens are higher than the earth , So are My ways higher than your waysAnd My thoughts than your thoughts .
23:55:010:0	For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven , And do not return there without watering the earthAnd making it bear and sprout , And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater ;
23:55:011:0	So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth ; It will not return to Me empty , Without accomplishing what I desire , And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it .
23:55:012:0	For you will go out with joyAnd be led forth with peace ; The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you , And all the trees of the field will clap their hands .
23:55:013:0	Instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up , And instead of the nettle the myrtle will come up , And it will be a memorial to the Lord , For an everlasting sign which will not be cut off . ”
