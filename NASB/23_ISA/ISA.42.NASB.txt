23:42:001:1	God’s Promise concerning His Servant
23:42:001:0	“ Behold , My Servant , whom I uphold ; My chosen one in whom My soul delights . I have put My Spirit upon Him ; He will bring forth justice to the nations .
23:42:002:0	He will not cry out or raise His voice , Nor make His voice heard in the street .
23:42:003:0	A bruised reed He will not breakAnd a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish ; He will faithfully bring forth justice .
23:42:004:0	He will not be disheartened or crushedUntil He has established justice in the earth ; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law . ”
23:42:005:0	Thus says God the Lord , Who created the heavens and stretched them out , Who spread out the earth and its offspring , Who gives breath to the people on itAnd spirit to those who walk in it ,
23:42:006:0	“ I am the Lord , I have called You in righteousness , I will also hold You by the hand and watch over You , And I will appoint You as a covenant to the people , As a light to the nations ,
23:42:007:0	To open blind eyes , To bring out prisoners from the dungeonAnd those who dwell in darkness from the prison .
23:42:008:0	I am the Lord , that is My name ; I will not give My glory to another , Nor My praise to graven images .
23:42:009:0	Behold , the former things have come to pass , Now I declare new things ; Before they spring forth I proclaim them to you . ”
23:42:010:0	Sing to the Lord a new song , Sing His praise from the end of the earth ! You who go down to the sea , and all that is in it . You islands , and those who dwell on them .
23:42:011:0	Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voices , The settlements where Kedar inhabits . Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud , Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains .
23:42:012:0	Let them give glory to the LordAnd declare His praise in the coastlands .
23:42:002:1	The Blindness of the People
23:42:013:0	The Lord will go forth like a warrior , He will arouse His zeal like a man of war . He will utter a shout , yes , He will raise a war cry . He will prevail against His enemies .
23:42:014:0	“ I have kept silent for a long time , I have kept still and restrained Myself . Now like a woman in labor I will groan , I will both gasp and pant .
23:42:015:0	I will lay waste the mountains and hillsAnd wither all their vegetation ; I will make the rivers into coastlandsAnd dry up the ponds .
23:42:016:0	I will lead the blind by a way they do not know , In paths they do not know I will guide them . I will make darkness into light before themAnd rugged places into plains . These are the things I will do , And I will not leave them undone . ”
23:42:017:0	They will be turned back and be utterly put to shame , Who trust in idols , Who say to molten images , “ You are our gods . ”
23:42:018:0	Hear , you deaf ! And look , you blind , that you may see .
23:42:019:0	Who is blind but My servant , Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send ? Who is so blind as he that is at peace with Me , Or so blind as the servant of the Lord ?
23:42:020:0	You have seen many things , but you do not observe them ; Your ears are open , but none hears .
23:42:021:0	The Lord was pleased for His righteousness’ sakeTo make the law great and glorious .
23:42:022:0	But this is a people plundered and despoiled ; All of them are trapped in caves , Or are hidden away in prisons ; They have become a prey with none to deliver them , And a spoil , with none to say , “ Give them back ! ”
23:42:023:0	Who among you will give ear to this ? Who will give heed and listen hereafter ?
23:42:024:0	Who gave Jacob up for spoil , and Israel to plunderers ? Was it not the Lord , against whom we have sinned , And in whose ways they were not willing to walk , And whose law they did not obey ?
23:42:025:0	So He poured out on him the heat of His angerAnd the fierceness of battle ; And it set him aflame all around , Yet he did not recognize it ; And it burned him , but he paid no attention .
