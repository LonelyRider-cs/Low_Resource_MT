23:35:001:1	Zion’s Happy Future
23:35:001:0	The wilderness and the desert will be glad , And the Arabah will rejoice and blossom ; Like the crocus
23:35:002:0	It will blossom profuselyAnd rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy . The glory of Lebanon will be given to it , The majesty of Carmel and Sharon . They will see the glory of the Lord , The majesty of our God .
23:35:003:0	Encourage the exhausted , and strengthen the feeble .
23:35:004:0	Say to those with anxious heart , “ Take courage , fear not . Behold , your God will come with vengeance ; The recompense of God will come , But He will save you . ”
23:35:005:0	Then the eyes of the blind will be openedAnd the ears of the deaf will be unstopped .
23:35:006:0	Then the lame will leap like a deer , And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy . For waters will break forth in the wildernessAnd streams in the Arabah .
23:35:007:0	The scorched land will become a poolAnd the thirsty ground springs of water ; In the haunt of jackals , its resting place , Grass becomes reeds and rushes .
23:35:008:0	A highway will be there , a roadway , And it will be called the Highway of Holiness . The unclean will not travel on it , But it will be for him who walks that way , And fools will not wander on it .
23:35:009:0	No lion will be there , Nor will any vicious beast go up on it ; These will not be found there . But the redeemed will walk there ,
23:35:010:0	And the ransomed of the Lord will returnAnd come with joyful shouting to Zion , With everlasting joy upon their heads . They will find gladness and joy , And sorrow and sighing will flee away .
