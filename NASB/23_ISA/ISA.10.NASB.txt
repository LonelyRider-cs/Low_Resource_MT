23:10:001:1	Assyria Is God’s Instrument
23:10:001:0	Woe to those who enact evil statutesAnd to those who constantly record unjust decisions ,
23:10:002:0	So as to deprive the needy of justiceAnd rob the poor of My people of their rights , So that widows may be their spoilAnd that they may plunder the orphans .
23:10:003:0	Now what will you do in the day of punishment , And in the devastation which will come from afar ? To whom will you flee for help ? And where will you leave your wealth ?
23:10:004:0	Nothing remains but to crouch among the captivesOr fall among the slain . In spite of all this , His anger does not turn awayAnd His hand is still stretched out .
23:10:005:0	Woe to Assyria , the rod of My angerAnd the staff in whose hands is My indignation ,
23:10:006:0	I send it against a godless nationAnd commission it against the people of My furyTo capture booty and to seize plunder , And to trample them down like mud in the streets .
23:10:007:0	Yet it does not so intend , Nor does it plan so in its heart , But rather it is its purpose to destroyAnd to cut off many nations .
23:10:008:0	For it says , “ Are not my princes all kings ?
23:10:009:0	Is not Calno like Carchemish , Or Hamath like Arpad , Or Samaria like Damascus ?
23:10:010:0	As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols , Whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria ,
23:10:011:0	Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her imagesJust as I have done to Samaria and her idols ? ”
23:10:012:0	So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem , He will say , “ I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the pomp of his haughtiness . ”
23:10:013:0	For he has said , “ By the power of my hand and by my wisdom I did this , For I have understanding ; And I removed the boundaries of the peoplesAnd plundered their treasures , And like a mighty man I brought down their inhabitants ,
23:10:014:0	And my hand reached to the riches of the peoples like a nest , And as one gathers abandoned eggs , I gathered all the earth ; And there was not one that flapped its wing or opened its beak or chirped . ”
23:10:015:0	Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it ? Is the saw to exalt itself over the one who wields it ? That would be like a club wielding those who lift it , Or like a rod lifting him who is not wood .
23:10:016:0	Therefore the Lord , the God of hosts , will send a wasting disease among his stout warriors ; And under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning flame .
23:10:017:0	And the light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame , And it will burn and devour his thorns and his briars in a single day .
23:10:018:0	And He will destroy the glory of his forest and of his fruitful garden , both soul and body , And it will be as when a sick man wastes away .
23:10:002:1	A Remnant Will Return
23:10:019:0	And the rest of the trees of his forest will be so small in numberThat a child could write them down .
23:10:020:0	Now in that day the remnant of Israel , and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped , will never again rely on the one who struck them , but will truly rely on the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
23:10:021:0	A remnant will return , the remnant of Jacob , to the mighty God .
23:10:022:0	For though your people , O Israel , may be like the sand of the sea , Only a remnant within them will return ; A destruction is determined , overflowing with righteousness .
23:10:023:0	For a complete destruction , one that is decreed , the Lord God of hosts will execute in the midst of the whole land .
23:10:024:0	Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts , “ O My people who dwell in Zion , do not fear the Assyrian who strikes you with the rod and lifts up his staff against you , the way Egypt did .
23:10:025:0	For in a very little while My indignation against you will be spent and My anger will be directed to their destruction . ”
23:10:026:0	The Lord of hosts will arouse a scourge against him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb ; and His staff will be over the sea and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt .
23:10:027:0	So it will be in that day , that his burden will be removed from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck , and the yoke will be broken because of fatness .
23:10:028:0	He has come against Aiath , He has passed through Migron ; At Michmash he deposited his baggage .
23:10:029:0	They have gone through the pass , saying , “ Geba will be our lodging place . ” Ramah is terrified , and Gibeah of Saul has fled away .
23:10:030:0	Cry aloud with your voice , O daughter of Gallim ! Pay attention , Laishah and wretched Anathoth !
23:10:031:0	Madmenah has fled . The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge .
23:10:032:0	Yet today he will halt at Nob ; He shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
23:10:033:0	Behold , the Lord , the God of hosts , will lop off the boughs with a terrible crash ; Those also who are tall in stature will be cut downAnd those who are lofty will be abased .
23:10:034:0	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron axe , And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One .
