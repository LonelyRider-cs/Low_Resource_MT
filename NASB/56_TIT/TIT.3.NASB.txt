56:3:002:0	to malign no one , to be peaceable , gentle , showing every consideration for all men .
56:3:003:0	For we also once were foolish ourselves , disobedient , deceived , enslaved to various lusts and pleasures , spending our life in malice and envy , hateful , hating one another .
56:3:004:0	But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared ,
56:3:005:0	He saved us , not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness , but according to His mercy , by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit ,
56:3:006:0	whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56:3:007:0	so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
56:3:008:0	This is a trustworthy statement ; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently , so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds . These things are good and profitable for men .
56:3:009:0	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law , for they are unprofitable and worthless .
56:3:010:0	Reject a factious man after a first and second warning ,

56:3:014:0	Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs , so that they will not be unfruitful .
56:3:015:0	All who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
