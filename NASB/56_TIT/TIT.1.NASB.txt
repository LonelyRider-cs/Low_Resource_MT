56:1:001:1	Salutation
56:1:001:0	Paul , a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ , for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness ,
56:1:002:0	in the hope of eternal life , which God , who cannot lie , promised long ages ago ,
56:1:003:0	but at the proper time manifested , even His word , in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior ,
56:1:002:1	Qualifications of Elders
56:1:004:0	To Titus , my true child in a common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior .
56:1:005:0	For this reason I left you in Crete , that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you ,
56:1:006:0	namely , if any man is above reproach , the husband of one wife , having children who believe , not accused of dissipation or rebellion .
56:1:007:0	For the overseer must be above reproach as God’s steward , not self-willed , not quick-tempered , not addicted to wine , not pugnacious , not fond of sordid gain ,
56:1:008:0	but hospitable , loving what is good , sensible , just , devout , self-controlled ,
56:1:009:0	holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching , so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict .
56:1:010:0	For there are many rebellious men , empty talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision ,
56:1:011:0	who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families , teaching things they should not teach for the sake of sordid gain .
56:1:012:0	One of themselves , a prophet of their own , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . ”
56:1:013:0	This testimony is true . For this reason reprove them severely so that they may be sound in the faith ,
56:1:014:0	not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth .
56:1:015:0	To the pure , all things are pure ; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure , but both their mind and their conscience are defiled .
56:1:016:0	They profess to know God , but by their deeds they deny Him , being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed .
