56:2:001:0	But as for you , speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine .
56:2:002:0	Older men are to be temperate , dignified , sensible , sound in faith , in love , in perseverance .
56:2:003:0	Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior , not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine , teaching what is good ,
56:2:004:0	so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56:2:005:0	to be sensible , pure , workers at home , kind , being subject to their own husbands , so that the word of God will not be dishonored .
56:2:006:0	Likewise urge the young men to be sensible ;
56:2:007:0	in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds , with purity in doctrine , dignified ,
56:2:008:0	sound in speech which is beyond reproach , so that the opponent will be put to shame , having nothing bad to say about us .
56:2:009:0	Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything , to be well-pleasing , not argumentative ,
56:2:010:0	not pilfering , but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect .
56:2:011:0	For the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all men ,
56:2:012:0	instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly , righteously and godly in the present age ,
56:2:013:0	looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Christ Jesus ,
56:2:014:0	who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed , and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession , zealous for good deeds .
