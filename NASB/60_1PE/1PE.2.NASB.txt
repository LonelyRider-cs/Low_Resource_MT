60:2:001:1	As Newborn Babes
60:2:001:0	Therefore , putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander ,
60:2:002:0	like newborn babies , long for the pure milk of the word , so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation ,
60:2:002:1	As Living Stones
60:2:003:0	if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord .
60:2:004:0	And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men , but is choice and precious in the sight of God ,
60:2:005:0	you also , as living stones , are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60:2:006:0	For this is contained in Scripture : “ Behold , I lay in Zion a choice stone , a precious corner stone , And he who believes in Him will not be disappointed . ”
60:2:007:0	This precious value , then , is for you who believe ; but for those who disbelieve , “ The stone which the builders rejected , This became the very corner stone , ”
60:2:008:0	and , “ A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense ” ; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word , and to this doom they were also appointed .
60:2:009:0	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God’s own possession , so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light ;
60:2:010:0	for you once were not a people , but now you are the people of God ; you had not received mercy , but now you have received mercy .
60:2:011:0	Beloved , I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul .
60:2:003:1	Honor Authority
60:2:012:0	Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles , so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers , they may because of your good deeds , as they observe them , glorify God in the day of visitation .
60:2:013:0	Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution , whether to a king as the one in authority ,
60:2:014:0	or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right .
60:2:015:0	For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men .
60:2:016:0	Act as free men , and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil , but use it as bondslaves of God .
60:2:017:0	Honor all people , love the brotherhood , fear God , honor the king .
60:2:018:0	Servants , be submissive to your masters with all respect , not only to those who are good and gentle , but also to those who are unreasonable .
60:2:019:0	For this finds favor , if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly .
60:2:004:1	Christ Is Our Example
60:2:020:0	For what credit is there if , when you sin and are harshly treated , you endure it with patience ? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it , this finds favor with God .
60:2:021:0	For you have been called for this purpose , since Christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps ,
60:2:022:0	who committed no sin , nor was any deceit found in His mouth ;
60:2:023:0	and while being reviled , He did not revile in return ; while suffering , He uttered no threats , but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously ;
60:2:024:0	and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross , so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness ; for by His wounds you were healed .
60:2:025:0	For you were continually straying like sheep , but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls .
