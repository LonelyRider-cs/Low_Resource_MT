60:4:001:1	Keep Fervent in Your Love
60:4:001:0	Therefore , since Christ has suffered in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same purpose , because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ,
60:4:002:0	so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men , but for the will of God .
60:4:003:0	For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles , having pursued a course of sensuality , lusts , drunkenness , carousing , drinking parties and abominable idolatries .
60:4:004:0	In all this , they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation , and they malign you ;
60:4:005:0	but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60:4:006:0	For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead , that though they are judged in the flesh as men , they may live in the spirit according to the will of God .
60:4:007:0	The end of all things is near ; therefore , be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer .
60:4:008:0	Above all , keep fervent in your love for one another , because love covers a multitude of sins .
60:4:009:0	Be hospitable to one another without complaint .
60:4:010:0	As each one has received a special gift , employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
60:4:002:1	Share the Sufferings of Christ
60:4:011:0	Whoever speaks , is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God ; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies ; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60:4:012:0	Beloved , do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you , which comes upon you for your testing , as though some strange thing were happening to you ;
60:4:013:0	but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ , keep on rejoicing , so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation .
60:4:014:0	If you are reviled for the name of Christ , you are blessed , because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you .
60:4:015:0	Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer , or thief , or evildoer , or a troublesome meddler ;
60:4:016:0	but if anyone suffers as a Christian , he is not to be ashamed , but is to glorify God in this name .
60:4:017:0	For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God ; and if it begins with us first , what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God ?
60:4:018:0	And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved , what will become of the godless man and the sinner ?
60:4:019:0	Therefore , those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right .
