60:1:001:1	A Living Hope , and a Sure Salvation
60:1:001:0	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who reside as aliens , scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia , who are chosen
60:1:002:0	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , by the sanctifying work of the Spirit , to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood : May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure .
60:1:003:0	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60:1:004:0	to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away , reserved in heaven for you ,
60:1:005:0	who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
60:1:006:0	In this you greatly rejoice , even though now for a little while , if necessary , you have been distressed by various trials ,
60:1:007:0	so that the proof of your faith , being more precious than gold which is perishable , even though tested by fire , may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
60:1:008:0	and though you have not seen Him , you love Him , and though you do not see Him now , but believe in Him , you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory ,
60:1:009:0	obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls .
60:1:010:0	As to this salvation , the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries ,
60:1:011:0	seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow .
60:1:012:0	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves , but you , in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look .
60:1:013:0	Therefore , prepare your minds for action , keep sober in spirit , fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60:1:014:0	As obedient children , do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance ,
60:1:015:0	but like the Holy One who called you , be holy yourselves also in all your behavior ;
60:1:016:0	because it is written , “ You shall be holy , for I am holy . ”
60:1:017:0	If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work , conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth ;
60:1:018:0	knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers ,
60:1:019:0	but with precious blood , as of a lamb unblemished and spotless , the blood of Christ .
60:1:020:0	For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world , but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you
60:1:021:0	who through Him are believers in God , who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
60:1:022:0	Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren , fervently love one another from the heart ,
60:1:023:0	for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable , that is , through the living and enduring word of God .
60:1:024:0	For , “ All flesh is like grass , And all its glory like the flower of grass . The grass withers , And the flower falls off ,
60:1:025:0	But the word of the Lord endures forever . ” And this is the word which was preached to you .
