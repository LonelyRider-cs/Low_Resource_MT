60:3:001:1	Godly Living
60:3:001:0	In the same way , you wives , be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word , they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives ,
60:3:002:0	as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior .
60:3:003:0	Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the hair , and wearing gold jewelry , or putting on dresses ;
60:3:004:0	but let it be the hidden person of the heart , with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is precious in the sight of God .
60:3:005:0	For in this way in former times the holy women also , who hoped in God , used to adorn themselves , being submissive to their own husbands ;
60:3:006:0	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear .
60:3:007:0	You husbands in the same way , live with your wives in an understanding way , as with someone weaker , since she is a woman ; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered .
60:3:008:0	To sum up , all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , brotherly , kindhearted , and humble in spirit ;
60:3:009:0	not returning evil for evil or insult for insult , but giving a blessing instead ; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing .
60:3:010:0	For , “ The one who desires life , to love and see good days , Must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
60:3:011:0	He must turn away from evil and do good ; He must seek peace and pursue it .
60:3:012:0	For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous , And His ears attend to their prayer , But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . ”
60:3:013:0	Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good ?
60:3:014:0	But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness , you are blessed . And do not fear their intimidation , and do not be troubled ,
60:3:015:0	but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts , always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you , yet with gentleness and reverence ;
60:3:016:0	and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered , those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame .
60:3:017:0	For it is better , if God should will it so , that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong .
60:3:018:0	For Christ also died for sins once for all , the just for the unjust , so that He might bring us to God , having been put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ;
60:3:019:0	in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison ,
60:3:020:0	who once were disobedient , when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah , during the construction of the ark , in which a few , that is , eight persons , were brought safely through the water .
60:3:021:0	Corresponding to that , baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh , but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60:3:022:0	who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him .
