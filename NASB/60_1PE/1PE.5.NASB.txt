60:5:001:1	Serve God Willingly
60:5:001:0	Therefore , I exhort the elders among you , as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ , and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed ,
60:5:002:0	shepherd the flock of God among you , exercising oversight not under compulsion , but voluntarily , according to the will of God ; and not for sordid gain , but with eagerness ;
60:5:003:0	nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge , but proving to be examples to the flock .
60:5:004:0	And when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the unfading crown of glory .
60:5:005:0	You younger men , likewise , be subject to your elders ; and all of you , clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , for God is opposed to the proud , but gives grace to the humble .
60:5:006:0	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God , that He may exalt you at the proper time ,
60:5:007:0	casting all your anxiety on Him , because He cares for you .
60:5:008:0	Be of sober spirit , be on the alert . Your adversary , the devil , prowls around like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour .
60:5:009:0	But resist him , firm in your faith , knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world .
60:5:010:0	After you have suffered for a little while , the God of all grace , who called you to His eternal glory in Christ , will Himself perfect , confirm , strengthen and establish you .
60:5:011:0	To Him be dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60:5:012:0	Through Silvanus , our faithful brother ( for so I regard him ) , I have written to you briefly , exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God . Stand firm in it !
60:5:013:0	She who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , sends you greetings , and so does my son , Mark .
60:5:014:0	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace be to you all who are in Christ .
