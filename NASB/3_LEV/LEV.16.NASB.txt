3:16:001:1	Law of Atonement
3:16:001:0	Now the Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron , when they had approached the presence of the Lord and died .
3:16:002:0	The Lord said to Moses : “ Tell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter at any time into the holy place inside the veil , before the mercy seat which is on the ark , or he will die ; for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat .
3:16:003:0	Aaron shall enter the holy place with this : with a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering .
3:16:004:0	He shall put on the holy linen tunic , and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body , and he shall be girded with the linen sash and attired with the linen turban ( these are holy garments ) . Then he shall bathe his body in water and put them on .
3:16:005:0	He shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering .
3:16:006:0	Then Aaron shall offer the bull for the sin offering which is for himself , that he may make atonement for himself and for his household .
3:16:007:0	He shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting .
3:16:008:0	Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats , one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scapegoat .
3:16:009:0	Then Aaron shall offer the goat on which the lot for the Lord fell , and make it a sin offering .
3:16:010:0	But the goat on which the lot for the scapegoat fell shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make atonement upon it , to send it into the wilderness as the scapegoat .
3:16:011:0	“ Then Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering which is for himself and make atonement for himself and for his household , and he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself .
3:16:012:0	He shall take a firepan full of coals of fire from upon the altar before the Lord and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense , and bring it inside the veil .
3:16:013:0	He shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord , that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the ark of the testimony , otherwise he will die .
3:16:014:0	Moreover , he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side ; also in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times .
3:16:015:0	“ Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people , and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull , and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat .
3:16:016:0	He shall make atonement for the holy place , because of the impurities of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins ; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which abides with them in the midst of their impurities .
3:16:017:0	When he goes in to make atonement in the holy place , no one shall be in the tent of meeting until he comes out , that he may make atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel .
3:16:018:0	Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord and make atonement for it , and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides .
3:16:019:0	With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it , and from the impurities of the sons of Israel consecrate it .
3:16:020:0	“ When he finishes atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar , he shall offer the live goat .
3:16:021:0	Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat , and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins ; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands in readiness .
3:16:022:0	The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land ; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness .
3:16:023:0	“ Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there .
3:16:024:0	He shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes , and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people .
3:16:025:0	Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar .
3:16:026:0	The one who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water ; then afterward he shall come into the camp .
3:16:027:0	But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place , shall be taken outside the camp , and they shall burn their hides , their flesh , and their refuse in the fire .
3:16:002:1	An Annual Atonement
3:16:028:0	Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water , then afterward he shall come into the camp .
3:16:029:0	“ This shall be a permanent statute for you : in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , you shall humble your souls and not do any work , whether the native , or the alien who sojourns among you ;
3:16:030:0	for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you ; you will be clean from all your sins before the Lord .
3:16:031:0	It is to be a sabbath of solemn rest for you , that you may humble your souls ; it is a permanent statute .
3:16:032:0	So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father’s place shall make atonement : he shall thus put on the linen garments , the holy garments ,
3:16:033:0	and make atonement for the holy sanctuary , and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar . He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly .
3:16:034:0	Now you shall have this as a permanent statute , to make atonement for the sons of Israel for all their sins once every year . ” And just as the Lord had commanded Moses , so he did .
