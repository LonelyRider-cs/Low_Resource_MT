3:8:001:1	The Consecration of Aaron and His Sons
3:8:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:8:002:0	“ Take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering , and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread ,
3:8:003:0	and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting . ”
3:8:004:0	So Moses did just as the Lord commanded him . When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of meeting ,
3:8:005:0	Moses said to the congregation , “ This is the thing which the Lord has commanded to do . ”
3:8:006:0	Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and washed them with water .
3:8:007:0	He put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash , and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him ; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod , with which he tied it to him .
3:8:008:0	He then placed the breastpiece on him , and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim .
3:8:009:0	He also placed the turban on his head , and on the turban , at its front , he placed the golden plate , the holy crown , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:8:010:0	Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it , and consecrated them .
3:8:011:0	He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils , and the basin and its stand , to consecrate them .
3:8:012:0	Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him , to consecrate him .
3:8:013:0	Next Moses had Aaron’s sons come near and clothed them with tunics , and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:8:014:0	Then he brought the bull of the sin offering , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering .
3:8:015:0	Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar , and purified the altar . Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it , to make atonement for it .
3:8:016:0	He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver , and the two kidneys and their fat ; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar .
3:8:017:0	But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:8:018:0	Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram .
3:8:019:0	Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
3:8:020:0	When he had cut the ram into its pieces , Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke .
3:8:021:0	After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water , Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar . It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma ; it was an offering by fire to the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:8:022:0	Then he presented the second ram , the ram of ordination , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram .
3:8:023:0	Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear , and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot .
3:8:024:0	He also had Aaron’s sons come near ; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear , and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot . Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood around on the altar .
3:8:025:0	He took the fat , and the fat tail , and all the fat that was on the entrails , and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh .
3:8:026:0	From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord , he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer , and placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh .
3:8:027:0	He then put all these on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons and presented them as a wave offering before the Lord .
3:8:028:0	Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering . They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma ; it was an offering by fire to the Lord .
3:8:029:0	Moses also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before the Lord ; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:8:030:0	So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron , on his garments , on his sons , and on the garments of his sons with him ; and he consecrated Aaron , his garments , and his sons , and the garments of his sons with him .
3:8:031:0	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons , “ Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting , and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering , just as I commanded , saying , ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it . ’
3:8:032:0	The remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire .
3:8:033:0	You shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days , until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled ; for he will ordain you through seven days .
3:8:034:0	The Lord has commanded to do as has been done this day , to make atonement on your behalf .
3:8:035:0	At the doorway of the tent of meeting , moreover , you shall remain day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the Lord , so that you will not die , for so I have been commanded . ”
3:8:036:0	Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord had commanded through Moses .
