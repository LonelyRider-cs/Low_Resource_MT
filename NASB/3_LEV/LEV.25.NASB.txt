3:25:001:1	The Sabbatic Year and Year of Jubilee
3:25:001:0	The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai , saying ,
3:25:002:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘When you come into the land which I shall give you , then the land shall have a sabbath to the Lord .
3:25:003:0	Six years you shall sow your field , and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop ,
3:25:004:0	but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest , a sabbath to the Lord ; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard .
3:25:005:0	Your harvest’s aftergrowth you shall not reap , and your grapes of untrimmed vines you shall not gather ; the land shall have a sabbatical year .
3:25:006:0	All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food ; yourself , and your male and female slaves , and your hired man and your foreign resident , those who live as aliens with you .
3:25:007:0	Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat .
3:25:008:0	‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself , seven times seven years , so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years , namely , forty-nine years .
3:25:009:0	You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month ; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land .
3:25:010:0	You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants . It shall be a jubilee for you , and each of you shall return to his own property , and each of you shall return to his family .
3:25:011:0	You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee ; you shall not sow , nor reap its aftergrowth , nor gather in from its untrimmed vines .
3:25:012:0	For it is a jubilee ; it shall be holy to you . You shall eat its crops out of the field .
3:25:013:0	‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property .
3:25:014:0	If you make a sale , moreover , to your friend or buy from your friend’s hand , you shall not wrong one another .
3:25:015:0	Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee , you shall buy from your friend ; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops .
3:25:016:0	In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price , and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price , for it is a number of crops he is selling to you .
3:25:017:0	So you shall not wrong one another , but you shall fear your God ; for I am the Lord your God .
3:25:018:0	‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments , so as to carry them out , that you may live securely on the land .
3:25:019:0	Then the land will yield its produce , so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it .
3:25:020:0	But if you say , “ What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our crops ? ”
3:25:021:0	then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years .
3:25:002:1	The Law of Redemption
3:25:022:0	When you are sowing the eighth year , you can still eat old things from the crop , eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in .
3:25:023:0	‘The land , moreover , shall not be sold permanently , for the land is Mine ; for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me .
3:25:024:0	Thus for every piece of your property , you are to provide for the redemption of the land .
3:25:025:0	‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of his property , then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his relative has sold .
3:25:026:0	Or in case a man has no kinsman , but so recovers his means as to find sufficient for its redemption ,
3:25:027:0	then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it , and so return to his property .
3:25:028:0	But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself , then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee ; but at the jubilee it shall revert , that he may return to his property .
3:25:029:0	‘Likewise , if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city , then his redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale ; his right of redemption lasts a full year .
3:25:030:0	But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations ; it does not revert in the jubilee .
3:25:031:0	The houses of the villages , however , which have no surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields ; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee .
3:25:032:0	As for cities of the Levites , the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession .
3:25:033:0	What , therefore , belongs to the Levites may be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the jubilee , for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel .
3:25:003:1	Of Poor Countrymen
3:25:034:0	But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold , for that is their perpetual possession .
3:25:035:0	‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter , then you are to sustain him , like a stranger or a sojourner , that he may live with you .
3:25:036:0	Do not take usurious interest from him , but revere your God , that your countryman may live with you .
3:25:037:0	You shall not give him your silver at interest , nor your food for gain .
3:25:038:0	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God .
3:25:039:0	‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you , you shall not subject him to a slave’s service .
3:25:040:0	He shall be with you as a hired man , as if he were a sojourner ; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee .
3:25:041:0	He shall then go out from you , he and his sons with him , and shall go back to his family , that he may return to the property of his forefathers .
3:25:042:0	For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt ; they are not to be sold in a slave sale .
3:25:043:0	You shall not rule over him with severity , but are to revere your God .
3:25:044:0	As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you .
3:25:045:0	Then , too , it is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you may gain acquisition , and out of their families who are with you , whom they will have produced in your land ; they also may become your possession .
3:25:004:1	Of Redeeming a Poor Man
3:25:046:0	You may even bequeath them to your sons after you , to receive as a possession ; you can use them as permanent slaves . But in respect to your countrymen , the sons of Israel , you shall not rule with severity over one another .
3:25:047:0	‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes sufficient , and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you , or to the descendants of a stranger’s family ,
3:25:048:0	then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold . One of his brothers may redeem him ,
3:25:049:0	or his uncle , or his uncle’s son , may redeem him , or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him ; or if he prospers , he may redeem himself .
3:25:050:0	He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee ; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years . It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be with him .
3:25:051:0	If there are still many years , he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption ;
3:25:052:0	and if few years remain until the year of jubilee , he shall so calculate with him . In proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption .
3:25:053:0	Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him ; he shall not rule over him with severity in your sight .
3:25:054:0	Even if he is not redeemed by these means , he shall still go out in the year of jubilee , he and his sons with him .
3:25:055:0	For the sons of Israel are My servants ; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt . I am the Lord your God .
