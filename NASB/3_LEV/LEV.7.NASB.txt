3:7:001:1	The Priest’s Part in the Offerings
3:7:001:0	‘Now this is the law of the guilt offering ; it is most holy .
3:7:002:0	In the place where they slay the burnt offering they are to slay the guilt offering , and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar .
3:7:003:0	Then he shall offer from it all its fat : the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails ,
3:7:004:0	and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them , which is on the loins , and the lobe on the liver he shall remove with the kidneys .
3:7:005:0	The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the Lord ; it is a guilt offering .
3:7:006:0	Every male among the priests may eat of it . It shall be eaten in a holy place ; it is most holy .
3:7:007:0	The guilt offering is like the sin offering , there is one law for them ; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it .
3:7:008:0	Also the priest who presents any man’s burnt offering , that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has presented .
3:7:009:0	Likewise , every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it .
3:7:010:0	Every grain offering , mixed with oil or dry , shall belong to all the sons of Aaron , to all alike .
3:7:011:0	‘Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be presented to the Lord .
3:7:012:0	If he offers it by way of thanksgiving , then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil , and unleavened wafers spread with oil , and cakes of well stirred fine flour mixed with oil .
3:7:013:0	With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving , he shall present his offering with cakes of leavened bread .
3:7:014:0	Of this he shall present one of every offering as a contribution to the Lord ; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings .
3:7:015:0	‘Now as for the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings , it shall be eaten on the day of his offering ; he shall not leave any of it over until morning .
3:7:016:0	But if the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering , it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice , and on the next day what is left of it may be eaten ;
3:7:017:0	but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire .
3:7:018:0	So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings should ever be eaten on the third day , he who offers it will not be accepted , and it will not be reckoned to his benefit . It shall be an offensive thing , and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity .
3:7:019:0	‘Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten ; it shall be burned with fire . As for other flesh , anyone who is clean may eat such flesh .
3:7:020:0	But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the Lord , in his uncleanness , that person shall be cut off from his people .
3:7:021:0	When anyone touches anything unclean , whether human uncleanness , or an unclean animal , or any unclean detestable thing , and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the Lord , that person shall be cut off from his people . ’ ”
3:7:022:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:7:023:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel , saying , ‘You shall not eat any fat from an ox , a sheep or a goat .
3:7:024:0	Also the fat of an animal which dies and the fat of an animal torn by beasts may be put to any other use , but you must certainly not eat it .
3:7:025:0	For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is offered to the Lord , even the person who eats shall be cut off from his people .
3:7:026:0	You are not to eat any blood , either of bird or animal , in any of your dwellings .
3:7:027:0	Any person who eats any blood , even that person shall be cut off from his people . ’ ”
3:7:028:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:7:029:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel , saying , ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the Lord shall bring his offering to the Lord from the sacrifice of his peace offerings .
3:7:030:0	His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to the Lord . He shall bring the fat with the breast , that the breast may be presented as a wave offering before the Lord .
3:7:031:0	The priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar , but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons .
3:7:032:0	You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
3:7:033:0	The one among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat , the right thigh shall be his as his portion .
3:7:034:0	For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their due forever from the sons of Israel .
3:7:035:0	‘This is that which is consecrated to Aaron and that which is consecrated to his sons from the offerings by fire to the Lord , in that day when he presented them to serve as priests to the Lord .
3:7:036:0	These the Lord had commanded to be given them from the sons of Israel in the day that He anointed them . It is their due forever throughout their generations . ’ ”
3:7:037:0	This is the law of the burnt offering , the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings ,
3:7:038:0	which the Lord commanded Moses at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to present their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai .
