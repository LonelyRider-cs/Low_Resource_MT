3:6:001:1	Guilt Offering
3:6:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:6:002:0	“ When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against the Lord , and deceives his companion in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted to him , or through robbery , or if he has extorted from his companion ,
3:6:003:0	or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely , so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do ;
3:6:004:0	then it shall be , when he sins and becomes guilty , that he shall restore what he took by robbery or what he got by extortion , or the deposit which was entrusted to him or the lost thing which he found ,
3:6:005:0	or anything about which he swore falsely ; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more . He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering .
3:6:006:0	Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the Lord , a ram without defect from the flock , according to your valuation , for a guilt offering ,
3:6:002:1	The Priest’s Part in the Offerings
3:6:007:0	and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord , and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt . ”
3:6:008:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:6:009:0	“ Command Aaron and his sons , saying , ‘This is the law for the burnt offering : the burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning , and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning on it .
3:6:010:0	The priest is to put on his linen robe , and he shall put on undergarments next to his flesh ; and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire reduces the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar .
3:6:011:0	Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments , and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place .
3:6:012:0	The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it . It shall not go out , but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning ; and he shall lay out the burnt offering on it , and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it .
3:6:013:0	Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar ; it is not to go out .
3:6:014:0	‘Now this is the law of the grain offering : the sons of Aaron shall present it before the Lord in front of the altar .
3:6:015:0	Then one of them shall lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering , with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering , and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar , a soothing aroma , as its memorial offering to the Lord .
3:6:016:0	What is left of it Aaron and his sons are to eat . It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place ; they are to eat it in the court of the tent of meeting .
3:6:017:0	It shall not be baked with leaven . I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire ; it is most holy , like the sin offering and the guilt offering .
3:6:018:0	Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it ; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations , from the offerings by fire to the Lord . Whoever touches them will become consecrated . ’ ”
3:6:019:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:6:020:0	“ This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the Lord on the day when he is anointed ; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering , half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening .
3:6:021:0	It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle . When it is well stirred , you shall bring it . You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to the Lord .
3:6:022:0	The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons shall offer it . By a permanent ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the Lord .
3:6:023:0	So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely . It shall not be eaten . ”
3:6:024:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:6:025:0	“ Speak to Aaron and to his sons , saying , ‘This is the law of the sin offering : in the place where the burnt offering is slain the sin offering shall be slain before the Lord ; it is most holy .
3:6:026:0	The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it . It shall be eaten in a holy place , in the court of the tent of meeting .
3:6:027:0	Anyone who touches its flesh will become consecrated ; and when any of its blood splashes on a garment , in a holy place you shall wash what was splashed on .
3:6:028:0	Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken ; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel , then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water .
3:6:029:0	Every male among the priests may eat of it ; it is most holy .
3:6:030:0	But no sin offering of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place shall be eaten ; it shall be burned with fire .
