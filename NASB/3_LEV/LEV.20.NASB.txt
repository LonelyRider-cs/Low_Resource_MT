3:20:001:1	On Human Sacrifice and Immoralities
3:20:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:20:002:0	“ You shall also say to the sons of Israel : ‘Any man from the sons of Israel or from the aliens sojourning in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech , shall surely be put to death ; the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
3:20:003:0	I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people , because he has given some of his offspring to Molech , so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name .
3:20:004:0	If the people of the land , however , should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech , so as not to put him to death ,
3:20:005:0	then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family , and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him , by playing the harlot after Molech .
3:20:006:0	‘As for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists , to play the harlot after them , I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people .
3:20:007:0	You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy , for I am the Lord your God .
3:20:008:0	You shall keep My statutes and practice them ; I am the Lord who sanctifies you .
3:20:009:0	‘If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother , he shall surely be put to death ; he has cursed his father or his mother , his bloodguiltiness is upon him .
3:20:010:0	‘If there is a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife , one who commits adultery with his friend’s wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
3:20:011:0	If there is a man who lies with his father’s wife , he has uncovered his father’s nakedness ; both of them shall surely be put to death , their bloodguiltiness is upon them .
3:20:012:0	If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law , both of them shall surely be put to death ; they have committed incest , their bloodguiltiness is upon them .
3:20:013:0	If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman , both of them have committed a detestable act ; they shall surely be put to death . Their bloodguiltiness is upon them .
3:20:014:0	If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother , it is immorality ; both he and they shall be burned with fire , so that there will be no immorality in your midst .
3:20:015:0	If there is a man who lies with an animal , he shall surely be put to death ; you shall also kill the animal .
3:20:016:0	If there is a woman who approaches any animal to mate with it , you shall kill the woman and the animal ; they shall surely be put to death . Their bloodguiltiness is upon them .
3:20:017:0	‘If there is a man who takes his sister , his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter , so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness , it is a disgrace ; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people . He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness ; he bears his guilt .
3:20:018:0	If there is a man who lies with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness , he has laid bare her flow , and she has exposed the flow of her blood ; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
3:20:019:0	You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister , for such a one has made naked his blood relative ; they will bear their guilt .
3:20:020:0	If there is a man who lies with his uncle’s wife he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness ; they will bear their sin . They will die childless .
3:20:021:0	If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife , it is abhorrent ; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness . They will be childless .
3:20:022:0	‘You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them , so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out .
3:20:023:0	Moreover , you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I will drive out before you , for they did all these things , and therefore I have abhorred them .
3:20:024:0	Hence I have said to you , “ You are to possess their land , and I Myself will give it to you to possess it , a land flowing with milk and honey . ” I am the Lord your God , who has separated you from the peoples .
3:20:025:0	You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean , and between the unclean bird and the clean ; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground , which I have separated for you as unclean .
3:20:026:0	Thus you are to be holy to Me , for I the Lord am holy ; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine .
3:20:027:0	‘Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death . They shall be stoned with stones , their bloodguiltiness is upon them . ’ ”
