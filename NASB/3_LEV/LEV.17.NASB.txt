3:17:001:1	Blood for Atonement
3:17:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:17:002:0	“ Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘This is what the Lord has commanded , saying ,
3:17:003:0	“ Any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp , or who slaughters it outside the camp ,
3:17:004:0	and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord , bloodguiltiness is to be reckoned to that man . He has shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people .
3:17:005:0	The reason is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing in the open field , that they may bring them in to the Lord , at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest , and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the Lord .
3:17:006:0	The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting , and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to the Lord .
3:17:007:0	They shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot . This shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations . ” ’
3:17:008:0	“ Then you shall say to them , ‘Any man from the house of Israel , or from the aliens who sojourn among them , who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice ,
3:17:009:0	and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it to the Lord , that man also shall be cut off from his people .
3:17:010:0	‘And any man from the house of Israel , or from the aliens who sojourn among them , who eats any blood , I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people .
3:17:011:0	For the life of the flesh is in the blood , and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement . ’
3:17:012:0	Therefore I said to the sons of Israel , ‘No person among you may eat blood , nor may any alien who sojourns among you eat blood . ’
3:17:013:0	So when any man from the sons of Israel , or from the aliens who sojourn among them , in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten , he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth .
3:17:014:0	“ For as for the life of all flesh , its blood is identified with its life . Therefore I said to the sons of Israel , ‘You are not to eat the blood of any flesh , for the life of all flesh is its blood ; whoever eats it shall be cut off . ’
3:17:015:0	When any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts , whether he is a native or an alien , he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water , and remain unclean until evening ; then he will become clean .
3:17:016:0	But if he does not wash them or bathe his body , then he shall bear his guilt . ”
