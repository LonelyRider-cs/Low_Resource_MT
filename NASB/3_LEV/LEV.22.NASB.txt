3:22:001:1	Sundry Rules for Priests
3:22:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:22:002:0	“ Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy gifts of the sons of Israel , which they dedicate to Me , so as not to profane My holy name ; I am the Lord .
3:22:003:0	Say to them , ‘If any man among all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy gifts which the sons of Israel dedicate to the Lord , while he has an uncleanness , that person shall be cut off from before Me ; I am the Lord .
3:22:004:0	No man of the descendants of Aaron , who is a leper or who has a discharge , may eat of the holy gifts until he is clean . And if one touches anything made unclean by a corpse or if a man has a seminal emission ,
3:22:005:0	or if a man touches any teeming things by which he is made unclean , or any man by whom he is made unclean , whatever his uncleanness ;
3:22:006:0	a person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening , and shall not eat of the holy gifts unless he has bathed his body in water .
3:22:007:0	But when the sun sets , he will be clean , and afterward he shall eat of the holy gifts , for it is his food .
3:22:008:0	He shall not eat an animal which dies or is torn by beasts , becoming unclean by it ; I am the Lord .
3:22:009:0	They shall therefore keep My charge , so that they will not bear sin because of it and die thereby because they profane it ; I am the Lord who sanctifies them .
3:22:010:0	‘No layman , however , is to eat the holy gift ; a sojourner with the priest or a hired man shall not eat of the holy gift .
3:22:011:0	But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money , that one may eat of it , and those who are born in his house may eat of his food .
3:22:012:0	If a priest’s daughter is married to a layman , she shall not eat of the offering of the gifts .
3:22:013:0	But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or divorced , and has no child and returns to her father’s house as in her youth , she shall eat of her father’s food ; but no layman shall eat of it .
3:22:014:0	But if a man eats a holy gift unintentionally , then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy gift to the priest .
3:22:015:0	They shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel which they offer to the Lord ,
3:22:002:1	Flawless Animals for Sacrifice
3:22:016:0	and so cause them to bear punishment for guilt by eating their holy gifts ; for I am the Lord who sanctifies them . ’ ”
3:22:017:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:22:018:0	“ Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘Any man of the house of Israel or of the aliens in Israel who presents his offering , whether it is any of their votive or any of their freewill offerings , which they present to the Lord for a burnt offering—
3:22:019:0	for you to be accepted—it must be a male without defect from the cattle , the sheep , or the goats .
3:22:020:0	Whatever has a defect , you shall not offer , for it will not be accepted for you .
3:22:021:0	When a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord to fulfill a special vow or for a freewill offering , of the herd or of the flock , it must be perfect to be accepted ; there shall be no defect in it .
3:22:022:0	Those that are blind or fractured or maimed or having a running sore or eczema or scabs , you shall not offer to the Lord , nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to the Lord .
3:22:023:0	In respect to an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member , you may present it for a freewill offering , but for a vow it will not be accepted .
3:22:024:0	Also anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut , you shall not offer to the Lord , or sacrifice in your land ,
3:22:025:0	nor shall you accept any such from the hand of a foreigner for offering as the food of your God ; for their corruption is in them , they have a defect , they shall not be accepted for you . ’ ”
3:22:026:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:22:027:0	“ When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born , it shall remain seven days with its mother , and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the Lord .
3:22:028:0	But , whether it is an ox or a sheep , you shall not kill both it and its young in one day .
3:22:029:0	When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord , you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted .
3:22:030:0	It shall be eaten on the same day , you shall leave none of it until morning ; I am the Lord .
3:22:031:0	So you shall keep My commandments , and do them ; I am the Lord .
3:22:032:0	“ You shall not profane My holy name , but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel ; I am the Lord who sanctifies you ,
3:22:033:0	who brought you out from the land of Egypt , to be your God ; I am the Lord . ”
