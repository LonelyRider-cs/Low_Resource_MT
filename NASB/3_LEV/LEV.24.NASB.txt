3:24:001:1	The Lamp and the Bread of the Sanctuary
3:24:001:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:24:002:0	“ Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light , to make a lamp burn continually .
3:24:003:0	Outside the veil of testimony in the tent of meeting , Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the Lord continually ; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations .
3:24:004:0	He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord continually .
3:24:005:0	“ Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it ; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake .
3:24:006:0	You shall set them in two rows , six to a row , on the pure gold table before the Lord .
3:24:007:0	You shall put pure frankincense on each row that it may be a memorial portion for the bread , even an offering by fire to the Lord .
3:24:008:0	Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the Lord continually ; it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel .
3:24:009:0	It shall be for Aaron and his sons , and they shall eat it in a holy place ; for it is most holy to him from the Lord’s offerings by fire , his portion forever . ”
3:24:010:0	Now the son of an Israelite woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the sons of Israel ; and the Israelite woman’s son and a man of Israel struggled with each other in the camp .
3:24:011:0	The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed . So they brought him to Moses . ( Now his mother’s name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan . )
3:24:012:0	They put him in custody so that the command of the Lord might be made clear to them .
3:24:013:0	Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:24:014:0	“ Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp , and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head ; then let all the congregation stone him .
3:24:015:0	You shall speak to the sons of Israel , saying , ‘If anyone curses his God , then he will bear his sin .
3:24:002:1	“ An Eye for an Eye ”
3:24:016:0	Moreover , the one who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death ; all the congregation shall certainly stone him . The alien as well as the native , when he blasphemes the Name , shall be put to death .
3:24:017:0	‘If a man takes the life of any human being , he shall surely be put to death .
3:24:018:0	The one who takes the life of an animal shall make it good , life for life .
3:24:019:0	If a man injures his neighbor , just as he has done , so it shall be done to him :
3:24:020:0	fracture for fracture , eye for eye , tooth for tooth ; just as he has injured a man , so it shall be inflicted on him .
3:24:021:0	Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good , but the one who kills a man shall be put to death .
3:24:022:0	There shall be one standard for you ; it shall be for the stranger as well as the native , for I am the Lord your God . ’ ”
3:24:023:0	Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel , and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones . Thus the sons of Israel did , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
