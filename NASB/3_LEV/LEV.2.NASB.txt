3:2:001:1	The Law of Grain Offerings
3:2:001:0	‘Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an offering to the Lord , his offering shall be of fine flour , and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it .
3:2:002:0	He shall then bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests ; and shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all of its frankincense . And the priest shall offer it up in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar , an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the Lord .
3:2:003:0	The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons : a thing most holy , of the offerings to the Lord by fire .
3:2:004:0	‘Now when you bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven , it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil , or unleavened wafers spread with oil .
3:2:005:0	If your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle , it shall be of fine flour , unleavened , mixed with oil ;
3:2:006:0	you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it ; it is a grain offering .
3:2:007:0	Now if your offering is a grain offering made in a pan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
3:2:008:0	When you bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to the Lord , it shall be presented to the priest and he shall bring it to the altar .
3:2:009:0	The priest then shall take up from the grain offering its memorial portion , and shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the Lord .
3:2:010:0	The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons : a thing most holy of the offerings to the Lord by fire .
3:2:011:0	‘No grain offering , which you bring to the Lord , shall be made with leaven , for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to the Lord .
3:2:012:0	As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to the Lord , but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar .
3:2:013:0	Every grain offering of yours , moreover , you shall season with salt , so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be lacking from your grain offering ; with all your offerings you shall offer salt .
3:2:014:0	‘Also if you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the Lord , you shall bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire , grits of new growth , for the grain offering of your early ripened things .
3:2:015:0	You shall then put oil on it and lay incense on it ; it is a grain offering .
3:2:016:0	The priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion , part of its grits and its oil with all its incense as an offering by fire to the Lord .
