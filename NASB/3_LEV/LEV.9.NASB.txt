3:9:001:1	Aaron Offers Sacrifices
3:9:001:0	Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel ;
3:9:002:0	and he said to Aaron , “ Take for yourself a calf , a bull , for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering , both without defect , and offer them before the Lord .
3:9:003:0	Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak , saying , ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering , and a calf and a lamb , both one year old , without defect , for a burnt offering ,
3:9:004:0	and an ox and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before the Lord , and a grain offering mixed with oil ; for today the Lord will appear to you . ’ ”
3:9:005:0	So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting , and the whole congregation came near and stood before the Lord .
3:9:006:0	Moses said , “ This is the thing which the Lord has commanded you to do , that the glory of the Lord may appear to you . ”
3:9:007:0	Moses then said to Aaron , “ Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering , that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people ; then make the offering for the people , that you may make atonement for them , just as the Lord has commanded . ”
3:9:008:0	So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself .
3:9:009:0	Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him ; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put some on the horns of the altar , and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar .
3:9:010:0	The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering , he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:9:011:0	The flesh and the skin , however , he burned with fire outside the camp .
3:9:012:0	Then he slaughtered the burnt offering ; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar .
3:9:013:0	They handed the burnt offering to him in pieces , with the head , and he offered them up in smoke on the altar .
3:9:014:0	He also washed the entrails and the legs , and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar .
3:9:015:0	Then he presented the people’s offering , and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people , and slaughtered it and offered it for sin , like the first .
3:9:016:0	He also presented the burnt offering , and offered it according to the ordinance .
3:9:017:0	Next he presented the grain offering , and filled his hand with some of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar , besides the burnt offering of the morning .
3:9:018:0	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram , the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people ; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar .
3:9:019:0	As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram , the fat tail , and the fat covering , and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver ,
3:9:020:0	they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts ; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar .
3:9:021:0	But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the Lord , just as Moses had commanded .
3:9:022:0	Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them , and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings .
3:9:023:0	Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting . When they came out and blessed the people , the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people .
3:9:024:0	Then fire came out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar ; and when all the people saw it , they shouted and fell on their faces .
