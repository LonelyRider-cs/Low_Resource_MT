3:18:022:0	You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female ; it is an abomination .
3:18:023:0	Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it , nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it ; it is a perversion .
3:18:024:0	‘Do not defile yourselves by any of these things ; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled .
3:18:025:0	For the land has become defiled , therefore I have brought its punishment upon it , so the land has spewed out its inhabitants .
3:18:026:0	But as for you , you are to keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations , neither the native , nor the alien who sojourns among you
3:18:027:0	( for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations , and the land has become defiled ) ;
3:18:028:0	so that the land will not spew you out , should you defile it , as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you .
3:18:029:0	For whoever does any of these abominations , those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people .
3:18:030:0	Thus you are to keep My charge , that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you , so as not to defile yourselves with them ; I am the Lord your God . ’ ”
