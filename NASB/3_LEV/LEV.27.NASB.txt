3:27:001:1	Rules concerning Valuations
3:27:001:0	Again , the Lord spoke to Moses , saying ,
3:27:002:0	“ Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them , ‘When a man makes a difficult vow , he shall be valued according to your valuation of persons belonging to the Lord .
3:27:003:0	If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old , then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
3:27:004:0	Or if it is a female , then your valuation shall be thirty shekels .
3:27:005:0	If it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels .
3:27:006:0	But if they are from a month even up to five years old , then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male , and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver .
3:27:007:0	If they are from sixty years old and upward , if it is a male , then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
3:27:008:0	But if he is poorer than your valuation , then he shall be placed before the priest and the priest shall value him ; according to the means of the one who vowed , the priest shall value him .
3:27:009:0	‘Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the Lord , any such that one gives to the Lord shall be holy .
3:27:010:0	He shall not replace it or exchange it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good ; or if he does exchange animal for animal , then both it and its substitute shall become holy .
3:27:011:0	If , however , it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the Lord , then he shall place the animal before the priest .
3:27:012:0	The priest shall value it as either good or bad ; as you , the priest , value it , so it shall be .
3:27:013:0	But if he should ever wish to redeem it , then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation .
3:27:014:0	‘Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the Lord , then the priest shall value it as either good or bad ; as the priest values it , so it shall stand .
3:27:015:0	Yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house , then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it , so that it may be his .
3:27:016:0	‘Again , if a man consecrates to the Lord part of the fields of his own property , then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it : a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver .
3:27:017:0	If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee , according to your valuation it shall stand .
3:27:018:0	If he consecrates his field after the jubilee , however , then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee ; and it shall be deducted from your valuation .
3:27:019:0	If the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field , then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it , so that it may pass to him .
3:27:020:0	Yet if he will not redeem the field , but has sold the field to another man , it may no longer be redeemed ;
3:27:021:0	and when it reverts in the jubilee , the field shall be holy to the Lord , like a field set apart ; it shall be for the priest as his property .
3:27:022:0	Or if he consecrates to the Lord a field which he has bought , which is not a part of the field of his own property ,
3:27:023:0	then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee ; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the Lord .
3:27:024:0	In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it , to whom the possession of the land belongs .
3:27:025:0	Every valuation of yours , moreover , shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary . The shekel shall be twenty gerahs .
3:27:026:0	‘However , a firstborn among animals , which as a firstborn belongs to the Lord , no man may consecrate it ; whether ox or sheep , it is the Lord’s .
3:27:027:0	But if it is among the unclean animals , then he shall redeem it according to your valuation and add to it one-fifth of it ; and if it is not redeemed , then it shall be sold according to your valuation .
3:27:028:0	‘Nevertheless , anything which a man sets apart to the Lord out of all that he has , of man or animal or of the fields of his own property , shall not be sold or redeemed . Anything devoted to destruction is most holy to the Lord .
3:27:029:0	No one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed ; he shall surely be put to death .
3:27:030:0	‘Thus all the tithe of the land , of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree , is the Lord’s ; it is holy to the Lord .
3:27:031:0	If , therefore , a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe , he shall add to it one-fifth of it .
3:27:032:0	For every tenth part of herd or flock , whatever passes under the rod , the tenth one shall be holy to the Lord .
3:27:033:0	He is not to be concerned whether it is good or bad , nor shall he exchange it ; or if he does exchange it , then both it and its substitute shall become holy . It shall not be redeemed . ’ ”
3:27:034:0	These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai .
