3:10:001:1	The Sin of Nadab and Abihu
3:10:001:0	Now Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , took their respective firepans , and after putting fire in them , placed incense on it and offered strange fire before the Lord , which He had not commanded them .
3:10:002:0	And fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them , and they died before the Lord .
3:10:003:0	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ It is what the Lord spoke , saying , ‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy , And before all the people I will be honored . ’ ” So Aaron , therefore , kept silent .
3:10:004:0	Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel , and said to them , “ Come forward , carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp . ”
3:10:005:0	So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp , as Moses had said .
3:10:006:0	Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes , so that you will not die and that He will not become wrathful against all the congregation . But your kinsmen , the whole house of Israel , shall bewail the burning which the Lord has brought about .
3:10:007:0	You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting , or you will die ; for the Lord’s anointing oil is upon you . ” So they did according to the word of Moses .
3:10:008:0	The Lord then spoke to Aaron , saying ,
3:10:009:0	“ Do not drink wine or strong drink , neither you nor your sons with you , when you come into the tent of meeting , so that you will not die—it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations—
3:10:010:0	and so as to make a distinction between the holy and the profane , and between the unclean and the clean ,
3:10:011:0	and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the Lord has spoken to them through Moses . ”
3:10:012:0	Then Moses spoke to Aaron , and to his surviving sons , Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Take the grain offering that is left over from the Lord’s offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar , for it is most holy .
3:10:013:0	You shall eat it , moreover , in a holy place , because it is your due and your sons’ due out of the Lord’s offerings by fire ; for thus I have been commanded .
3:10:014:0	The breast of the wave offering , however , and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place , you and your sons and your daughters with you ; for they have been given as your due and your sons’ due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel .
3:10:015:0	The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat , to present as a wave offering before the Lord ; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you , just as the Lord has commanded . ”
3:10:016:0	But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering , and behold , it had been burned up ! So he was angry with Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar , saying ,
3:10:017:0	“ Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place ? For it is most holy , and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the Lord .
3:10:018:0	Behold , since its blood had not been brought inside , into the sanctuary , you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary , just as I commanded . ”
3:10:019:0	But Aaron spoke to Moses , “ Behold , this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord . When things like these happened to me , if I had eaten a sin offering today , would it have been good in the sight of the Lord ? ”
3:10:020:0	When Moses heard that , it seemed good in his sight .
