3:26:001:1	Blessings of Obedience
3:26:001:0	‘You shall not make for yourselves idols , nor shall you set up for yourselves an image or a sacred pillar , nor shall you place a figured stone in your land to bow down to it ; for I am the Lord your God .
3:26:002:0	You shall keep My sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary ; I am the Lord .
3:26:003:0	If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them out ,
3:26:004:0	then I shall give you rains in their season , so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit .
3:26:005:0	Indeed , your threshing will last for you until grape gathering , and grape gathering will last until sowing time . You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land .
3:26:006:0	I shall also grant peace in the land , so that you may lie down with no one making you tremble . I shall also eliminate harmful beasts from the land , and no sword will pass through your land .
3:26:007:0	But you will chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword ;
3:26:008:0	five of you will chase a hundred , and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand , and your enemies will fall before you by the sword .
3:26:009:0	So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you , and I will confirm My covenant with you .
3:26:010:0	You will eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new .
3:26:011:0	Moreover , I will make My dwelling among you , and My soul will not reject you .
3:26:012:0	I will also walk among you and be your God , and you shall be My people .
3:26:002:1	Penalties of Disobedience
3:26:013:0	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be their slaves , and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect .
3:26:014:0	‘But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these commandments ,
3:26:015:0	if , instead , you reject My statutes , and if your soul abhors My ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments , and so break My covenant ,
3:26:016:0	I , in turn , will do this to you : I will appoint over you a sudden terror , consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away ; also , you will sow your seed uselessly , for your enemies will eat it up .
3:26:017:0	I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies ; and those who hate you will rule over you , and you will flee when no one is pursuing you .
3:26:018:0	If also after these things you do not obey Me , then I will punish you seven times more for your sins .
3:26:019:0	I will also break down your pride of power ; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze .
3:26:020:0	Your strength will be spent uselessly , for your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit .
3:26:021:0	‘If then , you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling to obey Me , I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins .
3:26:022:0	I will let loose among you the beasts of the field , which will bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that your roads lie deserted .
3:26:023:0	‘And if by these things you are not turned to Me , but act with hostility against Me ,
3:26:024:0	then I will act with hostility against you ; and I , even I , will strike you seven times for your sins .
3:26:025:0	I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant ; and when you gather together into your cities , I will send pestilence among you , so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands .
3:26:026:0	When I break your staff of bread , ten women will bake your bread in one oven , and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts , so that you will eat and not be satisfied .
3:26:027:0	‘Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me , but act with hostility against Me ,
3:26:028:0	then I will act with wrathful hostility against you , and I , even I , will punish you seven times for your sins .
3:26:029:0	Further , you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters you will eat .
3:26:030:0	I then will destroy your high places , and cut down your incense altars , and heap your remains on the remains of your idols , for My soul shall abhor you .
3:26:031:0	I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your sanctuaries desolate , and I will not smell your soothing aromas .
3:26:032:0	I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over it .
3:26:033:0	You , however , I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you , as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste .
3:26:034:0	‘Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation , while you are in your enemies’ land ; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths .
3:26:035:0	All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths , while you were living on it .
3:26:036:0	As for those of you who may be left , I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies . And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them , and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the sword , and they will fall .
3:26:037:0	They will therefore stumble over each other as if running from the sword , although no one is pursuing ; and you will have no strength to stand up before your enemies .
3:26:038:0	But you will perish among the nations , and your enemies’ land will consume you .
3:26:039:0	So those of you who may be left will rot away because of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies ; and also because of the iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them .
3:26:040:0	‘If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their forefathers , in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me , and also in their acting with hostility against Me—
3:26:041:0	I also was acting with hostility against them , to bring them into the land of their enemies—or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity ,
3:26:042:0	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob , and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac , and My covenant with Abraham as well , and I will remember the land .
3:26:043:0	For the land will be abandoned by them , and will make up for its sabbaths while it is made desolate without them . They , meanwhile , will be making amends for their iniquity , because they rejected My ordinances and their soul abhorred My statutes .
3:26:044:0	Yet in spite of this , when they are in the land of their enemies , I will not reject them , nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them , breaking My covenant with them ; for I am the Lord their God .
3:26:045:0	But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors , whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations , that I might be their God . I am the Lord . ’ ”
3:26:046:0	These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the Lord established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai .
