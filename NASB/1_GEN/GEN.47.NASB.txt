1:47:001:1	Jacob’s Family Settles in Goshen
1:47:001:0	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh , and said , “ My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have , have come out of the land of Canaan ; and behold , they are in the land of Goshen . ”
1:47:002:0	He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh .
1:47:003:0	Then Pharaoh said to his brothers , “ What is your occupation ? ” So they said to Pharaoh , “ Your servants are shepherds , both we and our fathers . ”
1:47:004:0	They said to Pharaoh , “ We have come to sojourn in the land , for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks , for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan . Now , therefore , please let your servants live in the land of Goshen . ”
1:47:005:0	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Your father and your brothers have come to you .
1:47:006:0	The land of Egypt is at your disposal ; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land , let them live in the land of Goshen ; and if you know any capable men among them , then put them in charge of my livestock . ”
1:47:007:0	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh ; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
1:47:008:0	Pharaoh said to Jacob , “ How many years have you lived ? ”
1:47:009:0	So Jacob said to Pharaoh , “ The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty ; few and unpleasant have been the years of my life , nor have they attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning . ”
1:47:010:0	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from his presence .
1:47:011:0	So Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had ordered .
1:47:012:0	Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food , according to their little ones .
1:47:013:0	Now there was no food in all the land , because the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine .
1:47:014:0	Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought , and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house .
1:47:015:0	When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said , “ Give us food , for why should we die in your presence ? For our money is gone . ”
1:47:016:0	Then Joseph said , “ Give up your livestock , and I will give you food for your livestock , since your money is gone . ”
1:47:017:0	So they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys ; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year .
1:47:018:0	When that year was ended , they came to him the next year and said to him , “ We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent , and the cattle are my lord’s . There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our lands .
1:47:002:1	Result of the Famine
1:47:019:0	Why should we die before your eyes , both we and our land ? Buy us and our land for food , and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh . So give us seed , that we may live and not die , and that the land may not be desolate . ”
1:47:020:0	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh , for every Egyptian sold his field , because the famine was severe upon them . Thus the land became Pharaoh’s .
1:47:021:0	As for the people , he removed them to the cities from one end of Egypt’s border to the other .
1:47:022:0	Only the land of the priests he did not buy , for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh , and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them . Therefore , they did not sell their land .
1:47:023:0	Then Joseph said to the people , “ Behold , I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh ; now , here is seed for you , and you may sow the land .
1:47:024:0	At the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh , and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones . ”
1:47:025:0	So they said , “ You have saved our lives ! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh’s slaves . ”
1:47:026:0	Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt valid to this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth ; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s .
1:47:027:0	Now Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in Goshen , and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous .
1:47:028:0	Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years ; so the length of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years .
1:47:029:0	When the time for Israel to die drew near , he called his son Joseph and said to him , “ Please , if I have found favor in your sight , place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and faithfulness . Please do not bury me in Egypt ,
1:47:030:0	but when I lie down with my fathers , you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place . ” And he said , “ I will do as you have said . ”
1:47:031:0	He said , “ Swear to me . ” So he swore to him . Then Israel bowed in worship at the head of the bed .
