1:36:001:1	Esau Moves
1:36:001:0	Now these are the records of the generations of Esau ( that is , Edom ) .
1:36:002:0	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
1:36:003:0	also Basemath , Ishmael’s daughter , the sister of Nebaioth .
1:36:004:0	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau , and Basemath bore Reuel ,
1:36:005:0	and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah . These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan .
1:36:006:0	Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household , and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Canaan , and went to another land away from his brother Jacob .
1:36:007:0	For their property had become too great for them to live together , and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock .
1:36:002:1	Descendants of Esau
1:36:008:0	So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir ; Esau is Edom .
1:36:009:0	These then are the records of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir .
1:36:010:0	These are the names of Esau’s sons : Eliphaz the son of Esau’s wife Adah , Reuel the son of Esau’s wife Basemath .

1:36:030:0	chief Dishon , chief Ezer , chief Dishan . These are the chiefs descended from the Horites , according to their various chiefs in the land of Seir .
1:36:031:0	Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel .
1:36:032:0	Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom , and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
