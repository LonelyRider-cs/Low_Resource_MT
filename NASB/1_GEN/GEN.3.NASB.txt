1:3:001:1	The Fall of Man
1:3:001:0	Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made . And he said to the woman , “ Indeed , has God said , ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’ ? ”
1:3:002:0	The woman said to the serpent , “ From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat ;
1:3:003:0	but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden , God has said , ‘You shall not eat from it or touch it , or you will die . ’ ”
1:3:004:0	The serpent said to the woman , “ You surely will not die !
1:3:005:0	For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil . ”
1:3:006:0	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a delight to the eyes , and that the tree was desirable to make one wise , she took from its fruit and ate ; and she gave also to her husband with her , and he ate .
1:3:007:0	Then the eyes of both of them were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings .
1:3:008:0	They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden .
1:3:009:0	Then the Lord God called to the man , and said to him , “ Where are you ? ”
1:3:010:0	He said , “ I heard the sound of You in the garden , and I was afraid because I was naked ; so I hid myself . ”
1:3:011:0	And He said , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat ? ”
1:3:012:0	The man said , “ The woman whom You gave to be with me , she gave me from the tree , and I ate . ”
1:3:013:0	Then the Lord God said to the woman , “ What is this you have done ? ” And the woman said , “ The serpent deceived me , and I ate . ”
1:3:014:0	The Lord God said to the serpent , “ Because you have done this , Cursed are you more than all cattle , And more than every beast of the field ; On your belly you will go , And dust you will eatAll the days of your life ;
1:3:015:0	And I will put enmityBetween you and the woman , And between your seed and her seed ; He shall bruise you on the head , And you shall bruise him on the heel . ”
1:3:016:0	To the woman He said , “ I will greatly multiplyYour pain in childbirth , In pain you will bring forth children ; Yet your desire will be for your husband , And he will rule over you . ”
1:3:017:0	Then to Adam He said , “ Because you have listened to the voice of your wife , and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you , saying , ‘You shall not eat from it’ ; Cursed is the ground because of you ; In toil you will eat of itAll the days of your life .
1:3:018:0	Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you ; And you will eat the plants of the field ;
1:3:019:0	By the sweat of your faceYou will eat bread , Till you return to the ground , Because from it you were taken ; For you are dust , And to dust you shall return . ”
1:3:020:0	Now the man called his wife’s name Eve , because she was the mother of all the living .
1:3:021:0	The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife , and clothed them .
1:3:022:0	Then the Lord God said , “ Behold , the man has become like one of Us , knowing good and evil ; and now , he might stretch out his hand , and take also from the tree of life , and eat , and live forever ” —
1:3:023:0	therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden , to cultivate the ground from which he was taken .
1:3:024:0	So He drove the man out ; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life .
