1:6:001:1	The Corruption of Mankind
1:6:001:0	Now it came about , when men began to multiply on the face of the land , and daughters were born to them ,
1:6:002:0	that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful ; and they took wives for themselves , whomever they chose .
1:6:003:0	Then the Lord said , “ My Spirit shall not strive with man forever , because he also is flesh ; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years . ”
1:6:004:0	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days , and also afterward , when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men , and they bore children to them . Those were the mighty men who were of old , men of renown .
1:6:005:0	Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth , and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
1:6:006:0	The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth , and He was grieved in His heart .
1:6:007:0	The Lord said , “ I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land , from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . ”
1:6:008:0	But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord .
1:6:009:0	These are the records of the generations of Noah . Noah was a righteous man , blameless in his time ; Noah walked with God .
1:6:010:0	Noah became the father of three sons : Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
1:6:011:0	Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God , and the earth was filled with violence .
1:6:012:0	God looked on the earth , and behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth .
1:6:013:0	Then God said to Noah , “ The end of all flesh has come before Me ; for the earth is filled with violence because of them ; and behold , I am about to destroy them with the earth .
1:6:014:0	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood ; you shall make the ark with rooms , and shall cover it inside and out with pitch .
1:6:015:0	This is how you shall make it : the length of the ark three hundred cubits , its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits .
1:6:016:0	You shall make a window for the ark , and finish it to a cubit from the top ; and set the door of the ark in the side of it ; you shall make it with lower , second , and third decks .
1:6:017:0	Behold , I , even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth , to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life , from under heaven ; everything that is on the earth shall perish .
1:6:018:0	But I will establish My covenant with you ; and you shall enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife , and your sons’ wives with you .
1:6:019:0	And of every living thing of all flesh , you shall bring two of every kind into the ark , to keep them alive with you ; they shall be male and female .
1:6:020:0	Of the birds after their kind , and of the animals after their kind , of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind , two of every kind will come to you to keep them alive .
1:6:021:0	As for you , take for yourself some of all food which is edible , and gather it to yourself ; and it shall be for food for you and for them . ”
1:6:022:0	Thus Noah did ; according to all that God had commanded him , so he did .
