1:40:001:1	Joseph Interprets a Dream
1:40:001:0	Then it came about after these things , the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord , the king of Egypt .
1:40:002:0	Pharaoh was furious with his two officials , the chief cupbearer and the chief baker .
1:40:003:0	So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard , in the jail , the same place where Joseph was imprisoned .
1:40:004:0	The captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them , and he took care of them ; and they were in confinement for some time .
1:40:005:0	Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt , who were confined in jail , both had a dream the same night , each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation .
1:40:006:0	When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them , behold , they were dejected .
1:40:007:0	He asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in confinement in his master’s house , “ Why are your faces so sad today ? ”
1:40:008:0	Then they said to him , “ We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it . ” Then Joseph said to them , “ Do not interpretations belong to God ? Tell it to me , please . ”
1:40:009:0	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , “ In my dream , behold , there was a vine in front of me ;
1:40:010:0	and on the vine were three branches . And as it was budding , its blossoms came out , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
1:40:011:0	Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand ; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup , and I put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand . ”
1:40:012:0	Then Joseph said to him , “ This is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three days ;
1:40:013:0	within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office ; and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer .
1:40:014:0	Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you , and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house .
1:40:015:0	For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews , and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon . ”
1:40:016:0	When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably , he said to Joseph , “ I also saw in my dream , and behold , there were three baskets of white bread on my head ;
1:40:017:0	and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh , and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head . ”
1:40:018:0	Then Joseph answered and said , “ This is its interpretation : the three baskets are three days ;
1:40:019:0	within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree , and the birds will eat your flesh off you . ”
1:40:020:0	Thus it came about on the third day , which was Pharaoh’s birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants ; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants .
1:40:021:0	He restored the chief cupbearer to his office , and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand ;
1:40:022:0	but he hanged the chief baker , just as Joseph had interpreted to them .
1:40:023:0	Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph , but forgot him .
