1:34:001:1	The Treachery of Jacob’s Sons
1:34:001:0	Now Dinah the daughter of Leah , whom she had borne to Jacob , went out to visit the daughters of the land .
1:34:002:0	When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , the prince of the land , saw her , he took her and lay with her by force .
1:34:003:0	He was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her .
1:34:004:0	So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor , saying , “ Get me this young girl for a wife . ”
1:34:005:0	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter ; but his sons were with his livestock in the field , so Jacob kept silent until they came in .
1:34:006:0	Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him .
1:34:007:0	Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it ; and the men were grieved , and they were very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter , for such a thing ought not to be done .
1:34:008:0	But Hamor spoke with them , saying , “ The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter ; please give her to him in marriage .
1:34:009:0	Intermarry with us ; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves .
1:34:010:0	Thus you shall live with us , and the land shall be open before you ; live and trade in it and acquire property in it . ”
1:34:011:0	Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers , “ If I find favor in your sight , then I will give whatever you say to me .
1:34:012:0	Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift , and I will give according as you say to me ; but give me the girl in marriage . ”
1:34:013:0	But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor with deceit , because he had defiled Dinah their sister .
1:34:014:0	They said to them , “ We cannot do this thing , to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised , for that would be a disgrace to us .
1:34:015:0	Only on this condition will we consent to you : if you will become like us , in that every male of you be circumcised ,
1:34:016:0	then we will give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters for ourselves , and we will live with you and become one people .
1:34:017:0	But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised , then we will take our daughter and go . ”
1:34:018:0	Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem , Hamor’s son .
1:34:019:0	The young man did not delay to do the thing , because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter . Now he was more respected than all the household of his father .
1:34:020:0	So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city , saying ,
1:34:021:0	“ These men are friendly with us ; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it , for behold , the land is large enough for them . Let us take their daughters in marriage , and give our daughters to them .
1:34:022:0	Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people : that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised .
1:34:023:0	Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours ? Only let us consent to them , and they will live with us . ”
1:34:024:0	All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem , and every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
1:34:025:0	Now it came about on the third day , when they were in pain , that two of Jacob’s sons , Simeon and Levi , Dinah’s brothers , each took his sword and came upon the city unawares , and killed every male .
1:34:026:0	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah from Shechem’s house , and went forth .
1:34:027:0	Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and looted the city , because they had defiled their sister .
1:34:028:0	They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys , and that which was in the city and that which was in the field ;
1:34:029:0	and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives , even all that was in the houses .
1:34:030:0	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land , among the Canaanites and the Perizzites ; and my men being few in number , they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be destroyed , I and my household . ”
1:34:031:0	But they said , “ Should he treat our sister as a harlot ? ”
