1:8:001:1	The Flood Subsides
1:8:001:0	But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark ; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth , and the water subsided .
1:8:002:0	Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed , and the rain from the sky was restrained ;
1:8:003:0	and the water receded steadily from the earth , and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased .
1:8:004:0	In the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat .
1:8:005:0	The water decreased steadily until the tenth month ; in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains became visible .
1:8:006:0	Then it came about at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made ;
1:8:007:0	and he sent out a raven , and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth .
1:8:008:0	Then he sent out a dove from him , to see if the water was abated from the face of the land ;
1:8:009:0	but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot , so she returned to him into the ark , for the water was on the surface of all the earth . Then he put out his hand and took her , and brought her into the ark to himself .
1:8:010:0	So he waited yet another seven days ; and again he sent out the dove from the ark .
1:8:011:0	The dove came to him toward evening , and behold , in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf . So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth .
1:8:012:0	Then he waited yet another seven days , and sent out the dove ; but she did not return to him again .
1:8:013:0	Now it came about in the six hundred and first year , in the first month , on the first of the month , the water was dried up from the earth . Then Noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and behold , the surface of the ground was dried up .
1:8:014:0	In the second month , on the twenty-seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
1:8:015:0	Then God spoke to Noah , saying ,
1:8:016:0	“ Go out of the ark , you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you .
1:8:017:0	Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you , birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth , that they may breed abundantly on the earth , and be fruitful and multiply on the earth . ”
1:8:018:0	So Noah went out , and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him .
1:8:019:0	Every beast , every creeping thing , and every bird , everything that moves on the earth , went out by their families from the ark .
1:8:020:0	Then Noah built an altar to the Lord , and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
1:8:021:0	The Lord smelled the soothing aroma ; and the Lord said to Himself , “ I will never again curse the ground on account of man , for the intent of man’s heart is evil from his youth ; and I will never again destroy every living thing , as I have done .
1:8:022:0	While the earth remains , Seedtime and harvest , And cold and heat , And summer and winter , And day and nightShall not cease . ”
