1:18:001:1	Birth of Isaac Promised
1:18:001:0	Now the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre , while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day .
1:18:002:0	When he lifted up his eyes and looked , behold , three men were standing opposite him ; and when he saw them , he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth ,
1:18:003:0	and said , “ My Lord , if now I have found favor in Your sight , please do not pass Your servant by .
1:18:004:0	Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree ;
1:18:005:0	and I will bring a piece of bread , that you may refresh yourselves ; after that you may go on , since you have visited your servant . ” And they said , “ So do , as you have said . ”
1:18:006:0	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah , and said , “ Quickly , prepare three measures of fine flour , knead it and make bread cakes . ”
1:18:007:0	Abraham also ran to the herd , and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant , and he hurried to prepare it .
1:18:008:0	He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared , and placed it before them ; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate .
1:18:009:0	Then they said to him , “ Where is Sarah your wife ? ” And he said , “ There , in the tent . ”
1:18:010:0	He said , “ I will surely return to you at this time next year ; and behold , Sarah your wife will have a son . ” And Sarah was listening at the tent door , which was behind him .
1:18:011:0	Now Abraham and Sarah were old , advanced in age ; Sarah was past childbearing .
1:18:012:0	Sarah laughed to herself , saying , “ After I have become old , shall I have pleasure , my lord being old also ? ”
1:18:013:0	And the Lord said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh , saying , ‘Shall I indeed bear a child , when I am so old ? ’
1:18:014:0	Is anything too difficult for the Lord ? At the appointed time I will return to you , at this time next year , and Sarah will have a son . ”
1:18:015:0	Sarah denied it however , saying , “ I did not laugh ” ; for she was afraid . And He said , “ No , but you did laugh . ”
1:18:016:0	Then the men rose up from there , and looked down toward Sodom ; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off .
1:18:017:0	The Lord said , “ Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do ,
1:18:018:0	since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation , and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed ?
1:18:019:0	For I have chosen him , so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice , so that the Lord may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him . ”
1:18:020:0	And the Lord said , “ The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great , and their sin is exceedingly grave .
1:18:021:0	I will go down now , and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry , which has come to Me ; and if not , I will know . ”
1:18:022:0	Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom , while Abraham was still standing before the Lord .
1:18:023:0	Abraham came near and said , “ Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked ?
1:18:024:0	Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city ; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it ?
1:18:025:0	Far be it from You to do such a thing , to slay the righteous with the wicked , so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike . Far be it from You ! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly ? ”
1:18:026:0	So the Lord said , “ If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare the whole place on their account . ”
1:18:027:0	And Abraham replied , “ Now behold , I have ventured to speak to the Lord , although I am but dust and ashes .
1:18:028:0	Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five , will You destroy the whole city because of five ? ” And He said , “ I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there . ”
1:18:029:0	He spoke to Him yet again and said , “ Suppose forty are found there ? ” And He said , “ I will not do it on account of the forty . ”
1:18:030:0	Then he said , “ Oh may the Lord not be angry , and I shall speak ; suppose thirty are found there ? ” And He said , “ I will not do it if I find thirty there . ”
1:18:031:0	And he said , “ Now behold , I have ventured to speak to the Lord ; suppose twenty are found there ? ” And He said , “ I will not destroy it on account of the twenty . ”
1:18:032:0	Then he said , “ Oh may the Lord not be angry , and I shall speak only this once ; suppose ten are found there ? ” And He said , “ I will not destroy it on account of the ten . ”
1:18:033:0	As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the Lord departed , and Abraham returned to his place .
