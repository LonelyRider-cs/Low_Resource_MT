1:33:001:1	Jacob Meets Esau
1:33:001:0	Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked , and behold , Esau was coming , and four hundred men with him . So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids .
1:33:002:0	He put the maids and their children in front , and Leah and her children next , and Rachel and Joseph last .
1:33:003:0	But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
1:33:004:0	Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him , and fell on his neck and kissed him , and they wept .
1:33:005:0	He lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children , and said , “ Who are these with you ? ” So he said , “ The children whom God has graciously given your servant . ”
1:33:006:0	Then the maids came near with their children , and they bowed down .
1:33:007:0	Leah likewise came near with her children , and they bowed down ; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel , and they bowed down .
1:33:008:0	And he said , “ What do you mean by all this company which I have met ? ” And he said , “ To find favor in the sight of my lord . ”
1:33:009:0	But Esau said , “ I have plenty , my brother ; let what you have be your own . ”
1:33:010:0	Jacob said , “ No , please , if now I have found favor in your sight , then take my present from my hand , for I see your face as one sees the face of God , and you have received me favorably .
1:33:011:0	Please take my gift which has been brought to you , because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have plenty . ” Thus he urged him and he took it .
1:33:012:0	Then Esau said , “ Let us take our journey and go , and I will go before you . ”
1:33:013:0	But he said to him , “ My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me . And if they are driven hard one day , all the flocks will die .
1:33:014:0	Please let my lord pass on before his servant , and I will proceed at my leisure , according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord at Seir . ”
1:33:015:0	Esau said , “ Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me . ” But he said , “ What need is there ? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord . ”
1:33:016:0	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir .
1:33:002:1	Jacob Settles in Shechem
1:33:017:0	Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built for himself a house and made booths for his livestock ; therefore the place is named Succoth .
1:33:018:0	Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan-aram , and camped before the city .
1:33:019:0	He bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor , Shechem’s father , for one hundred pieces of money .
1:33:020:0	Then he erected there an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel .
