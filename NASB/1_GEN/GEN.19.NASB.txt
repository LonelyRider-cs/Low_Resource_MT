1:19:001:1	The Doom of Sodom
1:19:001:0	Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom . When Lot saw them , he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground .
1:19:002:0	And he said , “ Now behold , my lords , please turn aside into your servant’s house , and spend the night , and wash your feet ; then you may rise early and go on your way . ” They said however , “ No , but we shall spend the night in the square . ”
1:19:003:0	Yet he urged them strongly , so they turned aside to him and entered his house ; and he prepared a feast for them , and baked unleavened bread , and they ate .
1:19:004:0	Before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter ;
1:19:005:0	and they called to Lot and said to him , “ Where are the men who came to you tonight ? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them . ”
1:19:006:0	But Lot went out to them at the doorway , and shut the door behind him ,
1:19:007:0	and said , “ Please , my brothers , do not act wickedly .
1:19:008:0	Now behold , I have two daughters who have not had relations with man ; please let me bring them out to you , and do to them whatever you like ; only do nothing to these men , inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof . ”
1:19:009:0	But they said , “ Stand aside . ” Furthermore , they said , “ This one came in as an alien , and already he is acting like a judge ; now we will treat you worse than them . ” So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door .
1:19:010:0	But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them , and shut the door .
1:19:011:0	They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness , both small and great , so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway .
1:19:012:0	Then the two men said to Lot , “ Whom else have you here ? A son-in-law , and your sons , and your daughters , and whomever you have in the city , bring them out of the place ;
1:19:013:0	for we are about to destroy this place , because their outcry has become so great before the Lord that the Lord has sent us to destroy it . ”
1:19:014:0	Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law , who were to marry his daughters , and said , “ Up , get out of this place , for the Lord will destroy the city . ” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting .
1:19:015:0	When morning dawned , the angels urged Lot , saying , “ Up , take your wife and your two daughters who are here , or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city . ”
1:19:016:0	But he hesitated . So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters , for the compassion of the Lord was upon him ; and they brought him out , and put him outside the city .
1:19:017:0	When they had brought them outside , one said , “ Escape for your life ! Do not look behind you , and do not stay anywhere in the valley ; escape to the mountains , or you will be swept away . ”
1:19:018:0	But Lot said to them , “ Oh no , my lords !
1:19:019:0	Now behold , your servant has found favor in your sight , and you have magnified your lovingkindness , which you have shown me by saving my life ; but I cannot escape to the mountains , for the disaster will overtake me and I will die ;
1:19:020:0	now behold , this town is near enough to flee to , and it is small . Please , let me escape there ( is it not small ? ) that my life may be saved . ”
1:19:021:0	He said to him , “ Behold , I grant you this request also , not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken .
1:19:022:0	Hurry , escape there , for I cannot do anything until you arrive there . ” Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar .
1:19:023:0	The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar .
1:19:024:0	Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven ,
1:19:025:0	and He overthrew those cities , and all the valley , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and what grew on the ground .
1:19:026:0	But his wife , from behind him , looked back , and she became a pillar of salt .
1:19:027:0	Now Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the Lord ;
1:19:028:0	and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the valley , and he saw , and behold , the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace .
1:19:002:1	Lot Is Debased
1:19:029:0	Thus it came about , when God destroyed the cities of the valley , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived .
1:19:030:0	Lot went up from Zoar , and stayed in the mountains , and his two daughters with him ; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar ; and he stayed in a cave , he and his two daughters .
1:19:031:0	Then the firstborn said to the younger , “ Our father is old , and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth .
1:19:032:0	Come , let us make our father drink wine , and let us lie with him that we may preserve our family through our father . ”
1:19:033:0	So they made their father drink wine that night , and the firstborn went in and lay with her father ; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose .
1:19:034:0	On the following day , the firstborn said to the younger , “ Behold , I lay last night with my father ; let us make him drink wine tonight also ; then you go in and lie with him , that we may preserve our family through our father . ”
1:19:035:0	So they made their father drink wine that night also , and the younger arose and lay with him ; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose .
1:19:036:0	Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father .
1:19:037:0	The firstborn bore a son , and called his name Moab ; he is the father of the Moabites to this day .
1:19:038:0	As for the younger , she also bore a son , and called his name Ben-ammi ; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day .
