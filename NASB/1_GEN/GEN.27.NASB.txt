1:27:001:1	Jacob’s Deception
1:27:001:0	Now it came about , when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see , that he called his older son Esau and said to him , “ My son . ” And he said to him , “ Here I am . ”
1:27:002:0	Isaac said , “ Behold now , I am old and I do not know the day of my death .
1:27:003:0	Now then , please take your gear , your quiver and your bow , and go out to the field and hunt game for me ;
1:27:004:0	and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love , and bring it to me that I may eat , so that my soul may bless you before I die . ”
1:27:005:0	Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau . So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring home ,
1:27:006:0	Rebekah said to her son Jacob , “ Behold , I heard your father speak to your brother Esau , saying ,
1:27:007:0	‘Bring me some game and prepare a savory dish for me , that I may eat , and bless you in the presence of the Lord before my death . ’
1:27:008:0	Now therefore , my son , listen to me as I command you .
1:27:009:0	Go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there , that I may prepare them as a savory dish for your father , such as he loves .
1:27:010:0	Then you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . ”
1:27:011:0	Jacob answered his mother Rebekah , “ Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man .
1:27:012:0	Perhaps my father will feel me , then I will be as a deceiver in his sight , and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing . ”
1:27:013:0	But his mother said to him , “ Your curse be on me , my son ; only obey my voice , and go , get them for me . ”
1:27:014:0	So he went and got them , and brought them to his mother ; and his mother made savory food such as his father loved .
1:27:015:0	Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob her younger son .
1:27:016:0	And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck .
1:27:017:0	She also gave the savory food and the bread , which she had made , to her son Jacob .
1:27:018:0	Then he came to his father and said , “ My father . ” And he said , “ Here I am . Who are you , my son ? ”
1:27:019:0	Jacob said to his father , “ I am Esau your firstborn ; I have done as you told me . Get up , please , sit and eat of my game , that you may bless me . ”
1:27:020:0	Isaac said to his son , “ How is it that you have it so quickly , my son ? ” And he said , “ Because the Lord your God caused it to happen to me . ”
1:27:021:0	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Please come close , that I may feel you , my son , whether you are really my son Esau or not . ”
1:27:022:0	So Jacob came close to Isaac his father , and he felt him and said , “ The voice is the voice of Jacob , but the hands are the hands of Esau . ”
1:27:023:0	He did not recognize him , because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands ; so he blessed him .
1:27:024:0	And he said , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” And he said , “ I am . ”
1:27:025:0	So he said , “ Bring it to me , and I will eat of my son’s game , that I may bless you . ” And he brought it to him , and he ate ; he also brought him wine and he drank .
1:27:026:0	Then his father Isaac said to him , “ Please come close and kiss me , my son . ”
1:27:027:0	So he came close and kissed him ; and when he smelled the smell of his garments , he blessed him and said , “ See , the smell of my sonIs like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed ;
1:27:028:0	Now may God give you of the dew of heaven , And of the fatness of the earth , And an abundance of grain and new wine ;
1:27:002:1	The Stolen Blessing
1:27:029:0	May peoples serve you , And nations bow down to you ; Be master of your brothers , And may your mother’s sons bow down to you . Cursed be those who curse you , And blessed be those who bless you . ”
1:27:030:0	Now it came about , as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob , and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
1:27:031:0	Then he also made savory food , and brought it to his father ; and he said to his father , “ Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game , that you may bless me . ”
1:27:032:0	Isaac his father said to him , “ Who are you ? ” And he said , “ I am your son , your firstborn , Esau . ”
1:27:033:0	Then Isaac trembled violently , and said , “ Who was he then that hunted game and brought it to me , so that I ate of all of it before you came , and blessed him ? Yes , and he shall be blessed . ”
1:27:034:0	When Esau heard the words of his father , he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry , and said to his father , “ Bless me , even me also , O my father ! ”
1:27:035:0	And he said , “ Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing . ”
1:27:036:0	Then he said , “ Is he not rightly named Jacob , for he has supplanted me these two times ? He took away my birthright , and behold , now he has taken away my blessing . ” And he said , “ Have you not reserved a blessing for me ? ”
1:27:037:0	But Isaac replied to Esau , “ Behold , I have made him your master , and all his relatives I have given to him as servants ; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him . Now as for you then , what can I do , my son ? ”
1:27:038:0	Esau said to his father , “ Do you have only one blessing , my father ? Bless me , even me also , O my father . ” So Esau lifted his voice and wept .
1:27:039:0	Then Isaac his father answered and said to him , “ Behold , away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling , And away from the dew of heaven from above .
1:27:040:0	By your sword you shall live , And your brother you shall serve ; But it shall come about when you become restless , That you will break his yoke from your neck . ”
1:27:041:0	So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him ; and Esau said to himself , “ The days of mourning for my father are near ; then I will kill my brother Jacob . ”
1:27:042:0	Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah , she sent and called her younger son Jacob , and said to him , “ Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you .
1:27:043:0	Now therefore , my son , obey my voice , and arise , flee to Haran , to my brother Laban !
1:27:044:0	Stay with him a few days , until your brother’s fury subsides ,
1:27:045:0	until your brother’s anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him . Then I will send and get you from there . Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day ? ”
1:27:046:0	Rebekah said to Isaac , “ I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth ; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth , like these , from the daughters of the land , what good will my life be to me ? ”
