1:7:001:1	The Flood
1:7:001:0	Then the Lord said to Noah , “ Enter the ark , you and all your household , for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this time .
1:7:002:0	You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens , a male and his female ; and of the animals that are not clean two , a male and his female ;
1:7:003:0	also of the birds of the sky , by sevens , male and female , to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth .
1:7:004:0	For after seven more days , I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights ; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made . ”
1:7:005:0	Noah did according to all that the Lord had commanded him .
1:7:006:0	Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth .
1:7:007:0	Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood .
1:7:008:0	Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground ,
1:7:009:0	there went into the ark to Noah by twos , male and female , as God had commanded Noah .
1:7:010:0	It came about after the seven days , that the water of the flood came upon the earth .
1:7:011:0	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life , in the second month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open , and the floodgates of the sky were opened .
1:7:012:0	The rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights .
1:7:013:0	On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them , entered the ark ,
1:7:014:0	they and every beast after its kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind , and every bird after its kind , all sorts of birds .
1:7:015:0	So they went into the ark to Noah , by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life .
1:7:016:0	Those that entered , male and female of all flesh , entered as God had commanded him ; and the Lord closed it behind him .
1:7:017:0	Then the flood came upon the earth for forty days , and the water increased and lifted up the ark , so that it rose above the earth .
1:7:018:0	The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth , and the ark floated on the surface of the water .
1:7:019:0	The water prevailed more and more upon the earth , so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered .
1:7:020:0	The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher , and the mountains were covered .
1:7:021:0	All flesh that moved on the earth perished , birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth , and all mankind ;
1:7:022:0	of all that was on the dry land , all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life , died .
1:7:023:0	Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land , from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky , and they were blotted out from the earth ; and only Noah was left , together with those that were with him in the ark .
1:7:024:0	The water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days .
