1:49:001:1	Israel’s Prophecy concerning His Sons
1:49:001:0	Then Jacob summoned his sons and said , “ Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will befall you in the days to come .
1:49:002:0	Gather together and hear , O sons of Jacob ; And listen to Israel your father .
1:49:003:0	“ Reuben , you are my firstborn ; My might and the beginning of my strength , Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power .
1:49:004:0	Uncontrolled as water , you shall not have preeminence , Because you went up to your father’s bed ; Then you defiled it—he went up to my couch .
1:49:005:0	“ Simeon and Levi are brothers ; Their swords are implements of violence .
1:49:006:0	Let my soul not enter into their council ; Let not my glory be united with their assembly ; Because in their anger they slew men , And in their self-will they lamed oxen .
1:49:007:0	Cursed be their anger , for it is fierce ; And their wrath , for it is cruel . I will disperse them in Jacob , And scatter them in Israel .
1:49:008:0	“ Judah , your brothers shall praise you ; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies ; Your father’s sons shall bow down to you .
1:49:009:0	Judah is a lion’s whelp ; From the prey , my son , you have gone up . He couches , he lies down as a lion , And as a lion , who dares rouse him up ?
1:49:010:0	The scepter shall not depart from Judah , Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet , Until Shiloh comes , And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples .
1:49:011:0	He ties his foal to the vine , And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine ; He washes his garments in wine , And his robes in the blood of grapes .
1:49:012:0	His eyes are dull from wine , And his teeth white from milk .
1:49:013:0	“ Zebulun will dwell at the seashore ; And he shall be a haven for ships , And his flank shall be toward Sidon .
1:49:014:0	“ Issachar is a strong donkey , Lying down between the sheepfolds .
1:49:015:0	When he saw that a resting place was goodAnd that the land was pleasant , He bowed his shoulder to bear burdens , And became a slave at forced labor .
1:49:016:0	“ Dan shall judge his people , As one of the tribes of Israel .
1:49:017:0	Dan shall be a serpent in the way , A horned snake in the path , That bites the horse’s heels , So that his rider falls backward .
1:49:018:0	For Your salvation I wait , O Lord .
1:49:019:0	“ As for Gad , raiders shall raid him , But he will raid at their heels .
1:49:020:0	“ As for Asher , his food shall be rich , And he will yield royal dainties .
1:49:021:0	“ Naphtali is a doe let loose , He gives beautiful words .
1:49:022:0	“ Joseph is a fruitful bough , A fruitful bough by a spring ; Its branches run over a wall .
1:49:023:0	The archers bitterly attacked him , And shot at him and harassed him ;
1:49:024:0	But his bow remained firm , And his arms were agile , From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob ( From there is the Shepherd , the Stone of Israel ) ,
1:49:025:0	From the God of your father who helps you , And by the Almighty who blesses you With blessings of heaven above , Blessings of the deep that lies beneath , Blessings of the breasts and of the womb .
1:49:026:0	The blessings of your fatherHave surpassed the blessings of my ancestorsUp to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills ; May they be on the head of Joseph , And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers .
1:49:027:0	“ Benjamin is a ravenous wolf ; In the morning he devours the prey , And in the evening he divides the spoil . ”
1:49:028:0	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them . He blessed them , every one with the blessing appropriate to him .
1:49:029:0	Then he charged them and said to them , “ I am about to be gathered to my people ; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
1:49:030:0	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site .
1:49:031:0	There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah , there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah , and there I buried Leah—
1:49:032:0	the field and the cave that is in it , purchased from the sons of Heth . ”
1:49:033:0	When Jacob finished charging his sons , he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last , and was gathered to his people .
