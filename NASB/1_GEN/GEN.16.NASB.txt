1:16:001:1	Sarai and Hagar
1:16:001:0	Now Sarai , Abram’s wife had borne him no children , and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar .
1:16:002:0	So Sarai said to Abram , “ Now behold , the Lord has prevented me from bearing children . Please go in to my maid ; perhaps I will obtain children through her . ” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai .
1:16:003:0	After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan , Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian , her maid , and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife .
1:16:004:0	He went in to Hagar , and she conceived ; and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her sight .
1:16:005:0	And Sarai said to Abram , “ May the wrong done me be upon you . I gave my maid into your arms , but when she saw that she had conceived , I was despised in her sight . May the Lord judge between you and me . ”
1:16:006:0	But Abram said to Sarai , “ Behold , your maid is in your power ; do to her what is good in your sight . ” So Sarai treated her harshly , and she fled from her presence .
1:16:007:0	Now the angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness , by the spring on the way to Shur .
1:16:008:0	He said , “ Hagar , Sarai’s maid , where have you come from and where are you going ? ” And she said , “ I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai . ”
1:16:009:0	Then the angel of the Lord said to her , “ Return to your mistress , and submit yourself to her authority . ”
1:16:010:0	Moreover , the angel of the Lord said to her , “ I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count . ”
1:16:011:0	The angel of the Lord said to her further , “ Behold , you are with child , And you will bear a son ; And you shall call his name Ishmael , Because the Lord has given heed to your affliction .
1:16:012:0	He will be a wild donkey of a man , His hand will be against everyone , And everyone’s hand will be against him ; And he will live to the east of all his brothers . ”
1:16:013:0	Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her , “ You are a God who sees ” ; for she said , “ Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him ? ”
1:16:014:0	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi ; behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
1:16:015:0	So Hagar bore Abram a son ; and Abram called the name of his son , whom Hagar bore , Ishmael .
1:16:016:0	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him .
