1:35:001:1	Jacob Moves to Bethel
1:35:001:0	Then God said to Jacob , “ Arise , go up to Bethel and live there , and make an altar there to God , who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau . ”
1:35:002:0	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him , “ Put away the foreign gods which are among you , and purify yourselves and change your garments ;
1:35:003:0	and let us arise and go up to Bethel , and I will make an altar there to God , who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone . ”
1:35:004:0	So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears , and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem .
1:35:005:0	As they journeyed , there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them , and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob .
1:35:006:0	So Jacob came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) , which is in the land of Canaan , he and all the people who were with him .
1:35:007:0	He built an altar there , and called the place El-bethel , because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother .
1:35:002:1	Jacob Is Named Israel
1:35:008:0	Now Deborah , Rebekah’s nurse , died , and she was buried below Bethel under the oak ; it was named Allon-bacuth .
1:35:009:0	Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram , and He blessed him .
1:35:010:0	God said to him , “ Your name is Jacob ; You shall no longer be called Jacob , But Israel shall be your name . ” Thus He called him Israel .
1:35:011:0	God also said to him , “ I am God Almighty ; Be fruitful and multiply ; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you , And kings shall come forth from you .
1:35:012:0	The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , And I will give the land to your descendants after you . ”
1:35:013:0	Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him .
1:35:014:0	Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him , a pillar of stone , and he poured out a drink offering on it ; he also poured oil on it .
1:35:015:0	So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him , Bethel .
1:35:016:0	Then they journeyed from Bethel ; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath , Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe labor .
1:35:017:0	When she was in severe labor the midwife said to her , “ Do not fear , for now you have another son . ”
1:35:018:0	It came about as her soul was departing ( for she died ) , that she named him Ben-oni ; but his father called him Benjamin .
1:35:019:0	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) .
1:35:020:0	Jacob set up a pillar over her grave ; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day .
1:35:021:0	Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder .
1:35:003:1	The Sons of Israel
1:35:022:0	It came about while Israel was dwelling in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine , and Israel heard of it . Now there were twelve sons of Jacob—
1:35:023:0	the sons of Leah : Reuben , Jacob’s firstborn , then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun ;
1:35:024:0	the sons of Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin ;
1:35:025:0	and the sons of Bilhah , Rachel’s maid : Dan and Naphtali ;
1:35:026:0	and the sons of Zilpah , Leah’s maid : Gad and Asher . These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram .
1:35:027:0	Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) , where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned .
1:35:028:0	Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years .
1:35:029:0	Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people , an old man of ripe age ; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
