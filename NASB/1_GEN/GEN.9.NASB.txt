1:9:001:1	Covenant of the Rainbow
1:9:001:0	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them , “ Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth .
1:9:002:0	The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky ; with everything that creeps on the ground , and all the fish of the sea , into your hand they are given .
1:9:003:0	Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you ; I give all to you , as I gave the green plant .
1:9:004:0	Only you shall not eat flesh with its life , that is , its blood .
1:9:005:0	Surely I will require your lifeblood ; from every beast I will require it . And from every man , from every man’s brother I will require the life of man .
1:9:006:0	Whoever sheds man’s blood , By man his blood shall be shed , For in the image of GodHe made man .
1:9:007:0	As for you , be fruitful and multiply ; Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it . ”
1:9:008:0	Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him , saying ,
1:9:009:0	“ Now behold , I Myself do establish My covenant with you , and with your descendants after you ;
1:9:010:0	and with every living creature that is with you , the birds , the cattle , and every beast of the earth with you ; of all that comes out of the ark , even every beast of the earth .
1:9:011:0	I establish My covenant with you ; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood , neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth . ”
1:9:012:0	God said , “ This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you , for all successive generations ;
1:9:013:0	I set My bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth .
1:9:014:0	It shall come about , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow will be seen in the cloud ,
1:9:015:0	and I will remember My covenant , which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh .
1:9:016:0	When the bow is in the cloud , then I will look upon it , to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . ”
1:9:017:0	And God said to Noah , “ This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth . ”
1:9:018:0	Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth ; and Ham was the father of Canaan .
1:9:019:0	These three were the sons of Noah , and from these the whole earth was populated .
1:9:020:0	Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard .
1:9:021:0	He drank of the wine and became drunk , and uncovered himself inside his tent .
1:9:022:0	Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brothers outside .
1:9:023:0	But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were turned away , so that they did not see their father’s nakedness .
1:9:024:0	When Noah awoke from his wine , he knew what his youngest son had done to him .
1:9:025:0	So he said , “ Cursed be Canaan ; A servant of servantsHe shall be to his brothers . ”
1:9:026:0	He also said , “ Blessed be the Lord , The God of Shem ; And let Canaan be his servant .
1:9:027:0	May God enlarge Japheth , And let him dwell in the tents of Shem ; And let Canaan be his servant . ”
1:9:028:0	Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood .
1:9:029:0	So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years , and he died .
