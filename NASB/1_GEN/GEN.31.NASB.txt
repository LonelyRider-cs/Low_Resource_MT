1:31:001:1	Jacob Leaves Secretly for Canaan
1:31:001:0	Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons , saying , “ Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s , and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth . ”
1:31:002:0	Jacob saw the attitude of Laban , and behold , it was not friendly toward him as formerly .
1:31:003:0	Then the Lord said to Jacob , “ Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives , and I will be with you . ”
1:31:004:0	So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field ,
1:31:005:0	and said to them , “ I see your father’s attitude , that it is not friendly toward me as formerly , but the God of my father has been with me .
1:31:006:0	You know that I have served your father with all my strength .
1:31:007:0	Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times ; however , God did not allow him to hurt me .
1:31:008:0	If he spoke thus , ‘The speckled shall be your wages , ’ then all the flock brought forth speckled ; and if he spoke thus , ‘The striped shall be your wages , ’ then all the flock brought forth striped .
1:31:009:0	Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me .
1:31:010:0	And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which were mating were striped , speckled , and mottled .
1:31:011:0	Then the angel of God said to me in the dream , ‘Jacob , ’ and I said , ‘Here I am . ’
1:31:012:0	He said , ‘Lift up now your eyes and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped , speckled , and mottled ; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you .
1:31:013:0	I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a pillar , where you made a vow to Me ; now arise , leave this land , and return to the land of your birth . ’ ”
1:31:014:0	Rachel and Leah said to him , “ Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house ?
1:31:015:0	Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners ? For he has sold us , and has also entirely consumed our purchase price .
1:31:016:0	Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children ; now then , do whatever God has said to you . ”
1:31:017:0	Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels ;
1:31:018:0	and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered , his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram , to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac .
1:31:019:0	When Laban had gone to shear his flock , then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father’s .
1:31:020:0	And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing .
1:31:002:1	Laban Pursues Jacob
1:31:021:0	So he fled with all that he had ; and he arose and crossed the Euphrates River , and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead .
1:31:022:0	When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled ,
1:31:023:0	then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him a distance of seven days’ journey , and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead .
1:31:024:0	God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him , “ Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad . ”
1:31:025:0	Laban caught up with Jacob . Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country , and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead .
1:31:026:0	Then Laban said to Jacob , “ What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword ?
1:31:027:0	Why did you flee secretly and deceive me , and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs , with timbrel and with lyre ;
1:31:028:0	and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? Now you have done foolishly .
1:31:029:0	It is in my power to do you harm , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ‘Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob . ’
1:31:030:0	Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father’s house ; but why did you steal my gods ? ”
1:31:031:0	Then Jacob replied to Laban , “ Because I was afraid , for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force .
1:31:032:0	The one with whom you find your gods shall not live ; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take it for yourself . ” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them .
1:31:033:0	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two maids , but he did not find them . Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent .
1:31:034:0	Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddle , and she sat on them . And Laban felt through all the tent but did not find them .
1:31:035:0	She said to her father , “ Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you , for the manner of women is upon me . ” So he searched but did not find the household idols .
1:31:036:0	Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban ; and Jacob said to Laban , “ What is my transgression ? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me ?
1:31:037:0	Though you have felt through all my goods , what have you found of all your household goods ? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen , that they may decide between us two .
1:31:038:0	These twenty years I have been with you ; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried , nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks .
1:31:039:0	That which was torn of beasts I did not bring to you ; I bore the loss of it myself . You required it of my hand whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
1:31:040:0	Thus I was : by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night , and my sleep fled from my eyes .
1:31:041:0	These twenty years I have been in your house ; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock , and you changed my wages ten times .
1:31:003:1	The Covenant of Mizpah
1:31:042:0	If the God of my father , the God of Abraham , and the fear of Isaac , had not been for me , surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed . God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands , so He rendered judgment last night . ”
1:31:043:0	Then Laban replied to Jacob , “ The daughters are my daughters , and the children are my children , and the flocks are my flocks , and all that you see is mine . But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne ?
1:31:044:0	So now come , let us make a covenant , you and I , and let it be a witness between you and me . ”
1:31:045:0	Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar .
1:31:046:0	Jacob said to his kinsmen , “ Gather stones . ” So they took stones and made a heap , and they ate there by the heap .
1:31:047:0	Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha , but Jacob called it Galeed .
1:31:048:0	Laban said , “ This heap is a witness between you and me this day . ” Therefore it was named Galeed ,
1:31:049:0	and Mizpah , for he said , “ May the Lord watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other .
1:31:050:0	If you mistreat my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , although no man is with us , see , God is witness between you and me . ”
1:31:051:0	Laban said to Jacob , “ Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me .
1:31:052:0	This heap is a witness , and the pillar is a witness , that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm , and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
1:31:053:0	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us . ” So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac .
1:31:054:0	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain , and called his kinsmen to the meal ; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain .
1:31:055:0	Early in the morning Laban arose , and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them . Then Laban departed and returned to his place .
