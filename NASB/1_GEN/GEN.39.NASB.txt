1:39:001:1	Joseph’s Success in Egypt
1:39:001:0	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh , the captain of the bodyguard , bought him from the Ishmaelites , who had taken him down there .
1:39:002:0	The Lord was with Joseph , so he became a successful man . And he was in the house of his master , the Egyptian .
1:39:003:0	Now his master saw that the Lord was with him and how the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand .
1:39:004:0	So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant ; and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he owned he put in his charge .
1:39:005:0	It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned , the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph ; thus the Lord’s blessing was upon all that he owned , in the house and in the field .
1:39:006:0	So he left everything he owned in Joseph’s charge ; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate . Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance .
1:39:007:0	It came about after these events that his master’s wife looked with desire at Joseph , and she said , “ Lie with me . ”
1:39:008:0	But he refused and said to his master’s wife , “ Behold , with me here , my master does not concern himself with anything in the house , and he has put all that he owns in my charge .
1:39:009:0	There is no one greater in this house than I , and he has withheld nothing from me except you , because you are his wife . How then could I do this great evil and sin against God ? ”
1:39:010:0	As she spoke to Joseph day after day , he did not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her .
1:39:011:0	Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work , and none of the men of the household was there inside .
1:39:012:0	She caught him by his garment , saying , “ Lie with me ! ” And he left his garment in her hand and fled , and went outside .
1:39:013:0	When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside ,
1:39:014:0	she called to the men of her household and said to them , “ See , he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us ; he came in to me to lie with me , and I screamed .
1:39:015:0	When he heard that I raised my voice and screamed , he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside . ”
1:39:016:0	So she left his garment beside her until his master came home .
1:39:017:0	Then she spoke to him with these words , “ The Hebrew slave , whom you brought to us , came in to me to make sport of me ;
1:39:002:1	Joseph Imprisoned
1:39:018:0	and as I raised my voice and screamed , he left his garment beside me and fled outside . ”
1:39:019:0	Now when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , “ This is what your slave did to me , ” his anger burned .
1:39:020:0	So Joseph’s master took him and put him into the jail , the place where the king’s prisoners were confined ; and he was there in the jail .
1:39:021:0	But the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him , and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer .
1:39:022:0	The chief jailer committed to Joseph’s charge all the prisoners who were in the jail ; so that whatever was done there , he was responsible for it .
1:39:023:0	The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph’s charge because the Lord was with him ; and whatever he did , the Lord made to prosper .
