1:24:001:1	A Bride for Isaac
1:24:001:0	Now Abraham was old , advanced in age ; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in every way .
1:24:002:0	Abraham said to his servant , the oldest of his household , who had charge of all that he owned , “ Please place your hand under my thigh ,
1:24:003:0	and I will make you swear by the Lord , the God of heaven and the God of earth , that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I live ,
1:24:004:0	but you will go to my country and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son Isaac . ”
1:24:005:0	The servant said to him , “ Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land ; should I take your son back to the land from where you came ? ”
1:24:006:0	Then Abraham said to him , “ Beware that you do not take my son back there !
1:24:007:0	The Lord , the God of heaven , who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth , and who spoke to me and who swore to me , saying , ‘To your descendants I will give this land , ’ He will send His angel before you , and you will take a wife for my son from there .
1:24:008:0	But if the woman is not willing to follow you , then you will be free from this my oath ; only do not take my son back there . ”
1:24:009:0	So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and swore to him concerning this matter .
1:24:010:0	Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master , and set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand ; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nahor .
1:24:011:0	He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time , the time when women go out to draw water .
1:24:012:0	He said , “ O Lord , the God of my master Abraham , please grant me success today , and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham .
1:24:013:0	Behold , I am standing by the spring , and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water ;
1:24:002:1	Rebekah Is Chosen
1:24:014:0	now may it be that the girl to whom I say , ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink , ’ and who answers , ‘Drink , and I will water your camels also’—may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac ; and by this I will know that You have shown lovingkindness to my master . ”
1:24:015:0	Before he had finished speaking , behold , Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah , the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor , came out with her jar on her shoulder .
1:24:016:0	The girl was very beautiful , a virgin , and no man had had relations with her ; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up .
1:24:017:0	Then the servant ran to meet her , and said , “ Please let me drink a little water from your jar . ”
1:24:018:0	She said , “ Drink , my lord ” ; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand , and gave him a drink .
1:24:019:0	Now when she had finished giving him a drink , she said , “ I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking . ”
1:24:020:0	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough , and ran back to the well to draw , and she drew for all his camels .
1:24:021:0	Meanwhile , the man was gazing at her in silence , to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not .
1:24:022:0	When the camels had finished drinking , the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold ,
1:24:023:0	and said , “ Whose daughter are you ? Please tell me , is there room for us to lodge in your father’s house ? ”
1:24:024:0	She said to him , “ I am the daughter of Bethuel , the son of Milcah , whom she bore to Nahor . ”
1:24:025:0	Again she said to him , “ We have plenty of both straw and feed , and room to lodge in . ”
1:24:026:0	Then the man bowed low and worshiped the Lord .
1:24:027:0	He said , “ Blessed be the Lord , the God of my master Abraham , who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His truth toward my master ; as for me , the Lord has guided me in the way to the house of my master’s brothers . ”
1:24:028:0	Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things .
1:24:029:0	Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban ; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring .
1:24:030:0	When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists , and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister , saying , “ This is what the man said to me , ” he went to the man ; and behold , he was standing by the camels at the spring .
1:24:031:0	And he said , “ Come in , blessed of the Lord ! Why do you stand outside since I have prepared the house , and a place for the camels ? ”
1:24:032:0	So the man entered the house . Then Laban unloaded the camels , and he gave straw and feed to the camels , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
1:24:033:0	But when food was set before him to eat , he said , “ I will not eat until I have told my business . ” And he said , “ Speak on . ”
1:24:034:0	So he said , “ I am Abraham’s servant .
1:24:035:0	The Lord has greatly blessed my master , so that he has become rich ; and He has given him flocks and herds , and silver and gold , and servants and maids , and camels and donkeys .
1:24:036:0	Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master in her old age , and he has given him all that he has .
1:24:037:0	My master made me swear , saying , ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I live ;
1:24:038:0	but you shall go to my father’s house and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son . ’
1:24:039:0	I said to my master , ‘Suppose the woman does not follow me . ’
1:24:040:0	He said to me , ‘The Lord , before whom I have walked , will send His angel with you to make your journey successful , and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house ;
1:24:041:0	then you will be free from my oath , when you come to my relatives ; and if they do not give her to you , you will be free from my oath . ’
1:24:042:0	“ So I came today to the spring , and said , ‘O Lord , the God of my master Abraham , if now You will make my journey on which I go successful ;
1:24:043:0	behold , I am standing by the spring , and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw , and to whom I say , “ Please let me drink a little water from your jar ” ;
1:24:044:0	and she will say to me , “ You drink , and I will draw for your camels also ” ; let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master’s son . ’
1:24:045:0	“ Before I had finished speaking in my heart , behold , Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder , and went down to the spring and drew , and I said to her , ‘Please let me drink . ’
1:24:046:0	She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder , and said , ‘Drink , and I will water your camels also’ ; so I drank , and she watered the camels also .
1:24:047:0	Then I asked her , and said , ‘Whose daughter are you ? ’ And she said , ‘The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor’s son , whom Milcah bore to him’ ; and I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her wrists .
1:24:048:0	And I bowed low and worshiped the Lord , and blessed the Lord , the God of my master Abraham , who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son .
1:24:049:0	So now if you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me ; and if not , let me know , that I may turn to the right hand or the left . ”
1:24:050:0	Then Laban and Bethuel replied , “ The matter comes from the Lord ; so we cannot speak to you bad or good .
1:24:051:0	Here is Rebekah before you , take her and go , and let her be the wife of your master’s son , as the Lord has spoken . ”
1:24:052:0	When Abraham’s servant heard their words , he bowed himself to the ground before the Lord .
1:24:053:0	The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold , and garments , and gave them to Rebekah ; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother .
1:24:054:0	Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night . When they arose in the morning , he said , “ Send me away to my master . ”
1:24:055:0	But her brother and her mother said , “ Let the girl stay with us a few days , say ten ; afterward she may go . ”
1:24:056:0	He said to them , “ Do not delay me , since the Lord has prospered my way . Send me away that I may go to my master . ”
1:24:057:0	And they said , “ We will call the girl and consult her wishes . ”
1:24:058:0	Then they called Rebekah and said to her , “ Will you go with this man ? ” And she said , “ I will go . ”
1:24:059:0	Thus they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men .
1:24:060:0	They blessed Rebekah and said to her , “ May you , our sister , Become thousands of ten thousands , And may your descendants possessThe gate of those who hate them . ”
1:24:003:1	Isaac Marries Rebekah
1:24:061:0	Then Rebekah arose with her maids , and they mounted the camels and followed the man . So the servant took Rebekah and departed .
1:24:062:0	Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi ; for he was living in the Negev .
1:24:063:0	Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening ; and he lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , camels were coming .
1:24:064:0	Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel .
1:24:065:0	She said to the servant , “ Who is that man walking in the field to meet us ? ” And the servant said , “ He is my master . ” Then she took her veil and covered herself .
1:24:066:0	The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done .
1:24:067:0	Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent , and he took Rebekah , and she became his wife , and he loved her ; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death .
