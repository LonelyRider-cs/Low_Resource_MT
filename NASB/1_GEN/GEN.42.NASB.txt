1:42:001:1	Joseph’s Brothers Sent to Egypt
1:42:001:0	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , “ Why are you staring at one another ? ”
1:42:002:0	He said , “ Behold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt ; go down there and buy some for us from that place , so that we may live and not die . ”
1:42:003:0	Then ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt .
1:42:004:0	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers , for he said , “ I am afraid that harm may befall him . ”
1:42:005:0	So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming , for the famine was in the land of Canaan also .
1:42:006:0	Now Joseph was the ruler over the land ; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land . And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground .
1:42:007:0	When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them , but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly . And he said to them , “ Where have you come from ? ” And they said , “ From the land of Canaan , to buy food . ”
1:42:008:0	But Joseph had recognized his brothers , although they did not recognize him .
1:42:009:0	Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them , and said to them , “ You are spies ; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land . ”
1:42:010:0	Then they said to him , “ No , my lord , but your servants have come to buy food .
1:42:011:0	We are all sons of one man ; we are honest men , your servants are not spies . ”
1:42:012:0	Yet he said to them , “ No , but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land ! ”
1:42:013:0	But they said , “ Your servants are twelve brothers in all , the sons of one man in the land of Canaan ; and behold , the youngest is with our father today , and one is no longer alive . ”
1:42:014:0	Joseph said to them , “ It is as I said to you , you are spies ;
1:42:015:0	by this you will be tested : by the life of Pharaoh , you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here !
1:42:016:0	Send one of you that he may get your brother , while you remain confined , that your words may be tested , whether there is truth in you . But if not , by the life of Pharaoh , surely you are spies . ”
1:42:017:0	So he put them all together in prison for three days .
1:42:018:0	Now Joseph said to them on the third day , “ Do this and live , for I fear God :
1:42:019:0	if you are honest men , let one of your brothers be confined in your prison ; but as for the rest of you , go , carry grain for the famine of your households ,
1:42:020:0	and bring your youngest brother to me , so your words may be verified , and you will not die . ” And they did so .
1:42:021:0	Then they said to one another , “ Truly we are guilty concerning our brother , because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us , yet we would not listen ; therefore this distress has come upon us . ”
1:42:022:0	Reuben answered them , saying , “ Did I not tell you , ‘Do not sin against the boy’ ; and you would not listen ? Now comes the reckoning for his blood . ”
1:42:023:0	They did not know , however , that Joseph understood , for there was an interpreter between them .
1:42:024:0	He turned away from them and wept . But when he returned to them and spoke to them , he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes .
1:42:025:0	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man’s money in his sack , and to give them provisions for the journey . And thus it was done for them .
1:42:026:0	So they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there .
1:42:027:0	As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place , he saw his money ; and behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .

1:42:028:0	Then he said to his brothers , “ My money has been returned , and behold , it is even in my sack . ” And their hearts sank , and they turned trembling to one another , saying , “ What is this that God has done to us ? ”
1:42:029:0	When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan , they told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
1:42:030:0	“ The man , the lord of the land , spoke harshly with us , and took us for spies of the country .
1:42:031:0	But we said to him , ‘We are honest men ; we are not spies .
1:42:032:0	We are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no longer alive , and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan . ’
1:42:033:0	The man , the lord of the land , said to us , ‘By this I will know that you are honest men : leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your households , and go .
1:42:034:0	But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies , but honest men . I will give your brother to you , and you may trade in the land . ’ ”
1:42:035:0	Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks , that behold , every man’s bundle of money was in his sack ; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money , they were dismayed .
1:42:036:0	Their father Jacob said to them , “ You have bereaved me of my children : Joseph is no more , and Simeon is no more , and you would take Benjamin ; all these things are against me . ”
1:42:037:0	Then Reuben spoke to his father , saying , “ You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you ; put him in my care , and I will return him to you . ”
1:42:038:0	But Jacob said , “ My son shall not go down with you ; for his brother is dead , and he alone is left . If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking , then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow . ”
