1:23:001:1	Death and Burial of Sarah
1:23:001:0	Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years ; these were the years of the life of Sarah .
1:23:002:0	Sarah died in Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) in the land of Canaan ; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her .
1:23:003:0	Then Abraham rose from before his dead , and spoke to the sons of Heth , saying ,
1:23:004:0	“ I am a stranger and a sojourner among you ; give me a burial site among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight . ”
1:23:005:0	The sons of Heth answered Abraham , saying to him ,
1:23:006:0	“ Hear us , my lord , you are a mighty prince among us ; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves ; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead . ”
1:23:007:0	So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land , the sons of Heth .
1:23:008:0	And he spoke with them , saying , “ If it is your wish for me to bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and approach Ephron the son of Zohar for me ,
1:23:009:0	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns , which is at the end of his field ; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site . ”
1:23:010:0	Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth ; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth ; even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
1:23:011:0	“ No , my lord , hear me ; I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you ; bury your dead . ”
1:23:012:0	And Abraham bowed before the people of the land .
1:23:013:0	He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land , saying , “ If you will only please listen to me ; I will give the price of the field , accept it from me that I may bury my dead there . ”
1:23:014:0	Then Ephron answered Abraham , saying to him ,
1:23:015:0	“ My lord , listen to me ; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver , what is that between me and you ? So bury your dead . ”
1:23:016:0	Abraham listened to Ephron ; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , commercial standard .
1:23:017:0	So Ephron’s field , which was in Machpelah , which faced Mamre , the field and cave which was in it , and all the trees which were in the field , that were within all the confines of its border , were deeded over
1:23:018:0	to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth , before all who went in at the gate of his city .
1:23:019:0	After this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre ( that is , Hebron ) in the land of Canaan .
1:23:020:0	So the field and the cave that is in it , were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth .
