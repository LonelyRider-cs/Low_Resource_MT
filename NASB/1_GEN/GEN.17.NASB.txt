1:17:001:1	Abraham and the Covenant of Circumcision
1:17:001:0	Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old , the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him , “ I am God Almighty ; Walk before Me , and be blameless .
1:17:002:0	I will establish My covenant between Me and you , And I will multiply you exceedingly . ”
1:17:003:0	Abram fell on his face , and God talked with him , saying ,
1:17:004:0	“ As for Me , behold , My covenant is with you , And you will be the father of a multitude of nations .
1:17:005:0	No longer shall your name be called Abram , But your name shall be Abraham ; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
1:17:006:0	I will make you exceedingly fruitful , and I will make nations of you , and kings will come forth from you .
1:17:007:0	I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be God to you and to your descendants after you .
1:17:008:0	I will give to you and to your descendants after you , the land of your sojournings , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God . ”
1:17:009:0	God said further to Abraham , “ Now as for you , you shall keep My covenant , you and your descendants after you throughout their generations .
1:17:010:0	This is My covenant , which you shall keep , between Me and you and your descendants after you : every male among you shall be circumcised .
1:17:011:0	And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin , and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you .
1:17:012:0	And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations , a servant who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner , who is not of your descendants .
1:17:013:0	A servant who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised ; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
1:17:014:0	But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that person shall be cut off from his people ; he has broken My covenant . ”
1:17:015:0	Then God said to Abraham , “ As for Sarai your wife , you shall not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall be her name .
1:17:016:0	I will bless her , and indeed I will give you a son by her . Then I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of peoples will come from her . ”
1:17:017:0	Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed , and said in his heart , “ Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old ? And will Sarah , who is ninety years old , bear a child ? ”
1:17:018:0	And Abraham said to God , “ Oh that Ishmael might live before You ! ”
1:17:019:0	But God said , “ No , but Sarah your wife will bear you a son , and you shall call his name Isaac ; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him .
1:17:020:0	As for Ishmael , I have heard you ; behold , I will bless him , and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly . He shall become the father of twelve princes , and I will make him a great nation .
1:17:021:0	But My covenant I will establish with Isaac , whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year . ”
1:17:022:0	When He finished talking with him , God went up from Abraham .
1:17:023:0	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all the servants who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham’s household , and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day , as God had said to him .
1:17:024:0	Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
1:17:025:0	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
1:17:026:0	In the very same day Abraham was circumcised , and Ishmael his son .
1:17:027:0	All the men of his household , who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
