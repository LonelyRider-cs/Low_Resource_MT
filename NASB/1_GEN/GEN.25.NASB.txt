1:25:001:1	Abraham’s Death
1:25:001:0	Now Abraham took another wife , whose name was Keturah .
1:25:002:0	She bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah .
1:25:003:0	Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan . And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim .
1:25:004:0	The sons of Midian were Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah . All these were the sons of Keturah .
1:25:005:0	Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac ;
1:25:006:0	but to the sons of his concubines , Abraham gave gifts while he was still living , and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward , to the land of the east .
1:25:007:0	These are all the years of Abraham’s life that he lived , one hundred and seventy-five years .
1:25:008:0	Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age , an old man and satisfied with life ; and he was gathered to his people .
1:25:009:0	Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , facing Mamre ,
1:25:010:0	the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth ; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife .
1:25:002:1	Descendants of Ishmael
1:25:011:0	It came about after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi .
1:25:012:0	Now these are the records of the generations of Ishmael , Abraham’s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah’s maid , bore to Abraham ;
1:25:013:0	and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , in the order of their birth : Nebaioth , the firstborn of Ishmael , and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
1:25:014:0	and Mishma and Dumah and Massa ,
1:25:015:0	Hadad and Tema , Jetur , Naphish and Kedemah .
1:25:016:0	These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names , by their villages , and by their camps ; twelve princes according to their tribes .
1:25:017:0	These are the years of the life of Ishmael , one hundred and thirty-seven years ; and he breathed his last and died , and was gathered to his people .
1:25:003:1	Isaac’s Sons
1:25:018:0	They settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria ; he settled in defiance of all his relatives .
1:25:019:0	Now these are the records of the generations of Isaac , Abraham’s son : Abraham became the father of Isaac ;
1:25:020:0	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram , the sister of Laban the Aramean , to be his wife .
1:25:021:0	Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife , because she was barren ; and the Lord answered him and Rebekah his wife conceived .
1:25:022:0	But the children struggled together within her ; and she said , “ If it is so , why then am I this way ? ” So she went to inquire of the Lord .
1:25:023:0	The Lord said to her , “ Two nations are in your womb ; And two peoples will be separated from your body ; And one people shall be stronger than the other ; And the older shall serve the younger . ”
1:25:024:0	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
1:25:025:0	Now the first came forth red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they named him Esau .
1:25:026:0	Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau’s heel , so his name was called Jacob ; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them .
1:25:027:0	When the boys grew up , Esau became a skillful hunter , a man of the field , but Jacob was a peaceful man , living in tents .
1:25:028:0	Now Isaac loved Esau , because he had a taste for game , but Rebekah loved Jacob .
1:25:029:0	When Jacob had cooked stew , Esau came in from the field and he was famished ;
1:25:030:0	and Esau said to Jacob , “ Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there , for I am famished . ” Therefore his name was called Edom .
1:25:031:0	But Jacob said , “ First sell me your birthright . ”
1:25:032:0	Esau said , “ Behold , I am about to die ; so of what use then is the birthright to me ? ”
1:25:033:0	And Jacob said , “ First swear to me ” ; so he swore to him , and sold his birthright to Jacob .
1:25:034:0	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew ; and he ate and drank , and rose and went on his way . Thus Esau despised his birthright .
