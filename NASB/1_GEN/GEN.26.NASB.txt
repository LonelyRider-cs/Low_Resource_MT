1:26:001:1	Isaac Settles in Gerar
1:26:001:0	Now there was a famine in the land , besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham . So Isaac went to Gerar , to Abimelech king of the Philistines .
1:26:002:0	The Lord appeared to him and said , “ Do not go down to Egypt ; stay in the land of which I shall tell you .
1:26:003:0	Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you , for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham .
1:26:004:0	I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven , and will give your descendants all these lands ; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed ;
1:26:005:0	because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge , My commandments , My statutes and My laws . ”
1:26:006:0	So Isaac lived in Gerar .
1:26:007:0	When the men of the place asked about his wife , he said , “ She is my sister , ” for he was afraid to say , “ my wife , ” thinking , “ the men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah , for she is beautiful . ”
1:26:008:0	It came about , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window , and saw , and behold , Isaac was caressing his wife Rebekah .
1:26:009:0	Then Abimelech called Isaac and said , “ Behold , certainly she is your wife ! How then did you say , ‘She is my sister’ ? ” And Isaac said to him , “ Because I said , ‘I might die on account of her . ’ ”
1:26:010:0	Abimelech said , “ What is this you have done to us ? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife , and you would have brought guilt upon us . ”
1:26:011:0	So Abimelech charged all the people , saying , “ He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death . ”
1:26:012:0	Now Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold . And the Lord blessed him ,
1:26:013:0	and the man became rich , and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy ;
1:26:014:0	for he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household , so that the Philistines envied him .
1:26:015:0	Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth .
1:26:016:0	Then Abimelech said to Isaac , “ Go away from us , for you are too powerful for us . ”
1:26:002:1	Quarrel over the Wells
1:26:017:0	And Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar , and settled there .
1:26:018:0	Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham , for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham ; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them .
1:26:019:0	But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water ,
1:26:020:0	the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac , saying , “ The water is ours ! ” So he named the well Esek , because they contended with him .
1:26:021:0	Then they dug another well , and they quarreled over it too , so he named it Sitnah .
1:26:022:0	He moved away from there and dug another well , and they did not quarrel over it ; so he named it Rehoboth , for he said , “ At last the Lord has made room for us , and we will be fruitful in the land . ”
1:26:023:0	Then he went up from there to Beersheba .
1:26:024:0	The Lord appeared to him the same night and said , “ I am the God of your father Abraham ; Do not fear , for I am with you . I will bless you , and multiply your descendants , For the sake of My servant Abraham . ”
1:26:003:1	Covenant with Abimelech
1:26:025:0	So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord , and pitched his tent there ; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well .
1:26:026:0	Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath and Phicol the commander of his army .
1:26:027:0	Isaac said to them , “ Why have you come to me , since you hate me and have sent me away from you ? ”
1:26:028:0	They said , “ We see plainly that the Lord has been with you ; so we said , ‘Let there now be an oath between us , even between you and us , and let us make a covenant with you ,
1:26:029:0	that you will do us no harm , just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace . You are now the blessed of the Lord . ’ ”
1:26:030:0	Then he made them a feast , and they ate and drank .
1:26:031:0	In the morning they arose early and exchanged oaths ; then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace .
1:26:032:0	Now it came about on the same day , that Isaac’s servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug , and said to him , “ We have found water . ”
1:26:033:0	So he called it Shibah ; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day .
1:26:034:0	When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite ;
1:26:035:0	and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah .
