1:14:001:1	War of the Kings
1:14:001:0	And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , and Tidal king of Goiim ,
1:14:002:0	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom , and with Birsha king of Gomorrah , Shinab king of Admah , and Shemeber king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( that is , Zoar ) .
1:14:003:0	All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim ( that is , the Salt Sea ) .
1:14:004:0	Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer , but the thirteenth year they rebelled .
1:14:005:0	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him , came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim ,
1:14:006:0	and the Horites in their Mount Seir , as far as El-paran , which is by the wilderness .
1:14:007:0	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat ( that is , Kadesh ) , and conquered all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , who lived in Hazazon-tamar .
1:14:008:0	And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela ( that is , Zoar ) came out ; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim ,
1:14:009:0	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five .
1:14:010:0	Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and they fell into them . But those who survived fled to the hill country .
1:14:011:0	Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply , and departed .
1:14:012:0	They also took Lot , Abram’s nephew , and his possessions and departed , for he was living in Sodom .
1:14:013:0	Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew . Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner , and these were allies with Abram .
1:14:014:0	When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and eighteen , and went in pursuit as far as Dan .
1:14:015:0	He divided his forces against them by night , he and his servants , and defeated them , and pursued them as far as Hobah , which is north of Damascus .
1:14:002:1	God’s Promise to Abram
1:14:016:0	He brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions , and also the women , and the people .
1:14:017:0	Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him , the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh ( that is , the King’s Valley ) .
1:14:018:0	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine ; now he was a priest of God Most High .
1:14:019:0	He blessed him and said , “ Blessed be Abram of God Most High , Possessor of heaven and earth ;
1:14:020:0	And blessed be God Most High , Who has delivered your enemies into your hand . ” He gave him a tenth of all .
1:14:021:0	The king of Sodom said to Abram , “ Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself . ”
1:14:022:0	Abram said to the king of Sodom , “ I have sworn to the Lord God Most High , possessor of heaven and earth ,
1:14:023:0	that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours , for fear you would say , ‘I have made Abram rich . ’
1:14:024:0	I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten , and the share of the men who went with me , Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre ; let them take their share . ”
