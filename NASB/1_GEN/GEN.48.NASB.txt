1:48:001:1	Israel’s Last Days
1:48:001:0	Now it came about after these things that Joseph was told , “ Behold , your father is sick . ” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him .
1:48:002:0	When it was told to Jacob , “ Behold , your son Joseph has come to you , ” Israel collected his strength and sat up in the bed .
1:48:003:0	Then Jacob said to Joseph , “ God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me ,
1:48:004:0	and He said to me , ‘Behold , I will make you fruitful and numerous , and I will make you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession . ’
1:48:005:0	Now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt , are mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine , as Reuben and Simeon are .
1:48:006:0	But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours ; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance .
1:48:007:0	Now as for me , when I came from Paddan , Rachel died , to my sorrow , in the land of Canaan on the journey , when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath ; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) . ”
1:48:008:0	When Israel saw Joseph’s sons , he said , “ Who are these ? ”
1:48:009:0	Joseph said to his father , “ They are my sons , whom God has given me here . ” So he said , “ Bring them to me , please , that I may bless them . ”
1:48:010:0	Now the eyes of Israel were so dim from age that he could not see . Then Joseph brought them close to him , and he kissed them and embraced them .
1:48:011:0	Israel said to Joseph , “ I never expected to see your face , and behold , God has let me see your children as well . ”
1:48:012:0	Then Joseph took them from his knees , and bowed with his face to the ground .
1:48:013:0	Joseph took them both , Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left , and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right , and brought them close to him .
1:48:014:0	But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim , who was the younger , and his left hand on Manasseh’s head , crossing his hands , although Manasseh was the firstborn .
1:48:015:0	He blessed Joseph , and said , “ The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , The God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day ,
1:48:016:0	The angel who has redeemed me from all evil , Bless the lads ; And may my name live on in them , And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . ”
1:48:017:0	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head , it displeased him ; and he grasped his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head .
1:48:018:0	Joseph said to his father , “ Not so , my father , for this one is the firstborn . Place your right hand on his head . ”
1:48:019:0	But his father refused and said , “ I know , my son , I know ; he also will become a people and he also will be great . However , his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations . ”
1:48:020:0	He blessed them that day , saying , “ By you Israel will pronounce blessing , saying , ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh ! ’ ” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh .
1:48:021:0	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Behold , I am about to die , but God will be with you , and bring you back to the land of your fathers .
1:48:022:0	I give you one portion more than your brothers , which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow . ”
