1:4:001:1	Cain and Abel
1:4:001:0	Now the man had relations with his wife Eve , and she conceived and gave birth to Cain , and she said , “ I have gotten a manchild with the help of the Lord . ”
1:4:002:0	Again , she gave birth to his brother Abel . And Abel was a keeper of flocks , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
1:4:003:0	So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the Lord of the fruit of the ground .
1:4:004:0	Abel , on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions . And the Lord had regard for Abel and for his offering ;
1:4:005:0	but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard . So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell .
1:4:006:0	Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Why are you angry ? And why has your countenance fallen ?
1:4:007:0	If you do well , will not your countenance be lifted up ? And if you do not do well , sin is crouching at the door ; and its desire is for you , but you must master it . ”
1:4:008:0	Cain told Abel his brother . And it came about when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him .
1:4:009:0	Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Where is Abel your brother ? ” And he said , “ I do not know . Am I my brother’s keeper ? ”
1:4:010:0	He said , “ What have you done ? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground .
1:4:011:0	Now you are cursed from the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand .
1:4:012:0	When you cultivate the ground , it will no longer yield its strength to you ; you will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth . ”
1:4:013:0	Cain said to the Lord , “ My punishment is too great to bear !
1:4:014:0	Behold , You have driven me this day from the face of the ground ; and from Your face I will be hidden , and I will be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth , and whoever finds me will kill me . ”
1:4:015:0	So the Lord said to him , “ Therefore whoever kills Cain , vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold . ” And the Lord appointed a sign for Cain , so that no one finding him would slay him .
1:4:016:0	Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , and settled in the land of Nod , east of Eden .
1:4:017:0	Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived , and gave birth to Enoch ; and he built a city , and called the name of the city Enoch , after the name of his son .
1:4:018:0	Now to Enoch was born Irad , and Irad became the father of Mehujael , and Mehujael became the father of Methushael , and Methushael became the father of Lamech .
1:4:019:0	Lamech took to himself two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other , Zillah .
1:4:020:0	Adah gave birth to Jabal ; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock .
1:4:021:0	His brother’s name was Jubal ; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe .
1:4:022:0	As for Zillah , she also gave birth to Tubal-cain , the forger of all implements of bronze and iron ; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah .
1:4:023:0	Lamech said to his wives , “ Adah and Zillah , Listen to my voice , You wives of Lamech , Give heed to my speech , For I have killed a man for wounding me ; And a boy for striking me ;
1:4:024:0	If Cain is avenged sevenfold , Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold . ”
1:4:025:0	Adam had relations with his wife again ; and she gave birth to a son , and named him Seth , for , she said , “ God has appointed me another offspring in place of Abel , for Cain killed him . ”
1:4:026:0	To Seth , to him also a son was born ; and he called his name Enosh . Then men began to call upon the name of the Lord .
