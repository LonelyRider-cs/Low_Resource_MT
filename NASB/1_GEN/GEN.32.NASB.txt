1:32:001:1	Jacob’s Fear of Esau
1:32:001:0	Now as Jacob went on his way , the angels of God met him .
1:32:002:0	Jacob said when he saw them , “ This is God’s camp . ” So he named that place Mahanaim .
1:32:003:0	Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir , the country of Edom .
1:32:004:0	He also commanded them saying , “ Thus you shall say to my lord Esau : ‘Thus says your servant Jacob , “ I have sojourned with Laban , and stayed until now ;
1:32:005:0	I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants ; and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find favor in your sight . ” ’ ”
1:32:006:0	The messengers returned to Jacob , saying , “ We came to your brother Esau , and furthermore he is coming to meet you , and four hundred men are with him . ”
1:32:007:0	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed ; and he divided the people who were with him , and the flocks and the herds and the camels , into two companies ;
1:32:008:0	for he said , “ If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it , then the company which is left will escape . ”
1:32:009:0	Jacob said , “ O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac , O Lord , who said to me , ‘Return to your country and to your relatives , and I will prosper you , ’
1:32:010:0	I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant ; for with my staff only I crossed this Jordan , and now I have become two companies .
1:32:011:0	Deliver me , I pray , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau ; for I fear him , that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children .
1:32:012:0	For You said , ‘I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea , which is too great to be numbered . ’ ”
1:32:013:0	So he spent the night there . Then he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau :
1:32:014:0	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
1:32:015:0	thirty milking camels and their colts , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys .
1:32:016:0	He delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by itself , and said to his servants , “ Pass on before me , and put a space between droves . ”
1:32:017:0	He commanded the one in front , saying , “ When my brother Esau meets you and asks you , saying , ‘To whom do you belong , and where are you going , and to whom do these animals in front of you belong ? ’
1:32:018:0	then you shall say , ‘These belong to your servant Jacob ; it is a present sent to my lord Esau . And behold , he also is behind us . ’ ”
1:32:019:0	Then he commanded also the second and the third , and all those who followed the droves , saying , “ After this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him ;
1:32:020:0	and you shall say , ‘Behold , your servant Jacob also is behind us . ’ ” For he said , “ I will appease him with the present that goes before me . Then afterward I will see his face ; perhaps he will accept me . ”
1:32:021:0	So the present passed on before him , while he himself spent that night in the camp .
1:32:022:0	Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children , and crossed the ford of the Jabbok .
1:32:002:1	Jacob Wrestles
1:32:023:0	He took them and sent them across the stream . And he sent across whatever he had .
1:32:024:0	Then Jacob was left alone , and a man wrestled with him until daybreak .
1:32:025:0	When he saw that he had not prevailed against him , he touched the socket of his thigh ; so the socket of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him .
1:32:026:0	Then he said , “ Let me go , for the dawn is breaking . ” But he said , “ I will not let you go unless you bless me . ”
1:32:027:0	So he said to him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Jacob . ”
1:32:028:0	He said , “ Your name shall no longer be Jacob , but Israel ; for you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed . ”
1:32:029:0	Then Jacob asked him and said , “ Please tell me your name . ” But he said , “ Why is it that you ask my name ? ” And he blessed him there .
1:32:030:0	So Jacob named the place Peniel , for he said , “ I have seen God face to face , yet my life has been preserved . ”
1:32:031:0	Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel , and he was limping on his thigh .
1:32:032:0	Therefore , to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh , because he touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip .
