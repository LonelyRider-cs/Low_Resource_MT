1:50:001:1	The Death of Israel
1:50:001:0	Then Joseph fell on his father’s face , and wept over him and kissed him .
1:50:002:0	Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father . So the physicians embalmed Israel .
1:50:003:0	Now forty days were required for it , for such is the period required for embalming . And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days .
1:50:004:0	When the days of mourning for him were past , Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh , saying , “ If now I have found favor in your sight , please speak to Pharaoh , saying ,
1:50:005:0	‘My father made me swear , saying , “ Behold , I am about to die ; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan , there you shall bury me . ” Now therefore , please let me go up and bury my father ; then I will return . ’ ”
1:50:006:0	Pharaoh said , “ Go up and bury your father , as he made you swear . ”
1:50:007:0	So Joseph went up to bury his father , and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
1:50:008:0	and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father’s household ; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen .
1:50:009:0	There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen ; and it was a very great company .
1:50:010:0	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan , they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation ; and he observed seven days mourning for his father .
1:50:002:1	Burial at Machpelah
1:50:011:0	Now when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad , they said , “ This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians . ” Therefore it was named Abel-mizraim , which is beyond the Jordan .
1:50:012:0	Thus his sons did for him as he had charged them ;
1:50:013:0	for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre , which Abraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite .
1:50:014:0	After he had buried his father , Joseph returned to Egypt , he and his brothers , and all who had gone up with him to bury his father .
1:50:015:0	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead , they said , “ What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him ! ”
1:50:016:0	So they sent a message to Joseph , saying , “ Your father charged before he died , saying ,
1:50:017:0	‘Thus you shall say to Joseph , “ Please forgive , I beg you , the transgression of your brothers and their sin , for they did you wrong . ” ’ And now , please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father . ” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him .
1:50:018:0	Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said , “ Behold , we are your servants . ”
1:50:019:0	But Joseph said to them , “ Do not be afraid , for am I in God’s place ?
1:50:020:0	As for you , you meant evil against me , but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result , to preserve many people alive .
1:50:003:1	Death of Joseph
1:50:021:0	So therefore , do not be afraid ; I will provide for you and your little ones . ” So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them .
1:50:022:0	Now Joseph stayed in Egypt , he and his father’s household , and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years .
1:50:023:0	Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s sons ; also the sons of Machir , the son of Manasseh , were born on Joseph’s knees .
1:50:024:0	Joseph said to his brothers , “ I am about to die , but God will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Abraham , to Isaac and to Jacob . ”
1:50:025:0	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear , saying , “ God will surely take care of you , and you shall carry my bones up from here . ”
1:50:026:0	So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years ; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt .
