1:38:001:1	Judah and Tamar
1:38:001:0	And it came about at that time , that Judah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
1:38:002:0	Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua ; and he took her and went in to her .
1:38:003:0	So she conceived and bore a son and he named him Er .
1:38:004:0	Then she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan .
1:38:005:0	She bore still another son and named him Shelah ; and it was at Chezib that she bore him .
1:38:006:0	Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
1:38:007:0	But Er , Judah’s firstborn , was evil in the sight of the Lord , so the Lord took his life .
1:38:008:0	Then Judah said to Onan , “ Go in to your brother’s wife , and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her , and raise up offspring for your brother . ”
1:38:009:0	Onan knew that the offspring would not be his ; so when he went in to his brother’s wife , he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother .
1:38:010:0	But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord ; so He took his life also .
1:38:011:0	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar , “ Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up ” ; for he thought , “ I am afraid that he too may die like his brothers . ” So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house .
1:38:012:0	Now after a considerable time Shua’s daughter , the wife of Judah , died ; and when the time of mourning was ended , Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
1:38:013:0	It was told to Tamar , “ Behold , your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep . ”
1:38:014:0	So she removed her widow’s garments and covered herself with a veil , and wrapped herself , and sat in the gateway of Enaim , which is on the road to Timnah ; for she saw that Shelah had grown up , and she had not been given to him as a wife .
1:38:015:0	When Judah saw her , he thought she was a harlot , for she had covered her face .
1:38:016:0	So he turned aside to her by the road , and said , “ Here now , let me come in to you ” ; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law . And she said , “ What will you give me , that you may come in to me ? ”
1:38:017:0	He said , therefore , “ I will send you a young goat from the flock . ” She said , moreover , “ Will you give a pledge until you send it ? ”
1:38:018:0	He said , “ What pledge shall I give you ? ” And she said , “ Your seal and your cord , and your staff that is in your hand . ” So he gave them to her and went in to her , and she conceived by him .
1:38:019:0	Then she arose and departed , and removed her veil and put on her widow’s garments .
1:38:020:0	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite , to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand , he did not find her .
1:38:021:0	He asked the men of her place , saying , “ Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim ? ” But they said , “ There has been no temple prostitute here . ”
1:38:022:0	So he returned to Judah , and said , “ I did not find her ; and furthermore , the men of the place said , ‘There has been no temple prostitute here . ’ ”
1:38:023:0	Then Judah said , “ Let her keep them , otherwise we will become a laughingstock . After all , I sent this young goat , but you did not find her . ”
1:38:024:0	Now it was about three months later that Judah was informed , “ Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot , and behold , she is also with child by harlotry . ” Then Judah said , “ Bring her out and let her be burned ! ”
1:38:025:0	It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law , saying , “ I am with child by the man to whom these things belong . ” And she said , “ Please examine and see , whose signet ring and cords and staff are these ? ”
1:38:026:0	Judah recognized them , and said , “ She is more righteous than I , inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah . ” And he did not have relations with her again .
1:38:027:0	It came about at the time she was giving birth , that behold , there were twins in her womb .
1:38:028:0	Moreover , it took place while she was giving birth , one put out a hand , and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand , saying , “ This one came out first . ”
1:38:029:0	But it came about as he drew back his hand , that behold , his brother came out . Then she said , “ What a breach you have made for yourself ! ” So he was named Perez .
1:38:030:0	Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet thread on his hand ; and he was named Zerah .
