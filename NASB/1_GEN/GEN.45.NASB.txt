1:45:001:1	Joseph Deals Kindly with His Brothers
1:45:001:0	Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him , and he cried , “ Have everyone go out from me . ” So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
1:45:002:0	He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it , and the household of Pharaoh heard of it .
1:45:003:0	Then Joseph said to his brothers , “ I am Joseph ! Is my father still alive ? ” But his brothers could not answer him , for they were dismayed at his presence .
1:45:004:0	Then Joseph said to his brothers , “ Please come closer to me . ” And they came closer . And he said , “ I am your brother Joseph , whom you sold into Egypt .
1:45:005:0	Now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves , because you sold me here , for God sent me before you to preserve life .
1:45:006:0	For the famine has been in the land these two years , and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting .
1:45:007:0	God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth , and to keep you alive by a great deliverance .
1:45:008:0	Now , therefore , it was not you who sent me here , but God ; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt .
1:45:009:0	Hurry and go up to my father , and say to him , ‘Thus says your son Joseph , “ God has made me lord of all Egypt ; come down to me , do not delay .
1:45:010:0	You shall live in the land of Goshen , and you shall be near me , you and your children and your children’s children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have .
1:45:011:0	There I will also provide for you , for there are still five years of famine to come , and you and your household and all that you have would be impoverished . ” ’
1:45:012:0	Behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see , that it is my mouth which is speaking to you .
1:45:013:0	Now you must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt , and all that you have seen ; and you must hurry and bring my father down here . ”
1:45:014:0	Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept , and Benjamin wept on his neck .
1:45:015:0	He kissed all his brothers and wept on them , and afterward his brothers talked with him .
1:45:016:0	Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come , it pleased Pharaoh and his servants .
1:45:017:0	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Say to your brothers , ‘Do this : load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan ,
1:45:018:0	and take your father and your households and come to me , and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat of the land . ’
1:45:019:0	Now you are ordered , ‘Do this : take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives , and bring your father and come .
1:45:020:0	Do not concern yourselves with your goods , for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours . ’ ”
1:45:021:0	Then the sons of Israel did so ; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh , and gave them provisions for the journey .
1:45:022:0	To each of them he gave changes of garments , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments .
1:45:023:0	To his father he sent as follows : ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey .
1:45:024:0	So he sent his brothers away , and as they departed , he said to them , “ Do not quarrel on the journey . ”
1:45:025:0	Then they went up from Egypt , and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob .
1:45:026:0	They told him , saying , “ Joseph is still alive , and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt . ” But he was stunned , for he did not believe them .
1:45:027:0	When they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them , and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of their father Jacob revived .
1:45:028:0	Then Israel said , “ It is enough ; my son Joseph is still alive . I will go and see him before I die . ”
