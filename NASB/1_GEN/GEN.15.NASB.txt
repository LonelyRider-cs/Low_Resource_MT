1:15:001:1	Abram Promised a Son
1:15:001:0	After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision , saying , “ Do not fear , Abram , I am a shield to you ; Your reward shall be very great . ”
1:15:002:0	Abram said , “ O Lord God , what will You give me , since I am childless , and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus ? ”
1:15:003:0	And Abram said , “ Since You have given no offspring to me , one born in my house is my heir . ”
1:15:004:0	Then behold , the word of the Lord came to him , saying , “ This man will not be your heir ; but one who will come forth from your own body , he shall be your heir . ”
1:15:005:0	And He took him outside and said , “ Now look toward the heavens , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . ” And He said to him , “ So shall your descendants be . ”
1:15:006:0	Then he believed in the Lord ; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness .
1:15:007:0	And He said to him , “ I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans , to give you this land to possess it . ”
1:15:008:0	He said , “ O Lord God , how may I know that I will possess it ? ”
1:15:009:0	So He said to him , “ Bring Me a three year old heifer , and a three year old female goat , and a three year old ram , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon . ”
1:15:010:0	Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he did not cut the birds .
1:15:011:0	The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away .
1:15:012:0	Now when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and behold , terror and great darkness fell upon him .
1:15:013:0	God said to Abram , “ Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs , where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years .
1:15:014:0	But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve , and afterward they will come out with many possessions .
1:15:015:0	As for you , you shall go to your fathers in peace ; you will be buried at a good old age .
1:15:016:0	Then in the fourth generation they will return here , for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete . ”
1:15:017:0	It came about when the sun had set , that it was very dark , and behold , there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces .
1:15:018:0	On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram , saying , “ To your descendants I have given this land , From the river of Egypt as far as the great river , the river Euphrates :
1:15:019:0	the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
1:15:020:0	and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
1:15:021:0	and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite . ”
