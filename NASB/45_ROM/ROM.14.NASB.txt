45:14:001:1	Principles of Conscience
45:14:001:0	Now accept the one who is weak in faith , but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions .
45:14:002:0	One person has faith that he may eat all things , but he who is weak eats vegetables only .
45:14:003:0	The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat , and the one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats , for God has accepted him .
45:14:004:0	Who are you to judge the servant of another ? To his own master he stands or falls ; and he will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
45:14:005:0	One person regards one day above another , another regards every day alike . Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind .
45:14:006:0	He who observes the day , observes it for the Lord , and he who eats , does so for the Lord , for he gives thanks to God ; and he who eats not , for the Lord he does not eat , and gives thanks to God .
45:14:007:0	For not one of us lives for himself , and not one dies for himself ;
45:14:008:0	for if we live , we live for the Lord , or if we die , we die for the Lord ; therefore whether we live or die , we are the Lord’s .
45:14:009:0	For to this end Christ died and lived again , that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
45:14:010:0	But you , why do you judge your brother ? Or you again , why do you regard your brother with contempt ? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God .
45:14:011:0	For it is written , “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to Me , And every tongue shall give praise to God . ”
45:14:012:0	So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God .
45:14:013:0	Therefore let us not judge one another anymore , but rather determine this—not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother’s way .
45:14:014:0	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself ; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
45:14:015:0	For if because of food your brother is hurt , you are no longer walking according to love . Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died .
45:14:016:0	Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil ;
45:14:017:0	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45:14:018:0	For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men .
45:14:019:0	So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another .
45:14:020:0	Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food . All things indeed are clean , but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense .
45:14:021:0	It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine , or to do anything by which your brother stumbles .
45:14:022:0	The faith which you have , have as your own conviction before God . Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves .
45:14:023:0	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats , because his eating is not from faith ; and whatever is not from faith is sin .
