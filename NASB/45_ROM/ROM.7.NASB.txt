45:7:001:1	Believers United to Christ
45:7:001:0	Or do you not know , brethren ( for I am speaking to those who know the law ) , that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives ?
45:7:002:0	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living ; but if her husband dies , she is released from the law concerning the husband .
45:7:003:0	So then , if while her husband is living she is joined to another man , she shall be called an adulteress ; but if her husband dies , she is free from the law , so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man .
45:7:004:0	Therefore , my brethren , you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ , so that you might be joined to another , to Him who was raised from the dead , in order that we might bear fruit for God .
45:7:005:0	For while we were in the flesh , the sinful passions , which were aroused by the Law , were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death .
45:7:006:0	But now we have been released from the Law , having died to that by which we were bound , so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter .
45:7:007:0	What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? May it never be ! On the contrary , I would not have come to know sin except through the Law ; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said , “ You shall not covet . ”
45:7:008:0	But sin , taking opportunity through the commandment , produced in me coveting of every kind ; for apart from the Law sin is dead .
45:7:009:0	I was once alive apart from the Law ; but when the commandment came , sin became alive and I died ;
45:7:010:0	and this commandment , which was to result in life , proved to result in death for me ;
45:7:011:0	for sin , taking an opportunity through the commandment , deceived me and through it killed me .
45:7:012:0	So then , the Law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
45:7:002:1	The Conflict of Two Natures
45:7:013:0	Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me ? May it never be ! Rather it was sin , in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good , so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful .
45:7:014:0	For we know that the Law is spiritual , but I am of flesh , sold into bondage to sin .
45:7:015:0	For what I am doing , I do not understand ; for I am not practicing what I would like to do , but I am doing the very thing I hate .
45:7:016:0	But if I do the very thing I do not want to do , I agree with the Law , confessing that the Law is good .
45:7:017:0	So now , no longer am I the one doing it , but sin which dwells in me .
45:7:018:0	For I know that nothing good dwells in me , that is , in my flesh ; for the willing is present in me , but the doing of the good is not .
45:7:019:0	For the good that I want , I do not do , but I practice the very evil that I do not want .
45:7:020:0	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want , I am no longer the one doing it , but sin which dwells in me .
45:7:021:0	I find then the principle that evil is present in me , the one who wants to do good .
45:7:022:0	For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man ,
45:7:023:0	but I see a different law in the members of my body , waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members .
45:7:024:0	Wretched man that I am ! Who will set me free from the body of this death ?
45:7:025:0	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God , but on the other , with my flesh the law of sin .
