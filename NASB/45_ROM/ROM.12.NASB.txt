45:12:001:1	Dedicated Service
45:12:001:0	Therefore I urge you , brethren , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service of worship .
45:12:002:0	And do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may prove what the will of God is , that which is good and acceptable and perfect .
45:12:003:0	For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think ; but to think so as to have sound judgment , as God has allotted to each a measure of faith .
45:12:004:0	For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function ,
45:12:005:0	so we , who are many , are one body in Christ , and individually members one of another .
45:12:006:0	Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us , each of us is to exercise them accordingly : if prophecy , according to the proportion of his faith ;
45:12:007:0	if service , in his serving ; or he who teaches , in his teaching ;
45:12:008:0	or he who exhorts , in his exhortation ; he who gives , with liberality ; he who leads , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheerfulness .
45:12:009:0	Let love be without hypocrisy . Abhor what is evil ; cling to what is good .
45:12:010:0	Be devoted to one another in brotherly love ; give preference to one another in honor ;
45:12:011:0	not lagging behind in diligence , fervent in spirit , serving the Lord ;
45:12:012:0	rejoicing in hope , persevering in tribulation , devoted to prayer ,
45:12:013:0	contributing to the needs of the saints , practicing hospitality .
45:12:014:0	Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse .
45:12:015:0	Rejoice with those who rejoice , and weep with those who weep .
45:12:016:0	Be of the same mind toward one another ; do not be haughty in mind , but associate with the lowly . Do not be wise in your own estimation .
45:12:017:0	Never pay back evil for evil to anyone . Respect what is right in the sight of all men .
45:12:018:0	If possible , so far as it depends on you , be at peace with all men .
45:12:019:0	Never take your own revenge , beloved , but leave room for the wrath of God , for it is written , “ Vengeance is Mine , I will repay , ” says the Lord .
45:12:020:0	“ But if your enemy is hungry , feed him , and if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head . ”
45:12:021:0	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
