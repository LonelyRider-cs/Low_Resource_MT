45:8:001:1	Deliverance from Bondage
45:8:001:0	Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus .
45:8:002:0	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death .
45:8:003:0	For what the Law could not do , weak as it was through the flesh , God did : sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin , He condemned sin in the flesh ,
45:8:004:0	so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us , who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
45:8:005:0	For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who are according to the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
45:8:006:0	For the mind set on the flesh is death , but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace ,
45:8:007:0	because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God ; for it does not subject itself to the law of God , for it is not even able to do so ,
45:8:008:0	and those who are in the flesh cannot please God .
45:8:009:0	However , you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you . But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , he does not belong to Him .
45:8:010:0	If Christ is in you , though the body is dead because of sin , yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness .
45:8:011:0	But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you .
45:8:012:0	So then , brethren , we are under obligation , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh—
45:8:013:0	for if you are living according to the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
45:8:014:0	For all who are being led by the Spirit of God , these are sons of God .
45:8:015:0	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again , but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
45:8:016:0	The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God ,
45:8:017:0	and if children , heirs also , heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him .
45:8:018:0	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us .
45:8:019:0	For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God .
45:8:020:0	For the creation was subjected to futility , not willingly , but because of Him who subjected it , in hope
45:8:021:0	that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God .
45:8:022:0	For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now .
45:8:023:0	And not only this , but also we ourselves , having the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons , the redemption of our body .
45:8:024:0	For in hope we have been saved , but hope that is seen is not hope ; for who hopes for what he already sees ?
45:8:002:1	Our Victory in Christ
45:8:025:0	But if we hope for what we do not see , with perseverance we wait eagerly for it .
45:8:026:0	In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness ; for we do not know how to pray as we should , but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words ;
45:8:027:0	and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is , because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God .
45:8:028:0	And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God , to those who are called according to His purpose .
45:8:029:0	For those whom He foreknew , He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son , so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren ;
45:8:030:0	and these whom He predestined , He also called ; and these whom He called , He also justified ; and these whom He justified , He also glorified .
45:8:031:0	What then shall we say to these things ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
45:8:032:0	He who did not spare His own Son , but delivered Him over for us all , how will He not also with Him freely give us all things ?
45:8:033:0	Who will bring a charge against God’s elect ? God is the one who justifies ;
45:8:034:0	who is the one who condemns ? Christ Jesus is He who died , yes , rather who was raised , who is at the right hand of God , who also intercedes for us .
45:8:035:0	Who will separate us from the love of Christ ? Will tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
45:8:036:0	Just as it is written , “ For Your sake we are being put to death all day long ; We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered . ”
45:8:037:0	But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us .
45:8:038:0	For I am convinced that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor things present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
45:8:039:0	nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
