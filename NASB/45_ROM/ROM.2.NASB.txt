45:2:001:1	The Impartiality of God
45:2:001:0	Therefore you have no excuse , everyone of you who passes judgment , for in that which you judge another , you condemn yourself ; for you who judge practice the same things .
45:2:002:0	And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things .
45:2:003:0	But do you suppose this , O man , when you pass judgment on those who practice such things and do the same yourself , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
45:2:004:0	Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience , not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance ?
45:2:005:0	But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,
45:2:006:0	who will render to each person according to his deeds :
45:2:007:0	to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality , eternal life ;
45:2:008:0	but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , wrath and indignation .
45:2:009:0	There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil , of the Jew first and also of the Greek ,
45:2:010:0	but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45:2:011:0	For there is no partiality with God .
45:2:012:0	For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law , and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law ;
45:2:013:0	for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God , but the doers of the Law will be justified .
45:2:014:0	For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law , these , not having the Law , are a law to themselves ,
45:2:015:0	in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts , their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them ,
45:2:002:1	The Jew Is Condemned by the Law
45:2:016:0	on the day when , according to my gospel , God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus .
45:2:017:0	But if you bear the name “ Jew ” and rely upon the Law and boast in God ,
45:2:018:0	and know His will and approve the things that are essential , being instructed out of the Law ,
45:2:019:0	and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45:2:020:0	a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of the immature , having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth ,
45:2:021:0	you , therefore , who teach another , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach that one shall not steal , do you steal ?
45:2:022:0	You who say that one should not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45:2:023:0	You who boast in the Law , through your breaking the Law , do you dishonor God ?
45:2:024:0	For “ the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , ” just as it is written .
45:2:025:0	For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law ; but if you are a transgressor of the Law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45:2:026:0	So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision ?
45:2:027:0	And he who is physically uncircumcised , if he keeps the Law , will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law ?
45:2:028:0	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly , nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh .
45:2:029:0	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that which is of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the letter ; and his praise is not from men , but from God .
