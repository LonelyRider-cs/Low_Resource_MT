45:4:001:1	Justification by Faith Evidenced in Old Testament
45:4:001:0	What then shall we say that Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh , has found ?
45:4:002:0	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not before God .
45:4:003:0	For what does the Scripture say ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . ”
45:4:004:0	Now to the one who works , his wage is not credited as a favor , but as what is due .
45:4:005:0	But to the one who does not work , but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited as righteousness ,
45:4:006:0	just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
45:4:007:0	“ Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven , And whose sins have been covered .
45:4:008:0	Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account . ”
45:4:009:0	Is this blessing then on the circumcised , or on the uncircumcised also ? For we say , “ Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness . ”
45:4:010:0	How then was it credited ? While he was circumcised , or uncircumcised ? Not while circumcised , but while uncircumcised ;
45:4:011:0	and he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised , so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised , that righteousness might be credited to them ,
45:4:012:0	and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised .
45:4:013:0	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law , but through the righteousness of faith .
45:4:014:0	For if those who are of the Law are heirs , faith is made void and the promise is nullified ;
45:4:015:0	for the Law brings about wrath , but where there is no law , there also is no violation .
45:4:016:0	For this reason it is by faith , in order that it may be in accordance with grace , so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants , not only to those who are of the Law , but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all ,
45:4:017:0	( as it is written , “ A father of many nations have I made you ” ) in the presence of Him whom he believed , even God , who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist .
45:4:018:0	In hope against hope he believed , so that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken , “ So shall your descendants be . ”
45:4:019:0	Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body , now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old , and the deadness of Sarah’s womb ;
45:4:020:0	yet , with respect to the promise of God , he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith , giving glory to God ,
45:4:021:0	and being fully assured that what God had promised , He was able also to perform .
45:4:022:0	Therefore it was also credited to him as righteousness .
45:4:023:0	Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him ,
45:4:024:0	but for our sake also , to whom it will be credited , as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
45:4:025:0	He who was delivered over because of our transgressions , and was raised because of our justification .
