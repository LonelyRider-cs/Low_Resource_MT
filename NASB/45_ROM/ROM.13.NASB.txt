45:13:001:1	Be Subject to Government
45:13:001:0	Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities . For there is no authority except from God , and those which exist are established by God .
45:13:002:0	Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God ; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves .
45:13:003:0	For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior , but for evil . Do you want to have no fear of authority ? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same ;
45:13:004:0	for it is a minister of God to you for good . But if you do what is evil , be afraid ; for it does not bear the sword for nothing ; for it is a minister of God , an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil .
45:13:005:0	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection , not only because of wrath , but also for conscience’ sake .
45:13:006:0	For because of this you also pay taxes , for rulers are servants of God , devoting themselves to this very thing .
45:13:007:0	Render to all what is due them : tax to whom tax is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honor to whom honor .
45:13:008:0	Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
45:13:009:0	For this , “ You shall not commit adultery , You shall not murder , You shall not steal , You shall not covet , ” and if there is any other commandment , it is summed up in this saying , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
45:13:010:0	Love does no wrong to a neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
45:13:011:0	Do this , knowing the time , that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep ; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed .
45:13:012:0	The night is almost gone , and the day is near . Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light .
45:13:013:0	Let us behave properly as in the day , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality , not in strife and jealousy .
45:13:014:0	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts .
