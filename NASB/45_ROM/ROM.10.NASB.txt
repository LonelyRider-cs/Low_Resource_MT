45:10:001:1	The Word of Faith Brings Salvation
45:10:001:0	Brethren , my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation .
45:10:002:0	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God , but not in accordance with knowledge .
45:10:003:0	For not knowing about God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own , they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
45:10:004:0	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes .
45:10:005:0	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness .
45:10:006:0	But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows : “ Do not say in your heart , ‘Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ,
45:10:007:0	or ‘Who will descend into the abyss ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) . ”
45:10:008:0	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” —that is , the word of faith which we are preaching ,
45:10:009:0	that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved ;
45:10:010:0	for with the heart a person believes , resulting in righteousness , and with the mouth he confesses , resulting in salvation .
45:10:011:0	For the Scripture says , “ Whoever believes in Him will not be disappointed . ”
45:10:012:0	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , abounding in riches for all who call on Him ;
45:10:013:0	for “ Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved . ”
45:10:014:0	How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed ? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard ? And how will they hear without a preacher ?
45:10:015:0	How will they preach unless they are sent ? Just as it is written , “ How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things ! ”
45:10:016:0	However , they did not all heed the good news ; for Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our report ? ”
45:10:017:0	So faith comes from hearing , and hearing by the word of Christ .
45:10:018:0	But I say , surely they have never heard , have they ? Indeed they have ; “ Their voice has gone out into all the earth , And their words to the ends of the world . ”
45:10:019:0	But I say , surely Israel did not know , did they ? First Moses says , “ I will make you jealous by that which is not a nation , By a nation without understanding will I anger you . ”
45:10:020:0	And Isaiah is very bold and says , “ I was found by those who did not seek Me , I became manifest to those who did not ask for Me . ”
45:10:021:0	But as for Israel He says , “ All the day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people . ”
