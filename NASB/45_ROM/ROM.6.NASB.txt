45:6:001:1	Believers Are Dead to Sin , Alive to God
45:6:001:0	What shall we say then ? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase ?
45:6:002:0	May it never be ! How shall we who died to sin still live in it ?
45:6:003:0	Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death ?
45:6:004:0	Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death , so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we too might walk in newness of life .
45:6:005:0	For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death , certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection ,
45:6:006:0	knowing this , that our old self was crucified with Him , in order that our body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be slaves to sin ;
45:6:007:0	for he who has died is freed from sin .
45:6:008:0	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
45:6:009:0	knowing that Christ , having been raised from the dead , is never to die again ; death no longer is master over Him .
45:6:010:0	For the death that He died , He died to sin once for all ; but the life that He lives , He lives to God .
45:6:011:0	Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
45:6:012:0	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts ,
45:6:013:0	and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness ; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness to God .
45:6:014:0	For sin shall not be master over you , for you are not under law but under grace .
45:6:015:0	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? May it never be !
45:6:016:0	Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience , you are slaves of the one whom you obey , either of sin resulting in death , or of obedience resulting in righteousness ?
45:6:017:0	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed ,
45:6:018:0	and having been freed from sin , you became slaves of righteousness .
45:6:019:0	I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness , resulting in further lawlessness , so now present your members as slaves to righteousness , resulting in sanctification .
45:6:020:0	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
45:6:021:0	Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the outcome of those things is death .
45:6:022:0	But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God , you derive your benefit , resulting in sanctification , and the outcome , eternal life .
45:6:023:0	For the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
