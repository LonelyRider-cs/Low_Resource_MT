45:1:001:1	The Gospel Exalted
45:1:001:0	Paul , a bond-servant of Christ Jesus , called as an apostle , set apart for the gospel of God ,
45:1:002:0	which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures ,
45:1:003:0	concerning His Son , who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh ,
45:1:004:0	who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead , according to the Spirit of holiness , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
45:1:005:0	through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name’s sake ,
45:1:006:0	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ ;
45:1:007:0	to all who are beloved of God in Rome , called as saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45:1:008:0	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world .
45:1:009:0	For God , whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of His Son , is my witness as to how unceasingly I make mention of you ,
45:1:010:0	always in my prayers making request , if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you .
45:1:011:0	For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift to you , that you may be established ;
45:1:012:0	that is , that I may be encouraged together with you while among you , each of us by the other’s faith , both yours and mine .
45:1:013:0	I do not want you to be unaware , brethren , that often I have planned to come to you ( and have been prevented so far ) so that I may obtain some fruit among you also , even as among the rest of the Gentiles .
45:1:014:0	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians , both to the wise and to the foolish .
45:1:015:0	So , for my part , I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome .
45:1:016:0	For I am not ashamed of the gospel , for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45:1:002:1	Unbelief and Its Consequences
45:1:017:0	For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith ; as it is written , “ But the righteous man shall live by faith . ”
45:1:018:0	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
45:1:019:0	because that which is known about God is evident within them ; for God made it evident to them .
45:1:020:0	For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes , His eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly seen , being understood through what has been made , so that they are without excuse .
45:1:021:0	For even though they knew God , they did not honor Him as God or give thanks , but they became futile in their speculations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
45:1:022:0	Professing to be wise , they became fools ,
45:1:023:0	and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures .
45:1:024:0	Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , so that their bodies would be dishonored among them .
45:1:025:0	For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
45:1:026:0	For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions ; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural ,
45:1:027:0	and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another , men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error .
45:1:028:0	And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer , God gave them over to a depraved mind , to do those things which are not proper ,
45:1:029:0	being filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , greed , evil ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malice ; they are gossips ,
45:1:030:0	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boastful , inventors of evil , disobedient to parents ,
45:1:031:0	without understanding , untrustworthy , unloving , unmerciful ;
45:1:032:0	and although they know the ordinance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , they not only do the same , but also give hearty approval to those who practice them .
