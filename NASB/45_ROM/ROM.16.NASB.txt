45:16:001:1	Greetings and Love Expressed
45:16:001:0	I commend to you our sister Phoebe , who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea ;
45:16:002:0	that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints , and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you ; for she herself has also been a helper of many , and of myself as well .
45:16:003:0	Greet Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45:16:004:0	who for my life risked their own necks , to whom not only do I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles ;
45:16:005:0	also greet the church that is in their house . Greet Epaenetus , my beloved , who is the first convert to Christ from Asia .
45:16:006:0	Greet Mary , who has worked hard for you .
45:16:007:0	Greet Andronicus and Junias , my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners , who are outstanding among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
45:16:008:0	Greet Ampliatus , my beloved in the Lord .
45:16:009:0	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and Stachys my beloved .
45:16:010:0	Greet Apelles , the approved in Christ . Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus .
45:16:011:0	Greet Herodion , my kinsman . Greet those of the household of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
45:16:012:0	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , workers in the Lord . Greet Persis the beloved , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45:16:013:0	Greet Rufus , a choice man in the Lord , also his mother and mine .
45:16:014:0	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas and the brethren with them .
45:16:015:0	Greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45:16:016:0	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ greet you .
45:16:017:0	Now I urge you , brethren , keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned , and turn away from them .
45:16:018:0	For such men are slaves , not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites ; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting .
45:16:019:0	For the report of your obedience has reached to all ; therefore I am rejoicing over you , but I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil .
45:16:020:0	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
45:16:021:0	Timothy my fellow worker greets you , and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my kinsmen .
45:16:022:0	I , Tertius , who write this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45:16:023:0	Gaius , host to me and to the whole church , greets you . Erastus , the city treasurer greets you , and Quartus , the brother .
45:16:024:0	[ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen . ]
45:16:025:0	Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past ,
45:16:026:0	but now is manifested , and by the Scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the eternal God , has been made known to all the nations , leading to obedience of faith ;
45:16:027:0	to the only wise God , through Jesus Christ , be the glory forever . Amen .
