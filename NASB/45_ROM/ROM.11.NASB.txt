45:11:001:1	Israel Is Not Cast Away
45:11:001:0	I say then , God has not rejected His people , has He ? May it never be ! For I too am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
45:11:002:0	God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew . Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
45:11:003:0	“ Lord , they have killed Your prophets , they have torn down Your altars , and I alone am left , and they are seeking my life . ”
45:11:004:0	But what is the divine response to him ? “ I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal . ”
45:11:005:0	In the same way then , there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God’s gracious choice .
45:11:006:0	But if it is by grace , it is no longer on the basis of works , otherwise grace is no longer grace .
45:11:007:0	What then ? What Israel is seeking , it has not obtained , but those who were chosen obtained it , and the rest were hardened ;
45:11:008:0	just as it is written , “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , Eyes to see not and ears to hear not , Down to this very day . ”
45:11:009:0	And David says , “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , And a stumbling block and a retribution to them .
45:11:010:0	Let their eyes be darkened to see not , And bend their backs forever . ”
45:11:011:0	I say then , they did not stumble so as to fall , did they ? May it never be ! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles , to make them jealous .
45:11:012:0	Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their fulfillment be !
45:11:013:0	But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles , I magnify my ministry ,
45:11:014:0	if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them .
45:11:015:0	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
45:11:016:0	If the first piece of dough is holy , the lump is also ; and if the root is holy , the branches are too .
45:11:017:0	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you , being a wild olive , were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree ,
45:11:018:0	do not be arrogant toward the branches ; but if you are arrogant , remember that it is not you who supports the root , but the root supports you .
45:11:019:0	You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in . ”
45:11:020:0	Quite right , they were broken off for their unbelief , but you stand by your faith . Do not be conceited , but fear ;
45:11:021:0	for if God did not spare the natural branches , He will not spare you , either .
45:11:022:0	Behold then the kindness and severity of God ; to those who fell , severity , but to you , God’s kindness , if you continue in His kindness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
45:11:023:0	And they also , if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
45:11:024:0	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree ?
45:11:025:0	For I do not want you , brethren , to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in ;
45:11:026:0	and so all Israel will be saved ; just as it is written , “ The Deliverer will come from Zion , He will remove ungodliness from Jacob . ”
45:11:027:0	“ This is My covenant with them , When I take away their sins . ”
45:11:028:0	From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake , but from the standpoint of God’s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers ;
45:11:029:0	for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable .
45:11:030:0	For just as you once were disobedient to God , but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience ,
45:11:031:0	so these also now have been disobedient , that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy .
45:11:032:0	For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all .
45:11:033:0	Oh , the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways !
45:11:034:0	For who has known the mind of the Lord , or who became His counselor ?
45:11:035:0	Or who has first given to Him that it might be paid back to him again ?
45:11:036:0	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things . To Him be the glory forever . Amen .
