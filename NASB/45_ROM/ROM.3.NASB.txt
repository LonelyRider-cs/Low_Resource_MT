45:3:001:1	All the World Guilty
45:3:001:0	Then what advantage has the Jew ? Or what is the benefit of circumcision ?
45:3:002:0	Great in every respect . First of all , that they were entrusted with the oracles of God .
45:3:003:0	What then ? If some did not believe , their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God , will it ?
45:3:004:0	May it never be ! Rather , let God be found true , though every man be found a liar , as it is written , “ That You may be justified in Your words , And prevail when You are judged . ”
45:3:005:0	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous , is He ? ( I am speaking in human terms . )
45:3:006:0	May it never be ! For otherwise , how will God judge the world ?
45:3:007:0	But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory , why am I also still being judged as a sinner ?
45:3:008:0	And why not say ( as we are slanderously reported and as some claim that we say ) , “ Let us do evil that good may come ” ? Their condemnation is just .
45:3:009:0	What then ? Are we better than they ? Not at all ; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin ;
45:3:010:0	as it is written , “ There is none righteous , not even one ;
45:3:011:0	There is none who understands , There is none who seeks for God ;
45:3:012:0	All have turned aside , together they have become useless ; There is none who does good , There is not even one . ”
45:3:013:0	“ Their throat is an open grave , With their tongues they keep deceiving , ” “ The poison of asps is under their lips ” ;
45:3:014:0	“ Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness ” ;
45:3:015:0	“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ,
45:3:016:0	Destruction and misery are in their paths ,
45:3:017:0	And the path of peace they have not known . ”
45:3:018:0	“ There is no fear of God before their eyes . ”
45:3:019:0	Now we know that whatever the Law says , it speaks to those who are under the Law , so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God ;
45:3:002:1	Justification by Faith
45:3:020:0	because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight ; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin .
45:3:021:0	But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested , being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets ,
45:3:022:0	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe ; for there is no distinction ;
45:3:023:0	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
45:3:024:0	being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus ;
45:3:025:0	whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith . This was to demonstrate His righteousness , because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed ;
45:3:026:0	for the demonstration , I say , of His righteousness at the present time , so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus .
45:3:027:0	Where then is boasting ? It is excluded . By what kind of law ? Of works ? No , but by a law of faith .
45:3:028:0	For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law .
45:3:029:0	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is He not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
45:3:030:0	since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one .
45:3:031:0	Do we then nullify the Law through faith ? May it never be ! On the contrary , we establish the Law .
