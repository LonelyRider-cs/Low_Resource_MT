45:9:001:1	Solicitude for Israel
45:9:001:0	I am telling the truth in Christ , I am not lying , my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit ,
45:9:002:0	that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart .
45:9:003:0	For I could wish that I myself were accursed , separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh ,
45:9:004:0	who are Israelites , to whom belongs the adoption as sons , and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises ,
45:9:005:0	whose are the fathers , and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh , who is over all , God blessed forever . Amen .
45:9:006:0	But it is not as though the word of God has failed . For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel ;
45:9:007:0	nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants , but : “ through Isaac your descendants will be named . ”
45:9:008:0	That is , it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God , but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants .
45:9:009:0	For this is the word of promise : “ At this time I will come , and Sarah shall have a son . ”
45:9:010:0	And not only this , but there was Rebekah also , when she had conceived twins by one man , our father Isaac ;
45:9:011:0	for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad , so that God’s purpose according to His choice would stand , not because of works but because of Him who calls ,
45:9:012:0	it was said to her , “ The older will serve the younger . ”
45:9:013:0	Just as it is written , “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . ”
45:9:014:0	What shall we say then ? There is no injustice with God , is there ? May it never be !
45:9:015:0	For He says to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . ”
45:9:016:0	So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs , but on God who has mercy .
45:9:017:0	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ For this very purpose I raised you up , to demonstrate My power in you , and that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth . ”
45:9:018:0	So then He has mercy on whom He desires , and He hardens whom He desires .
45:9:019:0	You will say to me then , “ Why does He still find fault ? For who resists His will ? ”
45:9:020:0	On the contrary , who are you , O man , who answers back to God ? The thing molded will not say to the molder , “ Why did you make me like this , ” will it ?
45:9:021:0	Or does not the potter have a right over the clay , to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use ?
45:9:022:0	What if God , although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction ?
45:9:023:0	And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy , which He prepared beforehand for glory ,
45:9:024:0	even us , whom He also called , not from among Jews only , but also from among Gentiles .
45:9:025:0	As He says also in Hosea , “ I will call those who were not My people , ‘My people , ’And her who was not beloved , ‘beloved . ’ ”
45:9:026:0	“ And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them , ‘you are not My people , ’There they shall be called sons of the living God . ”
45:9:027:0	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel , “ Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea , it is the remnant that will be saved ;
45:9:028:0	for the Lord will execute His word on the earth , thoroughly and quickly . ”
45:9:029:0	And just as Isaiah foretold , “ Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left to us a posterity , We would have become like Sodom , and would have resembled Gomorrah . ”
45:9:030:0	What shall we say then ? That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , attained righteousness , even the righteousness which is by faith ;
45:9:031:0	but Israel , pursuing a law of righteousness , did not arrive at that law .
45:9:032:0	Why ? Because they did not pursue it by faith , but as though it were by works . They stumbled over the stumbling stone ,
45:9:033:0	just as it is written , “ Behold , I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense , And he who believes in Him will not be disappointed . ”
