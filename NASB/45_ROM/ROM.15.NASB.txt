45:15:001:1	Self-denial on Behalf of Others
45:15:001:0	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves .
45:15:002:0	Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good , to his edification .
45:15:003:0	For even Christ did not please Himself ; but as it is written , “ The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me . ”
45:15:004:0	For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction , so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
45:15:005:0	Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus ,
45:15:006:0	so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45:15:007:0	Therefore , accept one another , just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God .
45:15:008:0	For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers ,
45:15:009:0	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy ; as it is written , “ Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles , And I will sing to Your name . ”
45:15:010:0	Again he says , “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with His people . ”
45:15:011:0	And again , “ Praise the Lord all you Gentiles , And let all the peoples praise Him . ”
45:15:012:0	Again Isaiah says , “ There shall come the root of Jesse , And He who arises to rule over the Gentiles , In Him shall the Gentiles hope . ”
45:15:013:0	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit .
45:15:014:0	And concerning you , my brethren , I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish one another .
45:15:015:0	But I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again , because of the grace that was given me from God ,
45:15:016:0	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , ministering as a priest the gospel of God , so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45:15:017:0	Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God .
45:15:018:0	For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me , resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed ,
45:15:019:0	in the power of signs and wonders , in the power of the Spirit ; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
45:15:020:0	And thus I aspired to preach the gospel , not where Christ was already named , so that I would not build on another man’s foundation ;
45:15:021:0	but as it is written , “ They who had no news of Him shall see , And they who have not heard shall understand . ”
45:15:022:0	For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you ;
45:15:023:0	but now , with no further place for me in these regions , and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you
45:15:024:0	whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing , and to be helped on my way there by you , when I have first enjoyed your company for a while—
45:15:025:0	but now , I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints .
45:15:026:0	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem .
45:15:027:0	Yes , they were pleased to do so , and they are indebted to them . For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things , they are indebted to minister to them also in material things .
45:15:028:0	Therefore , when I have finished this , and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
45:15:029:0	I know that when I come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
45:15:030:0	Now I urge you , brethren , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
45:15:031:0	that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea , and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints ;
45:15:032:0	so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company .
45:15:033:0	Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
