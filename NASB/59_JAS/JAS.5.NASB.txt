59:5:001:1	Misuse of Riches
59:5:001:0	Come now , you rich , weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you .
59:5:002:0	Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten .
59:5:003:0	Your gold and your silver have rusted ; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire . It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure !
59:5:004:0	Behold , the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields , and which has been withheld by you , cries out against you ; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth .
59:5:005:0	You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure ; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
59:5:002:1	Exhortation
59:5:006:0	You have condemned and put to death the righteous man ; he does not resist you .
59:5:007:0	Therefore be patient , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil , being patient about it , until it gets the early and late rains .
59:5:008:0	You too be patient ; strengthen your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is near .
59:5:009:0	Do not complain , brethren , against one another , so that you yourselves may not be judged ; behold , the Judge is standing right at the door .
59:5:010:0	As an example , brethren , of suffering and patience , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59:5:011:0	We count those blessed who endured . You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lordâ€™s dealings , that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful .
59:5:012:0	But above all , my brethren , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath ; but your yes is to be yes , and your no , no , so that you may not fall under judgment .
59:5:013:0	Is anyone among you suffering ? Then he must pray . Is anyone cheerful ? He is to sing praises .
59:5:014:0	Is anyone among you sick ? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ;
59:5:015:0	and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up , and if he has committed sins , they will be forgiven him .
59:5:016:0	Therefore , confess your sins to one another , and pray for one another so that you may be healed . The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much .
59:5:017:0	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months .
59:5:018:0	Then he prayed again , and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit .
59:5:019:0	My brethren , if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back ,
59:5:020:0	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins .
