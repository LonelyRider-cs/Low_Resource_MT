59:2:001:1	The Sin of Partiality
59:2:001:0	My brethren , do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism .
59:2:002:0	For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes , and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes ,
59:2:003:0	and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes , and say , “ You sit here in a good place , ” and you say to the poor man , “ You stand over there , or sit down by my footstool , ”
59:2:004:0	have you not made distinctions among yourselves , and become judges with evil motives ?
59:2:005:0	Listen , my beloved brethren : did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him ?
59:2:006:0	But you have dishonored the poor man . Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court ?
59:2:007:0	Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called ?
59:2:008:0	If , however , you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well .
59:2:009:0	But if you show partiality , you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors .
59:2:010:0	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point , he has become guilty of all .
59:2:011:0	For He who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not commit murder . ” Now if you do not commit adultery , but do commit murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
59:2:012:0	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty .
59:2:002:1	Faith and Works
59:2:013:0	For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy ; mercy triumphs over judgment .
59:2:014:0	What use is it , my brethren , if someone says he has faith but he has no works ? Can that faith save him ?
59:2:015:0	If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food ,
59:2:016:0	and one of you says to them , “ Go in peace , be warmed and be filled , ” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body , what use is that ?
59:2:017:0	Even so faith , if it has no works , is dead , being by itself .
59:2:018:0	But someone may well say , “ You have faith and I have works ; show me your faith without the works , and I will show you my faith by my works . ”
59:2:019:0	You believe that God is one . You do well ; the demons also believe , and shudder .
59:2:020:0	But are you willing to recognize , you foolish fellow , that faith without works is useless ?
59:2:021:0	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
59:2:022:0	You see that faith was working with his works , and as a result of the works , faith was perfected ;
59:2:023:0	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , “ And Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness , ” and he was called the friend of God .
59:2:024:0	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone .
59:2:025:0	In the same way , was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way ?
59:2:026:0	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead .
