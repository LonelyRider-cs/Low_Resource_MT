59:4:001:1	Things to Avoid
59:4:001:0	What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you ? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members ?
59:4:002:0	You lust and do not have ; so you commit murder . You are envious and cannot obtain ; so you fight and quarrel . You do not have because you do not ask .
59:4:003:0	You ask and do not receive , because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it on your pleasures .
59:4:004:0	You adulteresses , do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God ? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
59:4:005:0	Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose : “ He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us ” ?
59:4:006:0	But He gives a greater grace . Therefore it says , “ God is opposed to the proud , but gives grace to the humble . ”
59:4:007:0	Submit therefore to God . Resist the devil and he will flee from you .
59:4:008:0	Draw near to God and He will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59:4:009:0	Be miserable and mourn and weep ; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom .
59:4:010:0	Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord , and He will exalt you .
59:4:011:0	Do not speak against one another , brethren . He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law ; but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it .
59:4:012:0	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge , the One who is able to save and to destroy ; but who are you who judge your neighbor ?
59:4:013:0	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city , and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit . ”
59:4:014:0	Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow . You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away .
59:4:015:0	Instead , you ought to say , “ If the Lord wills , we will live and also do this or that . ”
59:4:016:0	But as it is , you boast in your arrogance ; all such boasting is evil .
59:4:017:0	Therefore , to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it , to him it is sin .
