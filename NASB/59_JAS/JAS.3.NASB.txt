59:3:001:1	The Tongue Is a Fire
59:3:001:0	Let not many of you become teachers , my brethren , knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment .
59:3:002:0	For we all stumble in many ways . If anyone does not stumble in what he says , he is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body as well .
59:3:003:0	Now if we put the bits into the horsesâ€™ mouths so that they will obey us , we direct their entire body as well .
59:3:004:0	Look at the ships also , though they are so great and are driven by strong winds , are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires .
59:3:005:0	So also the tongue is a small part of the body , and yet it boasts of great things . See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire !
59:3:006:0	And the tongue is a fire , the very world of iniquity ; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body , and sets on fire the course of our life , and is set on fire by hell .
59:3:007:0	For every species of beasts and birds , of reptiles and creatures of the sea , is tamed and has been tamed by the human race .
59:3:008:0	But no one can tame the tongue ; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison .
59:3:009:0	With it we bless our Lord and Father , and with it we curse men , who have been made in the likeness of God ;
59:3:010:0	from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not to be this way .
59:3:011:0	Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water ?
59:3:002:1	Wisdom from Above
59:3:012:0	Can a fig tree , my brethren , produce olives , or a vine produce figs ? Nor can salt water produce fresh .
59:3:013:0	Who among you is wise and understanding ? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom .
59:3:014:0	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth .
59:3:015:0	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above , but is earthly , natural , demonic .
59:3:016:0	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there is disorder and every evil thing .
59:3:017:0	But the wisdom from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , reasonable , full of mercy and good fruits , unwavering , without hypocrisy .
59:3:018:0	And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
