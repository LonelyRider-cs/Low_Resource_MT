12:19:001:1	Isaiah Encourages Hezekiah
12:19:001:0	And when King Hezekiah heard it , he tore his clothes , covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the Lord .
12:19:002:0	Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
12:19:003:0	They said to him , “ Thus says Hezekiah , ‘This day is a day of distress , rebuke , and rejection ; for children have come to birth and there is no strength to deliver .
12:19:004:0	Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh , whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God , and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard . Therefore , offer a prayer for the remnant that is left . ’ ”
12:19:005:0	So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
12:19:006:0	Isaiah said to them , “ Thus you shall say to your master , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me .
12:19:002:1	Sennacherib Defies God
12:19:007:0	Behold , I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land . And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land . ” ’ ”
12:19:008:0	Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah , for he had heard that the king had left Lachish .
12:19:009:0	When he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush , “ Behold , he has come out to fight against you , ” he sent messengers again to Hezekiah saying ,
12:19:010:0	“ Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah , ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you saying , “ Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . ”
12:19:011:0	Behold , you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands , destroying them completely . So will you be spared ?
12:19:012:0	Did the gods of those nations which my fathers destroyed deliver them , even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar ?
12:19:003:1	Hezekiah’s Prayer
12:19:013:0	Where is the king of Hamath , the king of Arpad , the king of the city of Sepharvaim , and of Hena and Ivvah ? ’ ”
12:19:014:0	Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it , and he went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord .
12:19:015:0	Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said , “ O Lord , the God of Israel , who are enthroned above the cherubim , You are the God , You alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
12:19:016:0	Incline Your ear , O Lord , and hear ; open Your eyes , O Lord , and see ; and listen to the words of Sennacherib , which he has sent to reproach the living God .
12:19:017:0	Truly , O Lord , the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands
12:19:018:0	and have cast their gods into the fire , for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands , wood and stone . So they have destroyed them .
12:19:004:1	God’s Answer through Isaiah
12:19:019:0	Now , O Lord our God , I pray , deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone , O Lord , are God . ”
12:19:020:0	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria , I have heard you . ’
12:19:021:0	This is the word that the Lord has spoken against him : ‘She has despised you and mocked you , The virgin daughter of Zion ; She has shaken her head behind you , The daughter of Jerusalem !
12:19:022:0	Whom have you reproached and blasphemed ? And against whom have you raised your voice , And haughtily lifted up your eyes ? Against the Holy One of Israel !
12:19:023:0	Through your messengers you have reproached the Lord , And you have said , “ With my many chariotsI came up to the heights of the mountains , To the remotest parts of Lebanon ; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses . And I entered its farthest lodging place , its thickest forest .
12:19:024:0	I dug wells and drank foreign waters , And with the sole of my feet I dried upAll the rivers of Egypt . ”
12:19:025:0	‘Have you not heard ? Long ago I did it ; From ancient times I planned it . Now I have brought it to pass , That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps .
12:19:026:0	Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength , They were dismayed and put to shame ; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb , As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up .
12:19:027:0	But I know your sitting down , And your going out and your coming in , And your raging against Me .
12:19:028:0	Because of your raging against Me , And because your arrogance has come up to My ears , Therefore I will put My hook in your nose , And My bridle in your lips , And I will turn you back by the way which you came .
12:19:029:0	‘Then this shall be the sign for you : you will eat this year what grows of itself , in the second year what springs from the same , and in the third year sow , reap , plant vineyards , and eat their fruit .
12:19:030:0	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward .
12:19:031:0	For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant , and out of Mount Zion survivors . The zeal of the Lord will perform this .
12:19:032:0	‘Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , “ He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there ; and he will not come before it with a shield or throw up a siege ramp against it .
12:19:033:0	By the way that he came , by the same he will return , and he shall not come to this city , ” ’ declares the Lord .
12:19:034:0	‘For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake . ’ ”
12:19:035:0	Then it happened that night that the angel of the Lord went out and struck 185 , 000 in the camp of the Assyrians ; and when men rose early in the morning , behold , all of them were dead .
12:19:036:0	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home , and lived at Nineveh .
12:19:037:0	It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place .
