12:6:001:1	The Axe Head Recovered
12:6:001:0	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha , “ Behold now , the place before you where we are living is too limited for us .
12:6:002:0	Please let us go to the Jordan and each of us take from there a beam , and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live . ” So he said , “ Go . ”
12:6:003:0	Then one said , “ Please be willing to go with your servants . ” And he answered , “ I shall go . ”
12:6:004:0	So he went with them ; and when they came to the Jordan , they cut down trees .
12:6:005:0	But as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water ; and he cried out and said , “ Alas , my master ! For it was borrowed . ”
12:6:006:0	Then the man of God said , “ Where did it fall ? ” And when he showed him the place , he cut off a stick and threw it in there , and made the iron float .
12:6:002:1	The Arameans Plot to Capture Elisha
12:6:007:0	He said , “ Take it up for yourself . ” So he put out his hand and took it .
12:6:008:0	Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel ; and he counseled with his servants saying , “ In such and such a place shall be my camp . ”
12:6:009:0	The man of God sent word to the king of Israel saying , “ Beware that you do not pass this place , for the Arameans are coming down there . ”
12:6:010:0	The king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had told him ; thus he warned him , so that he guarded himself there , more than once or twice .
12:6:011:0	Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this thing ; and he called his servants and said to them , “ Will you tell me which of us is for the king of Israel ? ”
12:6:012:0	One of his servants said , “ No , my lord , O king ; but Elisha , the prophet who is in Israel , tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom . ”
12:6:013:0	So he said , “ Go and see where he is , that I may send and take him . ” And it was told him , saying , “ Behold , he is in Dothan . ”
12:6:014:0	He sent horses and chariots and a great army there , and they came by night and surrounded the city .
12:6:015:0	Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out , behold , an army with horses and chariots was circling the city . And his servant said to him , “ Alas , my master ! What shall we do ? ”
12:6:016:0	So he answered , “ Do not fear , for those who are with us are more than those who are with them . ”
12:6:017:0	Then Elisha prayed and said , “ O Lord , I pray , open his eyes that he may see . ” And the Lord opened the servant’s eyes and he saw ; and behold , the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha .
12:6:018:0	When they came down to him , Elisha prayed to the Lord and said , “ Strike this people with blindness , I pray . ” So He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
12:6:019:0	Then Elisha said to them , “ This is not the way , nor is this the city ; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek . ” And he brought them to Samaria .
12:6:020:0	When they had come into Samaria , Elisha said , “ O Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . ” So the Lord opened their eyes and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
12:6:021:0	Then the king of Israel when he saw them , said to Elisha , “ My father , shall I kill them ? Shall I kill them ? ”
12:6:022:0	He answered , “ You shall not kill them . Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow ? Set bread and water before them , that they may eat and drink and go to their master . ”
12:6:003:1	The Siege of Samaria—Cannibalism
12:6:023:0	So he prepared a great feast for them ; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away , and they went to their master . And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel .
12:6:024:0	Now it came about after this , that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria .
12:6:025:0	There was a great famine in Samaria ; and behold , they besieged it , until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver , and a fourth of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver .
12:6:026:0	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him , saying , “ Help , my lord , O king ! ”
12:6:027:0	He said , “ If the Lord does not help you , from where shall I help you ? From the threshing floor , or from the wine press ? ”
12:6:028:0	And the king said to her , “ What is the matter with you ? ” And she answered , “ This woman said to me , ‘Give your son that we may eat him today , and we will eat my son tomorrow . ’
12:6:029:0	So we boiled my son and ate him ; and I said to her on the next day , ‘Give your son , that we may eat him’ ; but she has hidden her son . ”
12:6:030:0	When the king heard the words of the woman , he tore his clothes—now he was passing by on the wall—and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth beneath on his body .
12:6:031:0	Then he said , “ May God do so to me and more also , if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today . ”
12:6:032:0	Now Elisha was sitting in his house , and the elders were sitting with him . And the king sent a man from his presence ; but before the messenger came to him , he said to the elders , “ Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head ? Look , when the messenger comes , shut the door and hold the door shut against him . Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him ? ”
12:6:033:0	While he was still talking with them , behold , the messenger came down to him and he said , “ Behold , this evil is from the Lord ; why should I wait for the Lord any longer ? ”
