12:2:001:1	Elijah Taken to Heaven
12:2:001:0	And it came about when the Lord was about to take up Elijah by a whirlwind to heaven , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
12:2:002:0	Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here please , for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel . ” But Elisha said , “ As the Lord lives and as you yourself live , I will not leave you . ” So they went down to Bethel .
12:2:003:0	Then the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today ? ” And he said , “ Yes , I know ; be still . ”
12:2:004:0	Elijah said to him , “ Elisha , please stay here , for the Lord has sent me to Jericho . ” But he said , “ As the Lord lives , and as you yourself live , I will not leave you . ” So they came to Jericho .
12:2:005:0	The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today ? ” And he answered , “ Yes , I know ; be still . ”
12:2:006:0	Then Elijah said to him , “ Please stay here , for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan . ” And he said , “ As the Lord lives , and as you yourself live , I will not leave you . ” So the two of them went on .
12:2:007:0	Now fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance , while the two of them stood by the Jordan .
12:2:008:0	Elijah took his mantle and folded it together and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground .
12:2:009:0	When they had crossed over , Elijah said to Elisha , “ Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you . ” And Elisha said , “ Please , let a double portion of your spirit be upon me . ”
12:2:010:0	He said , “ You have asked a hard thing . Nevertheless , if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so . ”
12:2:011:0	As they were going along and talking , behold , there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them . And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven .
12:2:012:0	Elisha saw it and cried out , “ My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! ” And he saw Elijah no more . Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces .
12:2:013:0	He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
12:2:002:1	Elisha Succeeds Elijah
12:2:014:0	He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said , “ Where is the Lord , the God of Elijah ? ” And when he also had struck the waters , they were divided here and there ; and Elisha crossed over .
12:2:015:0	Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him , they said , “ The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . ” And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
12:2:016:0	They said to him , “ Behold now , there are with your servants fifty strong men , please let them go and search for your master ; perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley . ” And he said , “ You shall not send . ”
12:2:017:0	But when they urged him until he was ashamed , he said , “ Send . ” They sent therefore fifty men ; and they searched three days but did not find him .
12:2:018:0	They returned to him while he was staying at Jericho ; and he said to them , “ Did I not say to you , ‘Do not go’ ? ”
12:2:019:0	Then the men of the city said to Elisha , “ Behold now , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad and the land is unfruitful . ”
12:2:020:0	He said , “ Bring me a new jar , and put salt in it . ” So they brought it to him .
12:2:021:0	He went out to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘I have purified these waters ; there shall not be from there death or unfruitfulness any longer . ’ ”
12:2:022:0	So the waters have been purified to this day , according to the word of Elisha which he spoke .
12:2:023:0	Then he went up from there to Bethel ; and as he was going up by the way , young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him , “ Go up , you baldhead ; go up , you baldhead ! ”
12:2:024:0	When he looked behind him and saw them , he cursed them in the name of the Lord . Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of their number .
12:2:025:0	He went from there to Mount Carmel , and from there he returned to Samaria .
