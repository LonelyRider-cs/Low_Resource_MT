12:13:001:1	Kings of Israel : Jehoahaz and Jehoash
12:13:001:0	In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah , king of Judah , Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel at Samaria , and he reigned seventeen years .
12:13:002:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel sin ; he did not turn from them .
12:13:003:0	So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and He gave them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Aram , and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael .
12:13:004:0	Then Jehoahaz entreated the favor of the Lord , and the Lord listened to him ; for He saw the oppression of Israel , how the king of Aram oppressed them .
12:13:005:0	The Lord gave Israel a deliverer , so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans ; and the sons of Israel lived in their tents as formerly .
12:13:006:0	Nevertheless they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , with which he made Israel sin , but walked in them ; and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria .
12:13:007:0	For he left to Jehoahaz of the army not more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and 10 , 000 footmen , for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing .
12:13:008:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did and his might , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
12:13:009:0	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria ; and Joash his son became king in his place .
12:13:010:0	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah , Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria , and reigned sixteen years .
12:13:011:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord ; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel sin , but he walked in them .
12:13:012:0	Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
12:13:002:1	Death of Elisha
12:13:013:0	So Joash slept with his fathers , and Jeroboam sat on his throne ; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
12:13:014:0	When Elisha became sick with the illness of which he was to die , Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said , “ My father , my father , the chariots of Israel and its horsemen ! ”
12:13:015:0	Elisha said to him , “ Take a bow and arrows . ” So he took a bow and arrows .
12:13:016:0	Then he said to the king of Israel , “ Put your hand on the bow . ” And he put his hand on it , then Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands .
12:13:017:0	He said , “ Open the window toward the east , ” and he opened it . Then Elisha said , “ Shoot ! ” And he shot . And he said , “ The Lord’s arrow of victory , even the arrow of victory over Aram ; for you will defeat the Arameans at Aphek until you have destroyed them . ”
12:13:018:0	Then he said , “ Take the arrows , ” and he took them . And he said to the king of Israel , “ Strike the ground , ” and he struck it three times and stopped .
12:13:019:0	So the man of God was angry with him and said , “ You should have struck five or six times , then you would have struck Aram until you would have destroyed it . But now you shall strike Aram only three times . ”
12:13:020:0	Elisha died , and they buried him . Now the bands of the Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year .
12:13:021:0	As they were burying a man , behold , they saw a marauding band ; and they cast the man into the grave of Elisha . And when the man touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet .
12:13:022:0	Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
12:13:023:0	But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned to them because of His covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence until now .
12:13:024:0	When Hazael king of Aram died , Ben-hadad his son became king in his place .
12:13:025:0	Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of Jehoahaz his father . Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel .
