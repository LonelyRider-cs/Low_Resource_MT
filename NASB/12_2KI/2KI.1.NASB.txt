12:1:001:1	Ahaziah’s Messengers Meet Elijah
12:1:001:0	Now Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab .
12:1:002:0	And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria , and became ill . So he sent messengers and said to them , “ Go , inquire of Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron , whether I will recover from this sickness . ”
12:1:003:0	But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , “ Arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them , ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron ? ’
12:1:004:0	Now therefore thus says the Lord , ‘You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but you shall surely die . ’ ” Then Elijah departed .
12:1:005:0	When the messengers returned to him he said to them , “ Why have you returned ? ”
12:1:006:0	They said to him , “ A man came up to meet us and said to us , ‘Go , return to the king who sent you and say to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron ? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but shall surely die . ’ ” ’ ”
12:1:007:0	He said to them , “ What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you ? ”
12:1:008:0	They answered him , “ He was a hairy man with a leather girdle bound about his loins . ” And he said , “ It is Elijah the Tishbite . ”
12:1:009:0	Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty . And he went up to him , and behold , he was sitting on the top of the hill . And he said to him , “ O man of God , the king says , ‘Come down . ’ ”
12:1:010:0	Elijah replied to the captain of fifty , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty . ” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
12:1:011:0	So he again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty . And he said to him , “ O man of God , thus says the king , ‘Come down quickly . ’ ”
12:1:012:0	Elijah replied to them , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty . ” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty .
12:1:013:0	So he again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty . When the third captain of fifty went up , he came and bowed down on his knees before Elijah , and begged him and said to him , “ O man of God , please let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight .
12:1:014:0	Behold fire came down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties ; but now let my life be precious in your sight . ”
12:1:015:0	The angel of the Lord said to Elijah , “ Go down with him ; do not be afraid of him . ” So he arose and went down with him to the king .
12:1:002:1	Jehoram Reigns over Israel
12:1:016:0	Then he said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub , the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word ? —therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but shall surely die . ’ ”
12:1:017:0	So Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken . And because he had no son , Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat , king of Judah .
12:1:018:0	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
