12:20:001:1	Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery
12:20:001:0	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill . And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘Set your house in order , for you shall die and not live . ’ ”
12:20:002:0	Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord , saying ,
12:20:003:0	“ Remember now , O Lord , I beseech You , how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight . ” And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
12:20:004:0	Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court , the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
12:20:005:0	“ Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people , ‘Thus says the Lord , the God of your father David , “ I have heard your prayer , I have seen your tears ; behold , I will heal you . On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord .
12:20:006:0	I will add fifteen years to your life , and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake . ” ’ ”
12:20:007:0	Then Isaiah said , “ Take a cake of figs . ” And they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
12:20:008:0	Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of the Lord the third day ? ”
12:20:009:0	Isaiah said , “ This shall be the sign to you from the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing that He has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps ? ”
12:20:010:0	So Hezekiah answered , “ It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps ; no , but let the shadow turn backward ten steps . ”
12:20:002:1	Hezekiah Shows Babylon His Treasures
12:20:011:0	Isaiah the prophet cried to the Lord , and He brought the shadow on the stairway back ten steps by which it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz .
12:20:012:0	At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah , for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
12:20:013:0	Hezekiah listened to them , and showed them all his treasure house , the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasuries . There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them .
12:20:014:0	Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him , “ What did these men say , and from where have they come to you ? ” And Hezekiah said , “ They have come from a far country , from Babylon . ”
12:20:015:0	He said , “ What have they seen in your house ? ” So Hezekiah answered , “ They have seen all that is in my house ; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them . ”
12:20:016:0	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Hear the word of the Lord .
12:20:017:0	‘Behold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon ; nothing shall be left , ’ says the Lord .
12:20:018:0	‘Some of your sons who shall issue from you , whom you will beget , will be taken away ; and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon . ’ ”
12:20:019:0	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good . ” For he thought , “ Is it not so , if there will be peace and truth in my days ? ”
12:20:020:0	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might , and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
12:20:021:0	So Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and Manasseh his son became king in his place .
