12:14:001:1	Amaziah Reigns over Judah
12:14:001:0	In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel , Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah became king .
12:14:002:0	He was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem . And his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem .
12:14:003:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like David his father ; he did according to all that Joash his father had done .
12:14:004:0	Only the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
12:14:005:0	Now it came about , as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father .
12:14:006:0	But the sons of the slayers he did not put to death , according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses , as the Lord commanded , saying , “ The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons , nor the sons be put to death for the fathers ; but each shall be put to death for his own sin . ”
12:14:007:0	He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt 10 , 000 and took Sela by war , and named it Joktheel to this day .
12:14:008:0	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , “ Come , let us face each other . ”
12:14:009:0	Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , “ The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon , saying , ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage . ’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon , and trampled the thorn bush .
12:14:010:0	You have indeed defeated Edom , and your heart has become proud . Enjoy your glory and stay at home ; for why should you provoke trouble so that you , even you , would fall , and Judah with you ? ”
12:14:011:0	But Amaziah would not listen . So Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh , which belongs to Judah .
12:14:012:0	Judah was defeated by Israel , and they fled each to his tent .
12:14:013:0	Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth-shemesh , and came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate , 400 cubits .
12:14:002:1	Jeroboam II Succeeds Jehoash in Israel
12:14:014:0	He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasuries of the king’s house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
12:14:015:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
12:14:003:1	Azariah ( Uzziah ) Succeeds Amaziah in Judah
12:14:016:0	So Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place .
12:14:017:0	Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel .
12:14:018:0	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
12:14:019:0	They conspired against him in Jerusalem , and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there .
12:14:020:0	Then they brought him on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David .
12:14:021:0	All the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
12:14:022:0	He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers .
12:14:023:0	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah , Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria , and reigned forty-one years .
12:14:024:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord ; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which he made Israel sin .
12:14:025:0	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah , according to the word of the Lord , the God of Israel , which He spoke through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai , the prophet , who was of Gath-hepher .
12:14:026:0	For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel , which was very bitter ; for there was neither bond nor free , nor was there any helper for Israel .
12:14:004:1	Zechariah Reigns over Israel
12:14:027:0	The Lord did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven , but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
12:14:028:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might , how he fought and how he recovered for Israel , Damascus and Hamath , which had belonged to Judah , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel ?
12:14:029:0	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel , and Zechariah his son became king in his place .
