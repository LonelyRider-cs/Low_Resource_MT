12:18:001:1	Hezekiah Reigns over Judah
12:18:001:0	Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea , the son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king .
12:18:002:0	He was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem ; and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah .
12:18:003:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father David had done .
12:18:004:0	He removed the high places and broke down the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah . He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made , for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it ; and it was called Nehushtan .
12:18:005:0	He trusted in the Lord , the God of Israel ; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor among those who were before him .
12:18:002:1	Hezekiah Victorious
12:18:006:0	For he clung to the Lord ; he did not depart from following Him , but kept His commandments , which the Lord had commanded Moses .
12:18:007:0	And the Lord was with him ; wherever he went he prospered . And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him .
12:18:008:0	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory , from watchtower to fortified city .
12:18:009:0	Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it .
12:18:010:0	At the end of three years they captured it ; in the sixth year of Hezekiah , which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was captured .
12:18:011:0	Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away into exile to Assyria , and put them in Halah and on the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ,
12:18:003:1	Invasion of Judah
12:18:012:0	because they did not obey the voice of the Lord their God , but transgressed His covenant , even all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded ; they would neither listen nor do it .
12:18:013:0	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them .
12:18:014:0	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish , saying , “ I have done wrong . Withdraw from me ; whatever you impose on me I will bear . ” So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold .
12:18:015:0	Hezekiah gave him all the silver which was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasuries of the king’s house .
12:18:016:0	At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
12:18:017:0	Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army to Jerusalem . So they went up and came to Jerusalem . And when they went up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is on the highway of the fuller’s field .
12:18:018:0	When they called to the king , Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , came out to them .
12:18:019:0	Then Rabshakeh said to them , “ Say now to Hezekiah , ‘Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria , “ What is this confidence that you have ?
12:18:020:0	You say ( but they are only empty words ) , ‘I have counsel and strength for the war . ’ Now on whom do you rely , that you have rebelled against me ?
12:18:021:0	Now behold , you rely on the staff of this crushed reed , even on Egypt ; on which if a man leans , it will go into his hand and pierce it . So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him .
12:18:022:0	But if you say to me , ‘We trust in the Lord our God , ’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away , and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem , ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem’ ?
12:18:023:0	Now therefore , come , make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
12:18:024:0	How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master’s servants , and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
12:18:025:0	Have I now come up without the Lord’s approval against this place to destroy it ? The Lord said to me , ‘Go up against this land and destroy it . ’ ” ’ ”
12:18:026:0	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebnah and Joah , said to Rabshakeh , “ Speak now to your servants in Aramaic , for we understand it ; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . ”
12:18:027:0	But Rabshakeh said to them , “ Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words , and not to the men who sit on the wall , doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you ? ”
12:18:028:0	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean , saying , “ Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria .
12:18:029:0	Thus says the king , ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you , for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand ;
12:18:030:0	nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , “ The Lord will surely deliver us , and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria . ”
12:18:031:0	Do not listen to Hezekiah , for thus says the king of Assyria , “ Make your peace with me and come out to me , and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern ,
12:18:032:0	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of olive trees and honey , that you may live and not die . ” But do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you , saying , “ The Lord will deliver us . ”
12:18:033:0	Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
12:18:034:0	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena and Ivvah ? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand ?
12:18:035:0	Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land from my hand , that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand ? ’ ”
12:18:036:0	But the people were silent and answered him not a word , for the king’s commandment was , “ Do not answer him . ”
12:18:037:0	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph , the recorder , came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
