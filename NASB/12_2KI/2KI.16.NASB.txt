12:16:001:1	Ahaz Reigns over Judah
12:16:001:0	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah , Ahaz the son of Jotham , king of Judah , became king .
12:16:002:0	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem ; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God , as his father David had done .
12:16:003:0	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and even made his son pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had driven out from before the sons of Israel .
12:16:004:0	He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree .
12:16:005:0	Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah , king of Israel , came up to Jerusalem to wage war ; and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
12:16:002:1	Ahaz Seeks Help of Aram
12:16:006:0	At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram , and cleared the Judeans out of Elath entirely ; and the Arameans came to Elath and have lived there to this day .
12:16:007:0	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria , saying , “ I am your servant and your son ; come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel , who are rising up against me . ”
12:16:008:0	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king’s house , and sent a present to the king of Assyria .
12:16:003:1	Damascus Falls
12:16:009:0	So the king of Assyria listened to him ; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it , and carried the people of it away into exile to Kir , and put Rezin to death .
12:16:010:0	Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria , and saw the altar which was at Damascus ; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the pattern of the altar and its model , according to all its workmanship .
12:16:011:0	So Urijah the priest built an altar ; according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus , thus Urijah the priest made it , before the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus .
12:16:012:0	When the king came from Damascus , the king saw the altar ; then the king approached the altar and went up to it ,
12:16:013:0	and burned his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar .
12:16:014:0	The bronze altar , which was before the Lord , he brought from the front of the house , from between his altar and the house of the Lord , and he put it on the north side of his altar .
12:16:015:0	Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest , saying , “ Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering and the king’s burnt offering and his meal offering , with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their drink offerings ; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice . But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by . ”
12:16:016:0	So Urijah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded .
12:16:017:0	Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands , and removed the laver from them ; he also took down the sea from the bronze oxen which were under it and put it on a pavement of stone .
12:16:004:1	Hezekiah Reigns over Judah
12:16:018:0	The covered way for the sabbath which they had built in the house , and the outer entry of the king , he removed from the house of the Lord because of the king of Assyria .
12:16:019:0	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
12:16:020:0	So Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place .
