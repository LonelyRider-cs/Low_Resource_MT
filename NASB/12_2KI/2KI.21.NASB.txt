12:21:001:1	Manasseh Succeeds Hezekiah
12:21:001:0	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king , and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem ; and his mother’s name was Hephzibah .
12:21:002:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord dispossessed before the sons of Israel .
12:21:003:0	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah , as Ahab king of Israel had done , and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
12:21:004:0	He built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , “ In Jerusalem I will put My name . ”
12:21:005:0	For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
12:21:006:0	He made his son pass through the fire , practiced witchcraft and used divination , and dealt with mediums and spiritists . He did much evil in the sight of the Lord provoking Him to anger .
12:21:007:0	Then he set the carved image of Asherah that he had made , in the house of which the Lord said to David and to his son Solomon , “ In this house and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel , I will put My name forever .
12:21:008:0	And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers , if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them , and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them . ”
12:21:002:1	The King’s Idolatries Rebuked
12:21:009:0	But they did not listen , and Manasseh seduced them to do evil more than the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the sons of Israel .
12:21:010:0	Now the Lord spoke through His servants the prophets , saying ,
12:21:011:0	“ Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations , having done wickedly more than all the Amorites did who were before him , and has also made Judah sin with his idols ;
12:21:012:0	therefore thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘Behold , I am bringing such calamity on Jerusalem and Judah , that whoever hears of it , both his ears will tingle .
12:21:013:0	I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab , and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish , wiping it and turning it upside down .
12:21:014:0	I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies , and they will become as plunder and spoil to all their enemies ;
12:21:015:0	because they have done evil in My sight , and have been provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came from Egypt , even to this day . ’ ”
12:21:016:0	Moreover , Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin , in doing evil in the sight of the Lord .
12:21:017:0	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin which he committed , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
12:21:003:1	Amon Succeeds Manasseh
12:21:018:0	And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza , and Amon his son became king in his place .
12:21:019:0	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem ; and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
12:21:020:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , as Manasseh his father had done .
12:21:021:0	For he walked in all the way that his father had walked , and served the idols that his father had served and worshiped them .
12:21:022:0	So he forsook the Lord , the God of his fathers , and did not walk in the way of the Lord .
12:21:023:0	The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house .
12:21:024:0	Then the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon , and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
12:21:025:0	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
12:21:026:0	He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza , and Josiah his son became king in his place .
