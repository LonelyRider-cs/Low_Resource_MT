12:9:001:1	Jehu Reigns over Israel
12:9:001:0	Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him , “ Gird up your loins , and take this flask of oil in your hand and go to Ramoth-gilead .
12:9:002:0	When you arrive there , search out Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in and bid him arise from among his brothers , and bring him to an inner room .
12:9:003:0	Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ I have anointed you king over Israel . ” ’ Then open the door and flee and do not wait . ”
12:9:004:0	So the young man , the servant of the prophet , went to Ramoth-gilead .
12:9:005:0	When he came , behold , the captains of the army were sitting , and he said , “ I have a word for you , O captain . ” And Jehu said , “ For which one of us ? ” And he said , “ For you , O captain . ”
12:9:006:0	He arose and went into the house , and he poured the oil on his head and said to him , “ Thus says the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel .
12:9:007:0	You shall strike the house of Ahab your master , that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel .
12:9:008:0	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish , and I will cut off from Ahab every male person both bond and free in Israel .
12:9:009:0	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
12:9:010:0	The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel , and none shall bury her . ’ ” Then he opened the door and fled .
12:9:011:0	Now Jehu came out to the servants of his master , and one said to him , “ Is all well ? Why did this mad fellow come to you ? ” And he said to them , “ You know very well the man and his talk . ”
12:9:012:0	They said , “ It is a lie , tell us now . ” And he said , “ Thus and thus he said to me , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ I have anointed you king over Israel . ” ’ ”
12:9:002:1	Jehoram ( Joram ) Is Assassinated
12:9:013:0	Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him on the bare steps , and blew the trumpet , saying , “ Jehu is king ! ”
12:9:014:0	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram . Now Joram with all Israel was defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram ,
12:9:015:0	but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram . So Jehu said , “ If this is your mind , then let no one escape or leave the city to go tell it in Jezreel . ”
12:9:016:0	Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel , for Joram was lying there . Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram .
12:9:017:0	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came , and said , “ I see a company . ” And Joram said , “ Take a horseman and send him to meet them and let him say , ‘Is it peace ? ’ ”
12:9:018:0	So a horseman went to meet him and said , “ Thus says the king , ‘Is it peace ? ’ ” And Jehu said , “ What have you to do with peace ? Turn behind me . ” And the watchman reported , “ The messenger came to them , but he did not return . ”
12:9:019:0	Then he sent out a second horseman , who came to them and said , “ Thus says the king , ‘Is it peace ? ’ ” And Jehu answered , “ What have you to do with peace ? Turn behind me . ”
12:9:020:0	The watchman reported , “ He came even to them , and he did not return ; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi , for he drives furiously . ”
12:9:021:0	Then Joram said , “ Get ready . ” And they made his chariot ready . Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out , each in his chariot , and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite .
12:9:022:0	When Joram saw Jehu , he said , “ Is it peace , Jehu ? ” And he answered , “ What peace , so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many ? ”
12:9:023:0	So Joram reined about and fled and said to Ahaziah , “ There is treachery , O Ahaziah ! ”
12:9:024:0	And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms ; and the arrow went through his heart and he sank in his chariot .
12:9:025:0	Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer , “ Take him up and cast him into the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite , for I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab his father , that the Lord laid this oracle against him :
12:9:003:1	Jehu Assassinates Ahaziah
12:9:026:0	‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons , ’ says the Lord , ‘and I will repay you in this property , ’ says the Lord . Now then , take and cast him into the property , according to the word of the Lord . ”
12:9:027:0	When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this , he fled by the way of the garden house . And Jehu pursued him and said , “ Shoot him too , in the chariot . ” So they shot him at the ascent of Gur , which is at Ibleam . But he fled to Megiddo and died there .
12:9:028:0	Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David .
12:9:029:0	Now in the eleventh year of Joram , the son of Ahab , Ahaziah became king over Judah .
12:9:030:0	When Jehu came to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it , and she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out the window .
12:9:031:0	As Jehu entered the gate , she said , “ Is it well , Zimri , your master’s murderer ? ”
12:9:004:1	Jezebel Is Slain
12:9:032:0	Then he lifted up his face to the window and said , “ Who is on my side ? Who ? ” And two or three officials looked down at him .
12:9:033:0	He said , “ Throw her down . ” So they threw her down , and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses , and he trampled her under foot .
12:9:034:0	When he came in , he ate and drank ; and he said , “ See now to this cursed woman and bury her , for she is a king’s daughter . ”
12:9:035:0	They went to bury her , but they found nothing more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands .
12:9:036:0	Therefore they returned and told him . And he said , “ This is the word of the Lord , which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , ‘In the property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel ;
12:9:037:0	and the corpse of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel , so they cannot say , “ This is Jezebel . ” ’ ”
