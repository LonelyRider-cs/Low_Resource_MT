12:17:001:1	Hoshea Reigns over Israel
12:17:001:0	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah , Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria , and reigned nine years .
12:17:002:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , only not as the kings of Israel who were before him .
12:17:003:0	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him , and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute .
12:17:004:0	But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea , who had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year ; so the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison .
12:17:002:1	Israel Captive
12:17:005:0	Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years .
12:17:003:1	Why Israel Fell
12:17:006:0	In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria , and settled them in Halah and Habor , on the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
12:17:007:0	Now this came about because the sons of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God , who had brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and they had feared other gods
12:17:008:0	and walked in the customs of the nations whom the Lord had driven out before the sons of Israel , and in the customs of the kings of Israel which they had introduced .
12:17:009:0	The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not right against the Lord their God . Moreover , they built for themselves high places in all their towns , from watchtower to fortified city .
12:17:010:0	They set for themselves sacred pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree ,
12:17:011:0	and there they burned incense on all the high places as the nations did which the Lord had carried away to exile before them ; and they did evil things provoking the Lord .
12:17:012:0	They served idols , concerning which the Lord had said to them , “ You shall not do this thing . ”
12:17:013:0	Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and every seer , saying , “ Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments , My statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers , and which I sent to you through My servants the prophets . ”
12:17:014:0	However , they did not listen , but stiffened their neck like their fathers , who did not believe in the Lord their God .
12:17:015:0	They rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers and His warnings with which He warned them . And they followed vanity and became vain , and went after the nations which surrounded them , concerning which the Lord had commanded them not to do like them .
12:17:016:0	They forsook all the commandments of the Lord their God and made for themselves molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal .
12:17:017:0	Then they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire , and practiced divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking Him .
12:17:018:0	So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight ; none was left except the tribe of Judah .
12:17:019:0	Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God , but walked in the customs which Israel had introduced .
12:17:020:0	The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers , until He had cast them out of His sight .
12:17:021:0	When He had torn Israel from the house of David , they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king . Then Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the Lord and made them commit a great sin .
12:17:022:0	The sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they did not depart from them
12:17:004:1	Cities of Israel Filled with Strangers
12:17:023:0	until the Lord removed Israel from His sight , as He spoke through all His servants the prophets . So Israel was carried away into exile from their own land to Assyria until this day .
12:17:024:0	The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Avva and from Hamath and Sepharvaim , and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the sons of Israel . So they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities .
12:17:025:0	At the beginning of their living there , they did not fear the Lord ; therefore the Lord sent lions among them which killed some of them .
12:17:026:0	So they spoke to the king of Assyria , saying , “ The nations whom you have carried away into exile in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the god of the land ; so he has sent lions among them , and behold , they kill them because they do not know the custom of the god of the land . ”
12:17:027:0	Then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , “ Take there one of the priests whom you carried away into exile and let him go and live there ; and let him teach them the custom of the god of the land . ”
12:17:028:0	So one of the priests whom they had carried away into exile from Samaria came and lived at Bethel , and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
12:17:029:0	But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the houses of the high places which the people of Samaria had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
12:17:030:0	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth , the men of Cuth made Nergal , the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
12:17:031:0	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim .
12:17:032:0	They also feared the Lord and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places , who acted for them in the houses of the high places .
12:17:033:0	They feared the Lord and served their own gods according to the custom of the nations from among whom they had been carried away into exile .
12:17:034:0	To this day they do according to the earlier customs : they do not fear the Lord , nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances or the law , or the commandments which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob , whom He named Israel ;
12:17:035:0	with whom the Lord made a covenant and commanded them , saying , “ You shall not fear other gods , nor bow down yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them .
12:17:036:0	But the Lord , who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm , Him you shall fear , and to Him you shall bow yourselves down , and to Him you shall sacrifice .
12:17:037:0	The statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which He wrote for you , you shall observe to do forever ; and you shall not fear other gods .
12:17:038:0	The covenant that I have made with you , you shall not forget , nor shall you fear other gods .
12:17:039:0	But the Lord your God you shall fear ; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies . ”
12:17:040:0	However , they did not listen , but they did according to their earlier custom .
12:17:041:0	So while these nations feared the Lord , they also served their idols ; their children likewise and their grandchildren , as their fathers did , so they do to this day .
