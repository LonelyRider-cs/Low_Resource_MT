12:22:001:1	Josiah Succeeds Amon
12:22:001:0	Josiah was eight years old when he became king , and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem ; and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
12:22:002:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord and walked in all the way of his father David , nor did he turn aside to the right or to the left .
12:22:003:0	Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah , the king sent Shaphan , the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe , to the house of the Lord saying ,
12:22:004:0	“ Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought in to the house of the Lord which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people .
12:22:005:0	Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord , and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the Lord to repair the damages of the house ,
12:22:006:0	to the carpenters and the builders and the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
12:22:002:1	The Lost Book
12:22:007:0	Only no accounting shall be made with them for the money delivered into their hands , for they deal faithfully . ”
12:22:008:0	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , “ I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . ” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan who read it .
12:22:009:0	Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said , “ Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord . ”
12:22:010:0	Moreover , Shaphan the scribe told the king saying , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book . ” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king .
12:22:011:0	When the king heard the words of the book of the law , he tore his clothes .
12:22:012:0	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam the son of Shaphan , Achbor the son of Micaiah , Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah the king’s servant saying ,
12:22:003:1	Huldah Predicts
12:22:013:0	“ Go , inquire of the Lord for me and the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found , for great is the wrath of the Lord that burns against us , because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book , to do according to all that is written concerning us . ”
12:22:014:0	So Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam , Achbor , Shaphan , and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter ) ; and they spoke to her .
12:22:015:0	She said to them , “ Thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘Tell the man who sent you to me ,
12:22:016:0	thus says the Lord , “ Behold , I bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read .
12:22:017:0	Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands , therefore My wrath burns against this place , and it shall not be quenched . ” ’
12:22:018:0	But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord thus shall you say to him , ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel , “ Regarding the words which you have heard ,
12:22:019:0	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants that they should become a desolation and a curse , and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me , I truly have heard you , ” declares the Lord .
12:22:020:0	“ Therefore , behold , I will gather you to your fathers , and you will be gathered to your grave in peace , and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place . ” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king .
