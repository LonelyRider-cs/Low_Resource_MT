12:3:001:1	Jehoram Meets Moab Rebellion
12:3:001:0	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned twelve years .
12:3:002:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord , though not like his father and his mother ; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal which his father had made .
12:3:003:0	Nevertheless , he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which he made Israel sin ; he did not depart from them .
12:3:004:0	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder , and used to pay the king of Israel 100 , 000 lambs and the wool of 100 , 000 rams .
12:3:005:0	But when Ahab died , the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
12:3:006:0	And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel .
12:3:007:0	Then he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , saying , “ The king of Moab has rebelled against me . Will you go with me to fight against Moab ? ” And he said , “ I will go up ; I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses . ”
12:3:008:0	He said , “ Which way shall we go up ? ” And he answered , “ The way of the wilderness of Edom . ”
12:3:009:0	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom ; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey , and there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them .
12:3:010:0	Then the king of Israel said , “ Alas ! For the Lord has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab . ”
12:3:011:0	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not a prophet of the Lord here , that we may inquire of the Lord by him ? ” And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said , “ Elisha the son of Shaphat is here , who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah . ”
12:3:012:0	Jehoshaphat said , “ The word of the Lord is with him . ” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
12:3:013:0	Now Elisha said to the king of Israel , “ What do I have to do with you ? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother . ” And the king of Israel said to him , “ No , for the Lord has called these three kings together to give them into the hand of Moab . ”
12:3:014:0	Elisha said , “ As the Lord of hosts lives , before whom I stand , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look at you nor see you .
12:3:015:0	But now bring me a minstrel . ” And it came about , when the minstrel played , that the hand of the Lord came upon him .
12:3:016:0	He said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘Make this valley full of trenches . ’
12:3:017:0	For thus says the Lord , ‘You shall not see wind nor shall you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , so that you shall drink , both you and your cattle and your beasts .
12:3:018:0	This is but a slight thing in the sight of the Lord ; He will also give the Moabites into your hand .
12:3:019:0	Then you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city , and fell every good tree and stop all springs of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ’ ”
12:3:020:0	It happened in the morning about the time of offering the sacrifice , that behold , water came by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
12:3:021:0	Now all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them . And all who were able to put on armor and older were summoned and stood on the border .
12:3:022:0	They rose early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood .
12:3:023:0	Then they said , “ This is blood ; the kings have surely fought together , and they have slain one another . Now therefore , Moab , to the spoil ! ”
12:3:024:0	But when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites arose and struck the Moabites , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land , slaughtering the Moabites .
12:3:025:0	Thus they destroyed the cities ; and each one threw a stone on every piece of good land and filled it . So they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees , until in Kir-hareseth only they left its stones ; however , the slingers went about it and struck it .
12:3:026:0	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him , he took with him 700 men who drew swords , to break through to the king of Edom ; but they could not .
12:3:027:0	Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place , and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall . And there came great wrath against Israel , and they departed from him and returned to their own land .
