12:8:001:1	Jehoram Restores the Shunammite’s Land
12:8:001:0	Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life , saying , “ Arise and go with your household , and sojourn wherever you can sojourn ; for the Lord has called for a famine , and it will even come on the land for seven years . ”
12:8:002:0	So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God , and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
12:8:003:0	At the end of seven years , the woman returned from the land of the Philistines ; and she went out to appeal to the king for her house and for her field .
12:8:004:0	Now the king was talking with Gehazi , the servant of the man of God , saying , “ Please relate to me all the great things that Elisha has done . ”
12:8:005:0	As he was relating to the king how he had restored to life the one who was dead , behold , the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and for her field . And Gehazi said , “ My lord , O king , this is the woman and this is her son , whom Elisha restored to life . ”
12:8:002:1	Elisha Predicts Evil from Hazael
12:8:006:0	When the king asked the woman , she related it to him . So the king appointed for her a certain officer , saying , “ Restore all that was hers and all the produce of the field from the day that she left the land even until now . ”
12:8:007:0	Then Elisha came to Damascus . Now Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick , and it was told him , saying , “ The man of God has come here . ”
12:8:008:0	The king said to Hazael , “ Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God , and inquire of the Lord by him , saying , ‘Will I recover from this sickness ? ’ ”
12:8:009:0	So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand , even every kind of good thing of Damascus , forty camels’ loads ; and he came and stood before him and said , “ Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you , saying , ‘Will I recover from this sickness ? ’ ”
12:8:010:0	Then Elisha said to him , “ Go , say to him , ‘You will surely recover , ’ but the Lord has shown me that he will certainly die . ”
12:8:011:0	He fixed his gaze steadily on him until he was ashamed , and the man of God wept .
12:8:012:0	Hazael said , “ Why does my lord weep ? ” Then he answered , “ Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel : their strongholds you will set on fire , and their young men you will kill with the sword , and their little ones you will dash in pieces , and their women with child you will rip up . ”
12:8:013:0	Then Hazael said , “ But what is your servant , who is but a dog , that he should do this great thing ? ” And Elisha answered , “ The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Aram . ”
12:8:014:0	So he departed from Elisha and returned to his master , who said to him , “ What did Elisha say to you ? ” And he answered , “ He told me that you would surely recover . ”
12:8:003:1	Another Jehoram Reigns in Judah
12:8:015:0	On the following day , he took the cover and dipped it in water and spread it on his face , so that he died . And Hazael became king in his place .
12:8:016:0	Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then the king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king .
12:8:017:0	He was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
12:8:018:0	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel , just as the house of Ahab had done , for the daughter of Ahab became his wife ; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
12:8:019:0	However , the Lord was not willing to destroy Judah , for the sake of David His servant , since He had promised him to give a lamp to him through his sons always .
12:8:020:0	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
12:8:021:0	Then Joram crossed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him . And he arose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots ; but his army fled to their tents .
12:8:022:0	So Edom revolted against Judah to this day . Then Libnah revolted at the same time .
12:8:004:1	Ahaziah Succeeds Jehoram in Judah
12:8:023:0	The rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah ?
12:8:024:0	So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place .
12:8:025:0	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
12:8:026:0	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . And his mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel .
12:8:027:0	He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the Lord , like the house of Ahab had done , because he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab .
12:8:028:0	Then he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead , and the Arameans wounded Joram .
12:8:029:0	So King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram . Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick .
