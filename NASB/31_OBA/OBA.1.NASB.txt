31:1:001:1	Edom Will Be Humbled
31:1:001:0	The vision of Obadiah . Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom—We have heard a report from the Lord , And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying , “ Arise and let us go against her for battle ” —
31:1:002:0	“ Behold , I will make you small among the nations ; You are greatly despised .
31:1:003:0	The arrogance of your heart has deceived you , You who live in the clefts of the rock , In the loftiness of your dwelling place , Who say in your heart , ‘Who will bring me down to earth ? ’
31:1:004:0	Though you build high like the eagle , Though you set your nest among the stars , From there I will bring you down , ” declares the Lord .
31:1:005:0	“ If thieves came to you , If robbers by night—O how you will be ruined ! —Would they not steal only until they had enough ? If grape gatherers came to you , Would they not leave some gleanings ?
31:1:006:0	O how Esau will be ransacked , And his hidden treasures searched out !
31:1:007:0	All the men allied with youWill send you forth to the border , And the men at peace with youWill deceive you and overpower you . They who eat your breadWill set an ambush for you . ( There is no understanding in him . )
31:1:008:0	Will I not on that day , ” declares the Lord , “ Destroy wise men from EdomAnd understanding from the mountain of Esau ?
31:1:009:0	Then your mighty men will be dismayed , O Teman , So that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter .
31:1:010:0	“ Because of violence to your brother Jacob , You will be covered with shame , And you will be cut off forever .
31:1:011:0	On the day that you stood aloof , On the day that strangers carried off his wealth , And foreigners entered his gateAnd cast lots for Jerusalem—You too were as one of them .
31:1:012:0	Do not gloat over your brother’s day , The day of his misfortune . And do not rejoice over the sons of JudahIn the day of their destruction ; Yes , do not boastIn the day of their distress .
31:1:013:0	Do not enter the gate of My peopleIn the day of their disaster . Yes , you , do not gloat over their calamityIn the day of their disaster . And do not loot their wealthIn the day of their disaster .
31:1:002:1	The Day of the L
31:1:003:1	ord
31:1:004:1	and the Future
31:1:014:0	Do not stand at the fork of the roadTo cut down their fugitives ; And do not imprison their survivorsIn the day of their distress .
31:1:015:0	“ For the day of the Lord draws near on all the nations . As you have done , it will be done to you . Your dealings will return on your own head .
31:1:016:0	Because just as you drank on My holy mountain , All the nations will drink continually . They will drink and swallowAnd become as if they had never existed .
31:1:017:0	But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape , And it will be holy . And the house of Jacob will possess their possessions .
31:1:018:0	Then the house of Jacob will be a fireAnd the house of Joseph a flame ; But the house of Esau will be as stubble . And they will set them on fire and consume them , So that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau , ” For the Lord has spoken .
31:1:019:0	Then those of the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau , And those of the Shephelah the Philistine plain ; Also , possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria , And Benjamin will possess Gilead .
31:1:020:0	And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel , Who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath , And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in SepharadWill possess the cities of the Negev .
31:1:021:0	The deliverers will ascend Mount ZionTo judge the mountain of Esau , And the kingdom will be the Lord’s .
