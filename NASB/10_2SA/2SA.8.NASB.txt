10:8:001:1	David’s Triumphs
10:8:001:0	Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them ; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines .
10:8:002:0	He defeated Moab , and measured them with the line , making them lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive . And the Moabites became servants to David , bringing tribute .
10:8:003:0	Then David defeated Hadadezer , the son of Rehob king of Zobah , as he went to restore his rule at the River .
10:8:004:0	David captured from him 1 , 700 horsemen and 20 , 000 foot soldiers ; and David hamstrung the chariot horses , but reserved enough of them for 100 chariots .
10:8:005:0	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer , king of Zobah , David killed 22 , 000 Arameans .
10:8:006:0	Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus , and the Arameans became servants to David , bringing tribute . And the Lord helped David wherever he went .
10:8:007:0	David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem .
10:8:008:0	From Betah and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , King David took a very large amount of bronze .
10:8:009:0	Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer ,
10:8:010:0	Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him , because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him ; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi . And Joram brought with him articles of silver , of gold and of bronze .
10:8:011:0	King David also dedicated these to the Lord , with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued :
10:8:012:0	from Aram and Moab and the sons of Ammon and the Philistines and Amalek , and from the spoil of Hadadezer , son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
10:8:013:0	So David made a name for himself when he returned from killing 18 , 000 Arameans in the Valley of Salt .
10:8:014:0	He put garrisons in Edom . In all Edom he put garrisons , and all the Edomites became servants to David . And the Lord helped David wherever he went .
10:8:015:0	So David reigned over all Israel ; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people .
10:8:016:0	Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army , and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder .
10:8:017:0	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests , and Seraiah was secretary .
10:8:018:0	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and David’s sons were chief ministers .
