10:4:001:1	Ish-bosheth Murdered
10:4:001:0	Now when Ish-bosheth , Saul’s son , heard that Abner had died in Hebron , he lost courage , and all Israel was disturbed .
10:4:002:0	Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of bands : the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab , sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , of the sons of Benjamin ( for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin ,
10:4:003:0	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been aliens there until this day ) .
10:4:004:0	Now Jonathan , Saul’s son , had a son crippled in his feet . He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel , and his nurse took him up and fled . And it happened that in her hurry to flee , he fell and became lame . And his name was Mephibosheth .
10:4:005:0	So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest .
10:4:006:0	They came to the middle of the house as if to get wheat , and they struck him in the belly ; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
10:4:007:0	Now when they came into the house , as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom , they struck him and killed him and beheaded him . And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night .
10:4:008:0	Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king , “ Behold , the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul , your enemy , who sought your life ; thus the Lord has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants . ”
10:4:009:0	David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said to them , “ As the Lord lives , who has redeemed my life from all distress ,
10:4:010:0	when one told me , saying , ‘Behold , Saul is dead , ’ and thought he was bringing good news , I seized him and killed him in Ziklag , which was the reward I gave him for his news .
10:4:011:0	How much more , when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood from your hand and destroy you from the earth ? ”
10:4:012:0	Then David commanded the young men , and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron . But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron .
