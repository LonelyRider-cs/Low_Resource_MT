10:7:001:1	David Plans to Build a Temple
10:7:001:0	Now it came about when the king lived in his house , and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies ,
10:7:002:0	that the king said to Nathan the prophet , “ See now , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains . ”
10:7:003:0	Nathan said to the king , “ Go , do all that is in your mind , for the Lord is with you . ”
10:7:004:0	But in the same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan , saying ,
10:7:005:0	“ Go and say to My servant David , ‘Thus says the Lord , “ Are you the one who should build Me a house to dwell in ?
10:7:006:0	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt , even to this day ; but I have been moving about in a tent , even in a tabernacle .
10:7:002:1	God’s Covenant with David
10:7:007:0	Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel , did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel , which I commanded to shepherd My people Israel , saying , ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar ? ’ ” ’
10:7:008:0	Now therefore , thus you shall say to My servant David , ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts , “ I took you from the pasture , from following the sheep , to be ruler over My people Israel .
10:7:009:0	I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you ; and I will make you a great name , like the names of the great men who are on the earth .
10:7:010:0	I will also appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them , that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again , nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly ,
10:7:011:0	even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel ; and I will give you rest from all your enemies . The Lord also declares to you that the Lord will make a house for you .
10:7:012:0	When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers , I will raise up your descendant after you , who will come forth from you , and I will establish his kingdom .
10:7:013:0	He shall build a house for My name , and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever .
10:7:014:0	I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me ; when he commits iniquity , I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men ,
10:7:015:0	but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him , as I took it away from Saul , whom I removed from before you .
10:7:016:0	Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever ; your throne shall be established forever . ” ’ ”
10:7:003:1	David’s Prayer
10:7:017:0	In accordance with all these words and all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David .
10:7:018:0	Then David the king went in and sat before the Lord , and he said , “ Who am I , O Lord God , and what is my house , that You have brought me this far ?
10:7:019:0	And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes , O Lord God , for You have spoken also of the house of Your servant concerning the distant future . And this is the custom of man , O Lord God .
10:7:020:0	Again what more can David say to You ? For You know Your servant , O Lord God !
10:7:021:0	For the sake of Your word , and according to Your own heart , You have done all this greatness to let Your servant know .
10:7:022:0	For this reason You are great , O Lord God ; for there is none like You , and there is no God besides You , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
10:7:023:0	And what one nation on the earth is like Your people Israel , whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself , and to do a great thing for You and awesome things for Your land , before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt , from nations and their gods ?
10:7:024:0	For You have established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your own people forever , and You , O Lord , have become their God .
10:7:025:0	Now therefore , O Lord God , the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house , confirm it forever , and do as You have spoken ,
10:7:026:0	that Your name may be magnified forever , by saying , ‘The Lord of hosts is God over Israel’ ; and may the house of Your servant David be established before You .
10:7:027:0	For You , O Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , have made a revelation to Your servant , saying , ‘I will build you a house’ ; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You .
10:7:028:0	Now , O Lord God , You are God , and Your words are truth , and You have promised this good thing to Your servant .
10:7:029:0	Now therefore , may it please You to bless the house of Your servant , that it may continue forever before You . For You , O Lord God , have spoken ; and with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever . ”
