10:17:001:1	Hushai’s Counsel
10:17:001:0	Furthermore , Ahithophel said to Absalom , “ Please let me choose 12 , 000 men that I may arise and pursue David tonight .
10:17:002:0	I will come upon him while he is weary and exhausted and terrify him , so that all the people who are with him will flee . Then I will strike down the king alone ,
10:17:003:0	and I will bring back all the people to you . The return of everyone depends on the man you seek ; then all the people will be at peace . ”
10:17:004:0	So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel .
10:17:005:0	Then Absalom said , “ Now call Hushai the Archite also , and let us hear what he has to say . ”
10:17:006:0	When Hushai had come to Absalom , Absalom said to him , “ Ahithophel has spoken thus . Shall we carry out his plan ? If not , you speak . ”
10:17:007:0	So Hushai said to Absalom , “ This time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good . ”
10:17:008:0	Moreover , Hushai said , “ You know your father and his men , that they are mighty men and they are fierce , like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field . And your father is an expert in warfare , and will not spend the night with the people .
10:17:009:0	Behold , he has now hidden himself in one of the caves or in another place ; and it will be when he falls on them at the first attack , that whoever hears it will say , ‘There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom . ’
10:17:010:0	And even the one who is valiant , whose heart is like the heart of a lion , will completely lose heart ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men .
10:17:011:0	But I counsel that all Israel be surely gathered to you , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea in abundance , and that you personally go into battle .
10:17:012:0	So we shall come to him in one of the places where he can be found , and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men who are with him , not even one will be left .
10:17:013:0	If he withdraws into a city , then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city , and we will drag it into the valley until not even a small stone is found there . ”
10:17:002:1	Hushai’s Warning Saves David
10:17:014:0	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said , “ The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . ” For the Lord had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel , so that the Lord might bring calamity on Absalom .
10:17:015:0	Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , “ This is what Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel , and this is what I have counseled .
10:17:016:0	Now therefore , send quickly and tell David , saying , ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness , but by all means cross over , or else the king and all the people who are with him will be destroyed . ’ ”
10:17:017:0	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel , and a maidservant would go and tell them , and they would go and tell King David , for they could not be seen entering the city .
10:17:018:0	But a lad did see them and told Absalom ; so the two of them departed quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim , who had a well in his courtyard , and they went down into it .
10:17:019:0	And the woman took a covering and spread it over the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it , so that nothing was known .
10:17:020:0	Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and said , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” And the woman said to them , “ They have crossed the brook of water . ” And when they searched and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
10:17:021:0	It came about after they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told King David ; and they said to David , “ Arise and cross over the water quickly for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you . ”
10:17:022:0	Then David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed the Jordan ; and by dawn not even one remained who had not crossed the Jordan .
10:17:023:0	Now when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his donkey and arose and went to his home , to his city , and set his house in order , and strangled himself ; thus he died and was buried in the grave of his father .
10:17:024:0	Then David came to Mahanaim . And Absalom crossed the Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
10:17:025:0	Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab . Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite , who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister of Zeruiah , Joab’s mother .
10:17:026:0	And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead .
10:17:027:0	Now when David had come to Mahanaim , Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon , Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar , and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim ,
10:17:028:0	brought beds , basins , pottery , wheat , barley , flour , parched grain , beans , lentils , parched seeds ,
10:17:029:0	honey , curds , sheep , and cheese of the herd , for David and for the people who were with him , to eat ; for they said , “ The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness . ”
