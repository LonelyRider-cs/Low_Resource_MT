10:23:001:1	David’s Last Song
10:23:001:0	Now these are the last words of David . David the son of Jesse declares , The man who was raised on high declares , The anointed of the God of Jacob , And the sweet psalmist of Israel ,
10:23:002:0	“ The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me , And His word was on my tongue .
10:23:003:0	The God of Israel said , The Rock of Israel spoke to me , ‘He who rules over men righteously , Who rules in the fear of God ,
10:23:004:0	Is as the light of the morning when the sun rises , A morning without clouds , When the tender grass springs out of the earth , Through sunshine after rain . ’
10:23:005:0	Truly is not my house so with God ? For He has made an everlasting covenant with me , Ordered in all things , and secured ; For all my salvation and all my desire , Will He not indeed make it grow ?
10:23:006:0	But the worthless , every one of them will be thrust away like thorns , Because they cannot be taken in hand ;
10:23:002:1	His Mighty Men
10:23:007:0	But the man who touches themMust be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear , And they will be completely burned with fire in their place . ”
10:23:008:0	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite , chief of the captains , he was called Adino the Eznite , because of eight hundred slain by him at one time ;
10:23:009:0	and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite , one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle and the men of Israel had withdrawn .
10:23:010:0	He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword , and the Lord brought about a great victory that day ; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain .
10:23:011:0	Now after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite . And the Philistines were gathered into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils , and the people fled from the Philistines .
10:23:012:0	But he took his stand in the midst of the plot , defended it and struck the Philistines ; and the Lord brought about a great victory .
10:23:013:0	Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam , while the troop of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim .
10:23:014:0	David was then in the stronghold , while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem .
10:23:015:0	David had a craving and said , “ Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate ! ”
10:23:016:0	So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines , and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate , and took it and brought it to David . Nevertheless he would not drink it , but poured it out to the Lord ;
10:23:017:0	and he said , “ Be it far from me , O Lord , that I should do this . Shall I drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives ? ” Therefore he would not drink it . These things the three mighty men did .
10:23:018:0	Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief of the thirty . And he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name as well as the three .
10:23:019:0	He was most honored of the thirty , therefore he became their commander ; however , he did not attain to the three .
10:23:020:0	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab . He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day .
10:23:021:0	He killed an Egyptian , an impressive man . Now the Egyptian had a spear in his hand , but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear .
10:23:022:0	These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did , and had a name as well as the three mighty men .
10:23:023:0	He was honored among the thirty , but he did not attain to the three . And David appointed him over his guard .
10:23:024:0	Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty ; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
10:23:025:0	Shammah the Harodite , Elika the Harodite ,
