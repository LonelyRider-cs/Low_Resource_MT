10:24:001:1	The Census Taken
10:24:001:0	Now again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel , and it incited David against them to say , “ Go , number Israel and Judah . ”
10:24:002:0	The king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him , “ Go about now through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan to Beersheba , and register the people , that I may know the number of the people . ”
10:24:003:0	But Joab said to the king , “ Now may the Lord your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are , while the eyes of my lord the king still see ; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing ? ”
10:24:004:0	Nevertheless , the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army . So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to register the people of Israel .
10:24:005:0	They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer , on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer .
10:24:006:0	Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi , and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon ,
10:24:007:0	and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites , and they went out to the south of Judah , to Beersheba .
10:24:008:0	So when they had gone about through the whole land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
10:24:009:0	And Joab gave the number of the registration of the people to the king ; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword , and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
10:24:010:0	Now David’s heart troubled him after he had numbered the people . So David said to the Lord , “ I have sinned greatly in what I have done . But now , O Lord , please take away the iniquity of Your servant , for I have acted very foolishly . ”
10:24:011:0	When David arose in the morning , the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad , David’s seer , saying ,
10:24:012:0	“ Go and speak to David , ‘Thus the Lord says , “ I am offering you three things ; choose for yourself one of them , which I will do to you . ” ’ ”
10:24:013:0	So Gad came to David and told him , and said to him , “ Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land ? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you ? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land ? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me . ”
10:24:002:1	Pestilence Sent
10:24:014:0	Then David said to Gad , “ I am in great distress . Let us now fall into the hand of the Lord for His mercies are great , but do not let me fall into the hand of man . ”
10:24:015:0	So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time , and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died .
10:24:016:0	When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it , the Lord relented from the calamity and said to the angel who destroyed the people , “ It is enough ! Now relax your hand ! ” And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
10:24:003:1	David Builds an Altar
10:24:017:0	Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking down the people , and said , “ Behold , it is I who have sinned , and it is I who have done wrong ; but these sheep , what have they done ? Please let Your hand be against me and against my father’s house . ”
10:24:018:0	So Gad came to David that day and said to him , “ Go up , erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite . ”
10:24:019:0	David went up according to the word of Gad , just as the Lord had commanded .
10:24:020:0	Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him ; and Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king .
10:24:021:0	Then Araunah said , “ Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? ” And David said , “ To buy the threshing floor from you , in order to build an altar to the Lord , that the plague may be held back from the people . ”
10:24:022:0	Araunah said to David , “ Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight . Look , the oxen for the burnt offering , the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood .
10:24:023:0	Everything , O king , Araunah gives to the king . ” And Araunah said to the king , “ May the Lord your God accept you . ”
10:24:024:0	However , the king said to Araunah , “ No , but I will surely buy it from you for a price , for I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God which cost me nothing . ” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver .
10:24:025:0	David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . Thus the Lord was moved by prayer for the land , and the plague was held back from Israel .
