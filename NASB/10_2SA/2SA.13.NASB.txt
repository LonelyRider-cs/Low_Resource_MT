10:13:001:1	Amnon and Tamar
10:13:001:0	Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar , and Amnon the son of David loved her .
10:13:002:0	Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill , for she was a virgin , and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her .
10:13:003:0	But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David’s brother ; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man .
10:13:004:0	He said to him , “ O son of the king , why are you so depressed morning after morning ? Will you not tell me ? ” Then Amnon said to him , “ I am in love with Tamar , the sister of my brother Absalom . ”
10:13:005:0	Jonadab then said to him , “ Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill ; when your father comes to see you , say to him , ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me some food to eat , and let her prepare the food in my sight , that I may see it and eat from her hand . ’ ”
10:13:006:0	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill ; when the king came to see him , Amnon said to the king , “ Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat from her hand . ”
10:13:007:0	Then David sent to the house for Tamar , saying , “ Go now to your brother Amnon’s house , and prepare food for him . ”
10:13:008:0	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house , and he was lying down . And she took dough , kneaded it , made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
10:13:009:0	She took the pan and dished them out before him , but he refused to eat . And Amnon said , “ Have everyone go out from me . ” So everyone went out from him .
10:13:010:0	Then Amnon said to Tamar , “ Bring the food into the bedroom , that I may eat from your hand . ” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon .
10:13:011:0	When she brought them to him to eat , he took hold of her and said to her , “ Come , lie with me , my sister . ”
10:13:012:0	But she answered him , “ No , my brother , do not violate me , for such a thing is not done in Israel ; do not do this disgraceful thing !
10:13:013:0	As for me , where could I get rid of my reproach ? And as for you , you will be like one of the fools in Israel . Now therefore , please speak to the king , for he will not withhold me from you . ”
10:13:014:0	However , he would not listen to her ; since he was stronger than she , he violated her and lay with her .
10:13:015:0	Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . And Amnon said to her , “ Get up , go away ! ”
10:13:016:0	But she said to him , “ No , because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me ! ” Yet he would not listen to her .
10:13:017:0	Then he called his young man who attended him and said , “ Now throw this woman out of my presence , and lock the door behind her . ”
10:13:018:0	Now she had on a long-sleeved garment ; for in this manner the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes . Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her .
10:13:019:0	Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment which was on her ; and she put her hand on her head and went away , crying aloud as she went .
10:13:020:0	Then Absalom her brother said to her , “ Has Amnon your brother been with you ? But now keep silent , my sister , he is your brother ; do not take this matter to heart . ” So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom’s house .
10:13:021:0	Now when King David heard of all these matters , he was very angry .
10:13:022:0	But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad ; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar .
10:13:002:1	Absalom Avenges Tamar
10:13:023:0	Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor , which is near Ephraim , and Absalom invited all the king’s sons .
10:13:024:0	Absalom came to the king and said , “ Behold now , your servant has sheepshearers ; please let the king and his servants go with your servant . ”
10:13:025:0	But the king said to Absalom , “ No , my son , we should not all go , for we will be burdensome to you . ” Although he urged him , he would not go , but blessed him .
10:13:026:0	Then Absalom said , “ If not , please let my brother Amnon go with us . ” And the king said to him , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
10:13:027:0	But when Absalom urged him , he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him .
10:13:028:0	Absalom commanded his servants , saying , “ See now , when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine , and when I say to you , ‘Strike Amnon , ’ then put him to death . Do not fear ; have not I myself commanded you ? Be courageous and be valiant . ”
10:13:029:0	The servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded . Then all the king’s sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled .
10:13:030:0	Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David , saying , “ Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons , and not one of them is left . ”
10:13:031:0	Then the king arose , tore his clothes and lay on the ground ; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn .
10:13:032:0	Jonadab , the son of Shimeah , David’s brother , responded , “ Do not let my lord suppose they have put to death all the young men , the king’s sons , for Amnon alone is dead ; because by the intent of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he violated his sister Tamar .
10:13:033:0	Now therefore , do not let my lord the king take the report to heart , namely , ‘all the king’s sons are dead , ’ for only Amnon is dead . ”
10:13:034:0	Now Absalom had fled . And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked , and behold , many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain .
10:13:035:0	Jonadab said to the king , “ Behold , the king’s sons have come ; according to your servant’s word , so it happened . ”
10:13:036:0	As soon as he had finished speaking , behold , the king’s sons came and lifted their voices and wept ; and also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly .
10:13:037:0	Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud , the king of Geshur . And David mourned for his son every day .
10:13:038:0	So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur , and was there three years .
10:13:039:0	The heart of King David longed to go out to Absalom ; for he was comforted concerning Amnon , since he was dead .
