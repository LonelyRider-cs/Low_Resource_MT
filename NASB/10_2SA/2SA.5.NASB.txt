10:5:001:1	David King over All Israel
10:5:001:0	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said , “ Behold , we are your bone and your flesh .
10:5:002:0	Previously , when Saul was king over us , you were the one who led Israel out and in . And the Lord said to you , ‘You will shepherd My people Israel , and you will be a ruler over Israel . ’ ”
10:5:003:0	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron , and King David made a covenant with them before the Lord at Hebron ; then they anointed David king over Israel .
10:5:004:0	David was thirty years old when he became king , and he reigned forty years .
10:5:005:0	At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months , and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah .
10:5:006:0	Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , and they said to David , “ You shall not come in here , but the blind and lame will turn you away ” ; thinking , “ David cannot enter here . ”
10:5:007:0	Nevertheless , David captured the stronghold of Zion , that is the city of David .
10:5:008:0	David said on that day , “ Whoever would strike the Jebusites , let him reach the lame and the blind , who are hated by David’s soul , through the water tunnel . ” Therefore they say , “ The blind or the lame shall not come into the house . ”
10:5:009:0	So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David . And David built all around from the Millo and inward .
10:5:010:0	David became greater and greater , for the Lord God of hosts was with him .
10:5:011:0	Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons ; and they built a house for David .
10:5:012:0	And David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel , and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel .
10:5:013:0	Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem , after he came from Hebron ; and more sons and daughters were born to David .
10:5:014:0	Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua , Shobab , Nathan , Solomon ,
10:5:015:0	Ibhar , Elishua , Nepheg , Japhia ,
10:5:002:1	War with the Philistines
10:5:016:0	Elishama , Eliada and Eliphelet .
10:5:017:0	When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek out David ; and when David heard of it , he went down to the stronghold .
10:5:018:0	Now the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim .
10:5:019:0	Then David inquired of the Lord , saying , “ Shall I go up against the Philistines ? Will You give them into my hand ? ” And the Lord said to David , “ Go up , for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand . ”
10:5:020:0	So David came to Baal-perazim and defeated them there ; and he said , “ The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters . ” Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim .
10:5:021:0	They abandoned their idols there , so David and his men carried them away .
10:5:022:0	Now the Philistines came up once again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim .
10:5:023:0	When David inquired of the Lord , He said , “ You shall not go directly up ; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees .
10:5:024:0	It shall be , when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees , then you shall act promptly , for then the Lord will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . ”
10:5:025:0	Then David did so , just as the Lord had commanded him , and struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer .
