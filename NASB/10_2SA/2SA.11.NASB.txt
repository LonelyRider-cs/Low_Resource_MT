10:11:001:1	Bathsheba , David’s Great Sin
10:11:001:0	Then it happened in the spring , at the time when kings go out to battle , that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel , and they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah . But David stayed at Jerusalem .
10:11:002:0	Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king’s house , and from the roof he saw a woman bathing ; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance .
10:11:003:0	So David sent and inquired about the woman . And one said , “ Is this not Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ? ”
10:11:004:0	David sent messengers and took her , and when she came to him , he lay with her ; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness , she returned to her house .
10:11:005:0	The woman conceived ; and she sent and told David , and said , “ I am pregnant . ”
10:11:006:0	Then David sent to Joab , saying , “ Send me Uriah the Hittite . ” So Joab sent Uriah to David .
10:11:007:0	When Uriah came to him , David asked concerning the welfare of Joab and the people and the state of the war .
10:11:008:0	Then David said to Uriah , “ Go down to your house , and wash your feet . ” And Uriah went out of the king’s house , and a present from the king was sent out after him .
10:11:009:0	But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord , and did not go down to his house .
10:11:010:0	Now when they told David , saying , “ Uriah did not go down to his house , ” David said to Uriah , “ Have you not come from a journey ? Why did you not go down to your house ? ”
10:11:011:0	Uriah said to David , “ The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters , and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field . Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife ? By your life and the life of your soul , I will not do this thing . ”
10:11:012:0	Then David said to Uriah , “ Stay here today also , and tomorrow I will let you go . ” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next .
10:11:013:0	Now David called him , and he ate and drank before him , and he made him drunk ; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his lord’s servants , but he did not go down to his house .
10:11:014:0	Now in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
10:11:015:0	He had written in the letter , saying , “ Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him , so that he may be struck down and die . ”
10:11:016:0	So it was as Joab kept watch on the city , that he put Uriah at the place where he knew there were valiant men .
10:11:017:0	The men of the city went out and fought against Joab , and some of the people among David’s servants fell ; and Uriah the Hittite also died .
10:11:018:0	Then Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war .
10:11:019:0	He charged the messenger , saying , “ When you have finished telling all the events of the war to the king ,
10:11:020:0	and if it happens that the king’s wrath rises and he says to you , ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall ?
10:11:021:0	Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth ? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez ? Why did you go so near the wall ? ’—then you shall say , ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also . ’ ”
10:11:022:0	So the messenger departed and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to tell .
10:11:023:0	The messenger said to David , “ The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field , but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate .
10:11:024:0	Moreover , the archers shot at your servants from the wall ; so some of the king’s servants are dead , and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead . ”
10:11:025:0	Then David said to the messenger , “ Thus you shall say to Joab , ‘Do not let this thing displease you , for the sword devours one as well as another ; make your battle against the city stronger and overthrow it’ ; and so encourage him . ”
10:11:026:0	Now when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
10:11:027:0	When the time of mourning was over , David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife ; then she bore him a son . But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord .
