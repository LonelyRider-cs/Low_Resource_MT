10:12:001:1	Nathan Rebukes David
10:12:001:0	Then the Lord sent Nathan to David . And he came to him and said , “ There were two men in one city , the one rich and the other poor .
10:12:002:0	The rich man had a great many flocks and herds .
10:12:003:0	But the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lambWhich he bought and nourished ; And it grew up together with him and his children . It would eat of his bread and drink of his cup and lie in his bosom , And was like a daughter to him .
10:12:004:0	Now a traveler came to the rich man , And he was unwilling to take from his own flock or his own herd , To prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him ; Rather he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him . ”
10:12:005:0	Then David’s anger burned greatly against the man , and he said to Nathan , “ As the Lord lives , surely the man who has done this deserves to die .
10:12:006:0	He must make restitution for the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing and had no compassion . ”
10:12:007:0	Nathan then said to David , “ You are the man ! Thus says the Lord God of Israel , ‘It is I who anointed you king over Israel and it is I who delivered you from the hand of Saul .
10:12:008:0	I also gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your care , and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would have added to you many more things like these !
10:12:009:0	Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in His sight ? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword , have taken his wife to be your wife , and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon .
10:12:010:0	Now therefore , the sword shall never depart from your house , because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife . ’
10:12:011:0	Thus says the Lord , ‘Behold , I will raise up evil against you from your own household ; I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion , and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight .
10:12:012:0	Indeed you did it secretly , but I will do this thing before all Israel , and under the sun . ’ ”
10:12:013:0	Then David said to Nathan , “ I have sinned against the Lord . ” And Nathan said to David , “ The Lord also has taken away your sin ; you shall not die .
10:12:014:0	However , because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme , the child also that is born to you shall surely die . ”
10:12:002:1	Loss of a Child
10:12:015:0	So Nathan went to his house . Then the Lord struck the child that Uriah’s widow bore to David , so that he was very sick .
10:12:016:0	David therefore inquired of God for the child ; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground .
10:12:017:0	The elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground , but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them .
10:12:018:0	Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died . And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead , for they said , “ Behold , while the child was still alive , we spoke to him and he did not listen to our voice . How then can we tell him that the child is dead , since he might do himself harm ! ”
10:12:019:0	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together , David perceived that the child was dead ; so David said to his servants , “ Is the child dead ? ” And they said , “ He is dead . ”
10:12:020:0	So David arose from the ground , washed , anointed himself , and changed his clothes ; and he came into the house of the Lord and worshiped . Then he came to his own house , and when he requested , they set food before him and he ate .
10:12:021:0	Then his servants said to him , “ What is this thing that you have done ? While the child was alive , you fasted and wept ; but when the child died , you arose and ate food . ”
10:12:022:0	He said , “ While the child was still alive , I fasted and wept ; for I said , ‘Who knows , the Lord may be gracious to me , that the child may live . ’
10:12:003:1	Solomon Born
10:12:023:0	But now he has died ; why should I fast ? Can I bring him back again ? I will go to him , but he will not return to me . ”
10:12:024:0	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba , and went in to her and lay with her ; and she gave birth to a son , and he named him Solomon . Now the Lord loved him
10:12:004:1	War Again
10:12:025:0	and sent word through Nathan the prophet , and he named him Jedidiah for the Lord’s sake .
10:12:026:0	Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and captured the royal city .
10:12:027:0	Joab sent messengers to David and said , “ I have fought against Rabbah , I have even captured the city of waters .
10:12:028:0	Now therefore , gather the rest of the people together and camp against the city and capture it , or I will capture the city myself and it will be named after me . ”
10:12:029:0	So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah , fought against it and captured it .
10:12:030:0	Then he took the crown of their king from his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it was a precious stone ; and it was placed on David’s head . And he brought out the spoil of the city in great amounts .
10:12:031:0	He also brought out the people who were in it , and set them under saws , sharp iron instruments , and iron axes , and made them pass through the brickkiln . And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon . Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
