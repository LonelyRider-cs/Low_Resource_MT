10:15:001:1	Absalom’s Conspiracy
10:15:001:0	Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses and fifty men as runners before him .
10:15:002:0	Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate ; and when any man had a suit to come to the king for judgment , Absalom would call to him and say , “ From what city are you ? ” And he would say , “ Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel . ”
10:15:003:0	Then Absalom would say to him , “ See , your claims are good and right , but no man listens to you on the part of the king . ”
10:15:004:0	Moreover , Absalom would say , “ Oh that one would appoint me judge in the land , then every man who has any suit or cause could come to me and I would give him justice . ”
10:15:005:0	And when a man came near to prostrate himself before him , he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him .
10:15:006:0	In this manner Absalom dealt with all Israel who came to the king for judgment ; so Absalom stole away the hearts of the men of Israel .
10:15:007:0	Now it came about at the end of forty years that Absalom said to the king , “ Please let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed to the Lord , in Hebron .
10:15:008:0	For your servant vowed a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram , saying , ‘If the Lord shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem , then I will serve the Lord . ’ ”
10:15:009:0	The king said to him , “ Go in peace . ” So he arose and went to Hebron .
10:15:010:0	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , “ As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet , then you shall say , ‘Absalom is king in Hebron . ’ ”
10:15:011:0	Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem , who were invited and went innocently , and they did not know anything .
10:15:002:1	David Flees Jerusalem
10:15:012:0	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David’s counselor , from his city Giloh , while he was offering the sacrifices . And the conspiracy was strong , for the people increased continually with Absalom .
10:15:013:0	Then a messenger came to David , saying , “ The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom . ”
10:15:014:0	David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem , “ Arise and let us flee , for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom . Go in haste , or he will overtake us quickly and bring down calamity on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword . ”
10:15:015:0	Then the king’s servants said to the king , “ Behold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses . ”
10:15:016:0	So the king went out and all his household with him . But the king left ten concubines to keep the house .
10:15:017:0	The king went out and all the people with him , and they stopped at the last house .
10:15:018:0	Now all his servants passed on beside him , all the Cherethites , all the Pelethites and all the Gittites , six hundred men who had come with him from Gath , passed on before the king .
10:15:019:0	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite , “ Why will you also go with us ? Return and remain with the king , for you are a foreigner and also an exile ; return to your own place .
10:15:020:0	You came only yesterday , and shall I today make you wander with us , while I go where I will ? Return and take back your brothers ; mercy and truth be with you . ”
10:15:021:0	But Ittai answered the king and said , “ As the Lord lives , and as my lord the king lives , surely wherever my lord the king may be , whether for death or for life , there also your servant will be . ”
10:15:022:0	Therefore David said to Ittai , “ Go and pass over . ” So Ittai the Gittite passed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him .
10:15:023:0	While all the country was weeping with a loud voice , all the people passed over . The king also passed over the brook Kidron , and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness .
10:15:024:0	Now behold , Zadok also came , and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God . And they set down the ark of God , and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished passing from the city .
10:15:025:0	The king said to Zadok , “ Return the ark of God to the city . If I find favor in the sight of the Lord , then He will bring me back again and show me both it and His habitation .
10:15:026:0	But if He should say thus , ‘I have no delight in you , ’ behold , here I am , let Him do to me as seems good to Him . ”
10:15:027:0	The king said also to Zadok the priest , “ Are you not a seer ? Return to the city in peace and your two sons with you , your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
10:15:028:0	See , I am going to wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me . ”
10:15:029:0	Therefore Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there .
10:15:030:0	And David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives , and wept as he went , and his head was covered and he walked barefoot . Then all the people who were with him each covered his head and went up weeping as they went .
10:15:031:0	Now someone told David , saying , “ Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . ” And David said , “ O Lord , I pray , make the counsel of Ahithophel foolishness . ”
10:15:032:0	It happened as David was coming to the summit , where God was worshiped , that behold , Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn and dust on his head .
10:15:033:0	David said to him , “ If you pass over with me , then you will be a burden to me .
10:15:034:0	But if you return to the city , and say to Absalom , ‘I will be your servant , O king ; as I have been your father’s servant in time past , so I will now be your servant , ’ then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me .
10:15:035:0	Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there ? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king’s house , you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
10:15:036:0	Behold their two sons are with them there , Ahimaaz , Zadok’s son and Jonathan , Abiathar’s son ; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear . ”
10:15:037:0	So Hushai , David’s friend , came into the city , and Absalom came into Jerusalem .
