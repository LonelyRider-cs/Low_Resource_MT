10:16:001:1	Ziba , a False Servant
10:16:001:0	Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit , behold , Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys , and on them were two hundred loaves of bread , a hundred clusters of raisins , a hundred summer fruits , and a jug of wine .
10:16:002:0	The king said to Ziba , “ Why do you have these ? ” And Ziba said , “ The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride , and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat , and the wine , for whoever is faint in the wilderness to drink . ”
10:16:003:0	Then the king said , “ And where is your master’s son ? ” And Ziba said to the king , “ Behold , he is staying in Jerusalem , for he said , ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me . ’ ”
10:16:002:1	David Is Cursed
10:16:004:0	So the king said to Ziba , “ Behold , all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours . ” And Ziba said , “ I prostrate myself ; let me find favor in your sight , O my lord , the king ! ”
10:16:005:0	When King David came to Bahurim , behold , there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera ; he came out cursing continually as he came .
10:16:006:0	He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David ; and all the people and all the mighty men were at his right hand and at his left .
10:16:007:0	Thus Shimei said when he cursed , “ Get out , get out , you man of bloodshed , and worthless fellow !
10:16:008:0	The Lord has returned upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul , in whose place you have reigned ; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom . And behold , you are taken in your own evil , for you are a man of bloodshed ! ”
10:16:009:0	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , “ Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? Let me go over now and cut off his head . ”
10:16:010:0	But the king said , “ What have I to do with you , O sons of Zeruiah ? If he curses , and if the Lord has told him , ‘Curse David , ’ then who shall say , ‘Why have you done so ? ’ ”
10:16:011:0	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants , “ Behold , my son who came out from me seeks my life ; how much more now this Benjamite ? Let him alone and let him curse , for the Lord has told him .
10:16:012:0	Perhaps the Lord will look on my affliction and return good to me instead of his cursing this day . ”
10:16:013:0	So David and his men went on the way ; and Shimei went along on the hillside parallel with him and as he went he cursed and cast stones and threw dust at him .
10:16:003:1	Absalom Enters Jerusalem
10:16:014:0	The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary and he refreshed himself there .
10:16:015:0	Then Absalom and all the people , the men of Israel , entered Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
10:16:016:0	Now it came about when Hushai the Archite , David’s friend , came to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , “ Long live the king ! Long live the king ! ”
10:16:017:0	Absalom said to Hushai , “ Is this your loyalty to your friend ? Why did you not go with your friend ? ”
10:16:018:0	Then Hushai said to Absalom , “ No ! For whom the Lord , this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his I will be , and with him I will remain .
10:16:019:0	Besides , whom should I serve ? Should I not serve in the presence of his son ? As I have served in your father’s presence , so I will be in your presence . ”
10:16:020:0	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel , “ Give your advice . What shall we do ? ”
10:16:021:0	Ahithophel said to Absalom , “ Go in to your father’s concubines , whom he has left to keep the house ; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father . The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened . ”
10:16:022:0	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof , and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel .
10:16:023:0	The advice of Ahithophel , which he gave in those days , was as if one inquired of the word of God ; so was all the advice of Ahithophel regarded by both David and Absalom .
