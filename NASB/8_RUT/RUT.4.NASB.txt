8:4:001:1	The Marriage of Ruth
8:4:001:0	Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there , and behold , the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by , so he said , “ Turn aside , friend , sit down here . ” And he turned aside and sat down .
8:4:002:0	He took ten men of the elders of the city and said , “ Sit down here . ” So they sat down .
8:4:003:0	Then he said to the closest relative , “ Naomi , who has come back from the land of Moab , has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech .
8:4:004:0	So I thought to inform you , saying , ‘Buy it before those who are sitting here , and before the elders of my people . If you will redeem it , redeem it ; but if not , tell me that I may know ; for there is no one but you to redeem it , and I am after you . ’ ” And he said , “ I will redeem it . ”
8:4:005:0	Then Boaz said , “ On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi , you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess , the widow of the deceased , in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance . ”
8:4:006:0	The closest relative said , “ I cannot redeem it for myself , because I would jeopardize my own inheritance . Redeem it for yourself ; you may have my right of redemption , for I cannot redeem it . ”
8:4:007:0	Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange of land to confirm any matter : a man removed his sandal and gave it to another ; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel .
8:4:008:0	So the closest relative said to Boaz , “ Buy it for yourself . ” And he removed his sandal .
8:4:009:0	Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people , “ You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon .
8:4:010:0	Moreover , I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess , the widow of Mahlon , to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance , so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his birth place ; you are witnesses today . ”
8:4:011:0	All the people who were in the court , and the elders , said , “ We are witnesses . May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah , both of whom built the house of Israel ; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem .
8:4:012:0	Moreover , may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah , through the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman . ”
8:4:013:0	So Boaz took Ruth , and she became his wife , and he went in to her . And the Lord enabled her to conceive , and she gave birth to a son .
8:4:014:0	Then the women said to Naomi , “ Blessed is the Lord who has not left you without a redeemer today , and may his name become famous in Israel .
8:4:002:1	The Line of David Began Here
8:4:015:0	May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age ; for your daughter-in-law , who loves you and is better to you than seven sons , has given birth to him . ”
8:4:016:0	Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap , and became his nurse .
8:4:017:0	The neighbor women gave him a name , saying , “ A son has been born to Naomi ! ” So they named him Obed . He is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
8:4:018:0	Now these are the generations of Perez : to Perez was born Hezron ,
8:4:019:0	and to Hezron was born Ram , and to Ram , Amminadab ,
8:4:020:0	and to Amminadab was born Nahshon , and to Nahshon , Salmon ,
8:4:021:0	and to Salmon was born Boaz , and to Boaz , Obed ,
8:4:022:0	and to Obed was born Jesse , and to Jesse , David .
