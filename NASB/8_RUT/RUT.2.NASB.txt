8:2:001:1	Ruth Gleans in Boaz’ Field
8:2:001:0	Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband , a man of great wealth , of the family of Elimelech , whose name was Boaz .
8:2:002:0	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , “ Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor . ” And she said to her , “ Go , my daughter . ”
8:2:003:0	So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers ; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
8:2:004:0	Now behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers , “ May the Lord be with you . ” And they said to him , “ May the Lord bless you . ”
8:2:005:0	Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers , “ Whose young woman is this ? ”
8:2:006:0	The servant in charge of the reapers replied , “ She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab .
8:2:007:0	And she said , ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves . ’ Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now ; she has been sitting in the house for a little while . ”
8:2:008:0	Then Boaz said to Ruth , “ Listen carefully , my daughter . Do not go to glean in another field ; furthermore , do not go on from this one , but stay here with my maids .
8:2:009:0	Let your eyes be on the field which they reap , and go after them . Indeed , I have commanded the servants not to touch you . When you are thirsty , go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw . ”
8:2:010:0	Then she fell on her face , bowing to the ground and said to him , “ Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me , since I am a foreigner ? ”
8:2:011:0	Boaz replied to her , “ All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me , and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth , and came to a people that you did not previously know .
8:2:012:0	May the Lord reward your work , and your wages be full from the Lord , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to seek refuge . ”
8:2:013:0	Then she said , “ I have found favor in your sight , my lord , for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant , though I am not like one of your maidservants . ”
8:2:014:0	At mealtime Boaz said to her , “ Come here , that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar . ” So she sat beside the reapers ; and he served her roasted grain , and she ate and was satisfied and had some left .
8:2:015:0	When she rose to glean , Boaz commanded his servants , saying , “ Let her glean even among the sheaves , and do not insult her .
8:2:016:0	Also you shall purposely pull out for her some grain from the bundles and leave it that she may glean , and do not rebuke her . ”
8:2:017:0	So she gleaned in the field until evening . Then she beat out what she had gleaned , and it was about an ephah of barley .
8:2:018:0	She took it up and went into the city , and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned . She also took it out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied .
8:2:019:0	Her mother-in-law then said to her , “ Where did you glean today and where did you work ? May he who took notice of you be blessed . ” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said , “ The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz . ”
8:2:020:0	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law , “ May he be blessed of the Lord who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead . ” Again Naomi said to her , “ The man is our relative , he is one of our closest relatives . ”
8:2:021:0	Then Ruth the Moabitess said , “ Furthermore , he said to me , ‘You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest . ’ ”
8:2:022:0	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , “ It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his maids , so that others do not fall upon you in another field . ”
8:2:023:0	So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest . And she lived with her mother-in-law .
