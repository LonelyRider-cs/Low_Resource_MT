14:25:001:1	Amaziah Succeeds Joash in Judah
14:25:001:0	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem . And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
14:25:002:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord , yet not with a whole heart .
14:25:003:0	Now it came about as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp , that he killed his servants who had slain his father the king .
14:25:002:1	Amaziah Defeats Edomites
14:25:004:0	However , he did not put their children to death , but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses , which the Lord commanded , saying , “ Fathers shall not be put to death for sons , nor sons be put to death for fathers , but each shall be put to death for his own sin . ”
14:25:005:0	Moreover , Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according to their fathers’ households under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin ; and he took a census of those from twenty years old and upward and found them to be 300 , 000 choice men , able to go to war and handle spear and shield .
14:25:006:0	He hired also 100 , 000 valiant warriors out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver .
14:25:007:0	But a man of God came to him saying , “ O king , do not let the army of Israel go with you , for the Lord is not with Israel nor with any of the sons of Ephraim .
14:25:008:0	But if you do go , do it , be strong for the battle ; yet God will bring you down before the enemy , for God has power to help and to bring down . ”
14:25:009:0	Amaziah said to the man of God , “ But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel ? ” And the man of God answered , “ The Lord has much more to give you than this . ”
14:25:010:0	Then Amaziah dismissed them , the troops which came to him from Ephraim , to go home ; so their anger burned against Judah and they returned home in fierce anger .
14:25:011:0	Now Amaziah strengthened himself and led his people forth , and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10 , 000 of the sons of Seir .
14:25:012:0	The sons of Judah also captured 10 , 000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff and threw them down from the top of the cliff , so that they were all dashed to pieces .
14:25:003:1	Amaziah Rebuked for Idolatry
14:25:013:0	But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle , raided the cities of Judah , from Samaria to Beth-horon , and struck down 3 , 000 of them and plundered much spoil .
14:25:014:0	Now after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites , he brought the gods of the sons of Seir , set them up as his gods , bowed down before them and burned incense to them .
14:25:015:0	Then the anger of the Lord burned against Amaziah , and He sent him a prophet who said to him , “ Why have you sought the gods of the people who have not delivered their own people from your hand ? ”
14:25:004:1	Amaziah Defeated by Joash of Israel
14:25:016:0	As he was talking with him , the king said to him , “ Have we appointed you a royal counselor ? Stop ! Why should you be struck down ? ” Then the prophet stopped and said , “ I know that God has planned to destroy you , because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel . ”
14:25:017:0	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu , the king of Israel , saying , “ Come , let us face each other . ”
14:25:018:0	Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , “ The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon , saying , ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage . ’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trampled the thorn bush .
14:25:019:0	You said , ‘Behold , you have defeated Edom . ’ And your heart has become proud in boasting . Now stay at home ; for why should you provoke trouble so that you , even you , would fall and Judah with you ? ”
14:25:020:0	But Amaziah would not listen , for it was from God , that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom .
14:25:021:0	So Joash king of Israel went up , and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh , which belonged to Judah .
14:25:022:0	Judah was defeated by Israel , and they fled each to his tent .
14:25:023:0	Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth-shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate , 400 cubits .
14:25:024:0	He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom , and the treasures of the king’s house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
14:25:025:0	And Amaziah , the son of Joash king of Judah , lived fifteen years after the death of Joash , son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel .
14:25:026:0	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , from first to last , behold , are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel ?
14:25:027:0	From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord they conspired against him in Jerusalem , and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there .
14:25:028:0	Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah .
