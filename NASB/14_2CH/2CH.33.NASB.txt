14:33:001:1	Manasseh Succeeds Hezekiah in Judah
14:33:001:0	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king , and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
14:33:002:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord dispossessed before the sons of Israel .
14:33:003:0	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down ; he also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherim , and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
14:33:004:0	He built altars in the house of the Lord of which the Lord had said , “ My name shall be in Jerusalem forever . ”
14:33:005:0	For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
14:33:006:0	He made his sons pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom ; and he practiced witchcraft , used divination , practiced sorcery and dealt with mediums and spiritists . He did much evil in the sight of the Lord , provoking Him to anger .
14:33:007:0	Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God , of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son , “ In this house and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel , I will put My name forever ;
14:33:008:0	and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers , if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them according to all the law , the statutes and the ordinances given through Moses . ”
14:33:002:1	Manasseh’s Idolatry Rebuked
14:33:009:0	Thus Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the sons of Israel .
14:33:010:0	The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people , but they paid no attention .
14:33:011:0	Therefore the Lord brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria against them , and they captured Manasseh with hooks , bound him with bronze chains and took him to Babylon .
14:33:012:0	When he was in distress , he entreated the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers .
14:33:013:0	When he prayed to Him , He was moved by his entreaty and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem to his kingdom . Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God .
14:33:014:0	Now after this he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon , in the valley , even to the entrance of the Fish Gate ; and he encircled the Ophel with it and made it very high . Then he put army commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah .
14:33:015:0	He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord , as well as all the altars which he had built on the mountain of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem , and he threw them outside the city .
14:33:016:0	He set up the altar of the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it ; and he ordered Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel .
14:33:017:0	Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places , although only to the Lord their God .
14:33:018:0	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh even his prayer to his God , and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , behold , they are among the records of the kings of Israel .
14:33:019:0	His prayer also and how God was entreated by him , and all his sin , his unfaithfulness , and the sites on which he built high places and erected the Asherim and the carved images , before he humbled himself , behold , they are written in the records of the Hozai .
14:33:003:1	Amon Becomes King in Judah
14:33:020:0	So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house . And Amon his son became king in his place .
14:33:021:0	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem .
14:33:022:0	He did evil in the sight of the Lord as Manasseh his father had done , and Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made , and he served them .
14:33:023:0	Moreover , he did not humble himself before the Lord as his father Manasseh had done , but Amon multiplied guilt .
14:33:024:0	Finally his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house .
14:33:025:0	But the people of the land killed all the conspirators against King Amon , and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place .
