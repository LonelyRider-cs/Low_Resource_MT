14:35:001:1	The Passover Observed Again
14:35:001:0	Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem , and they slaughtered the Passover animals on the fourteenth day of the first month .
14:35:002:0	He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the Lord .
14:35:003:0	He also said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the Lord , “ Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built ; it will be a burden on your shoulders no longer . Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel .
14:35:004:0	Prepare yourselves by your fathers’ households in your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of his son Solomon .
14:35:005:0	Moreover , stand in the holy place according to the sections of the fathers’ households of your brethren the lay people , and according to the Levites , by division of a father’s household .
14:35:006:0	Now slaughter the Passover animals , sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of the Lord by Moses . ”
14:35:007:0	Josiah contributed to the lay people , to all who were present , flocks of lambs and young goats , all for the Passover offerings , numbering 30 , 000 plus 3 , 000 bulls ; these were from the king’s possessions .
14:35:008:0	His officers also contributed a freewill offering to the people , the priests and the Levites . Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , the officials of the house of God , gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2 , 600 from the flocks and 300 bulls .
14:35:009:0	Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethanel , his brothers , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , the officers of the Levites , contributed to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5 , 000 from the flocks and 500 bulls .
14:35:010:0	So the service was prepared , and the priests stood at their stations and the Levites by their divisions according to the king’s command .
14:35:011:0	They slaughtered the Passover animals , and while the priests sprinkled the blood received from their hand , the Levites skinned them .
14:35:012:0	Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the sections of the fathers’ households of the lay people to present to the Lord , as it is written in the book of Moses . They did this also with the bulls .
14:35:013:0	So they roasted the Passover animals on the fire according to the ordinance , and they boiled the holy things in pots , in kettles , in pans , and carried them speedily to all the lay people .
14:35:014:0	Afterwards they prepared for themselves and for the priests , because the priests , the sons of Aaron , were offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests , the sons of Aaron .
14:35:015:0	The singers , the sons of Asaph , were also at their stations according to the command of David , Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun the king’s seer ; and the gatekeepers at each gate did not have to depart from their service , because the Levites their brethren prepared for them .
14:35:016:0	So all the service of the Lord was prepared on that day to celebrate the Passover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord according to the command of King Josiah .
14:35:017:0	Thus the sons of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time , and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days .
14:35:018:0	There had not been celebrated a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet ; nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests , the Levites , all Judah and Israel who were present , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
14:35:002:1	Josiah Dies in Battle
14:35:019:0	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign this Passover was celebrated .
14:35:020:0	After all this , when Josiah had set the temple in order , Neco king of Egypt came up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates , and Josiah went out to engage him .
14:35:021:0	But Neco sent messengers to him , saying , “ What have we to do with each other , O King of Judah ? I am not coming against you today but against the house with which I am at war , and God has ordered me to hurry . Stop for your own sake from interfering with God who is with me , so that He will not destroy you . ”
14:35:022:0	However , Josiah would not turn away from him , but disguised himself in order to make war with him ; nor did he listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God , but came to make war on the plain of Megiddo .
14:35:023:0	The archers shot King Josiah , and the king said to his servants , “ Take me away , for I am badly wounded . ”
14:35:024:0	So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in the second chariot which he had , and brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers . All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
14:35:025:0	Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah . And all the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations to this day . And they made them an ordinance in Israel ; behold , they are also written in the Lamentations .
14:35:026:0	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of the Lord ,
14:35:027:0	and his acts , first to last , behold , they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah .
