14:1:001:1	Solomon Worships at Gibeon
14:1:001:0	Now Solomon the son of David established himself securely over his kingdom , and the Lord his God was with him and exalted him greatly .
14:1:002:0	Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every leader in all Israel , the heads of the fathers’ households .
14:1:003:0	Then Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place which was at Gibeon , for God’s tent of meeting was there , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
14:1:004:0	However , David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it , for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem .
14:1:005:0	Now the bronze altar , which Bezalel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of the Lord , and Solomon and the assembly sought it out .
14:1:006:0	Solomon went up there before the Lord to the bronze altar which was at the tent of meeting , and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it .
14:1:002:1	Solomon’s Prayer for Wisdom
14:1:007:0	In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him , “ Ask what I shall give you . ”
14:1:008:0	Solomon said to God , “ You have dealt with my father David with great lovingkindness , and have made me king in his place .
14:1:009:0	Now , O Lord God , Your promise to my father David is fulfilled , for You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth .
14:1:010:0	Give me now wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people , for who can rule this great people of Yours ? ”
14:1:011:0	God said to Solomon , “ Because you had this in mind , and did not ask for riches , wealth or honor , or the life of those who hate you , nor have you even asked for long life , but you have asked for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may rule My people over whom I have made you king ,
14:1:012:0	wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you . And I will give you riches and wealth and honor , such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed nor those who will come after you . ”
14:1:003:1	Solomon’s Wealth
14:1:013:0	So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon , from the tent of meeting , to Jerusalem , and he reigned over Israel .
14:1:014:0	Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen . He had 1 , 400 chariots and 12 , 000 horsemen , and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem .
14:1:015:0	The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones , and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland .
14:1:016:0	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue ; the king’s traders procured them from Kue for a price .
14:1:017:0	They imported chariots from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver apiece and horses for 150 apiece , and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram .
