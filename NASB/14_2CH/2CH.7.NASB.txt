14:7:001:1	The Shekinah Glory
14:7:001:0	Now when Solomon had finished praying , fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices , and the glory of the Lord filled the house .
14:7:002:0	The priests could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled the Lord’s house .
14:7:002:1	Sacrifices Offered
14:7:003:0	All the sons of Israel , seeing the fire come down and the glory of the Lord upon the house , bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground , and they worshiped and gave praise to the Lord , saying , “ Truly He is good , truly His lovingkindness is everlasting . ”
14:7:004:0	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the Lord .
14:7:005:0	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22 , 000 oxen and 120 , 000 sheep . Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
14:7:006:0	The priests stood at their posts , and the Levites also , with the instruments of music to the Lord , which King David had made for giving praise to the Lord— “ for His lovingkindness is everlasting ” —whenever he gave praise by their means , while the priests on the other side blew trumpets ; and all Israel was standing .
14:7:003:1	The Feast of Dedication
14:7:007:0	Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord , for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering , the grain offering and the fat .
14:7:008:0	So Solomon observed the feast at that time for seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly who came from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt .
14:7:009:0	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly , for the dedication of the altar they observed seven days and the feast seven days .
14:7:004:1	God’s Promise and Warning
14:7:010:0	Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their tents , rejoicing and happy of heart because of the goodness that the Lord had shown to David and to Solomon and to His people Israel .
14:7:011:0	Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king’s palace , and successfully completed all that he had planned on doing in the house of the Lord and in his palace .
14:7:012:0	Then the Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice .
14:7:013:0	If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain , or if I command the locust to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among My people ,
14:7:014:0	and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways , then I will hear from heaven , will forgive their sin and will heal their land .
14:7:015:0	Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place .
14:7:016:0	For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that My name may be there forever , and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually .
14:7:017:0	As for you , if you walk before Me as your father David walked , even to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep My statutes and My ordinances ,
14:7:018:0	then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David , saying , ‘You shall not lack a man to be ruler in Israel . ’
14:7:019:0	“ But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you , and go and serve other gods and worship them ,
14:7:020:0	then I will uproot you from My land which I have given you , and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
14:7:021:0	As for this house , which was exalted , everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say , ‘Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house ? ’
14:7:022:0	And they will say , ‘Because they forsook the Lord , the God of their fathers who brought them from the land of Egypt , and they adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them ; therefore He has brought all this adversity on them . ’ ”
