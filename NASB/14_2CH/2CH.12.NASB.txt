14:12:001:1	Shishak of Egypt Invades Judah
14:12:001:0	When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong , he and all Israel with him forsook the law of the Lord .
14:12:002:0	And it came about in King Rehoboam’s fifth year , because they had been unfaithful to the Lord , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
14:12:003:0	with 1 , 200 chariots and 60 , 000 horsemen . And the people who came with him from Egypt were without number : the Lubim , the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians .
14:12:004:0	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem .
14:12:005:0	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak , and he said to them , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘You have forsaken Me , so I also have forsaken you to Shishak . ’ ”
14:12:006:0	So the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said , “ The Lord is righteous . ”
14:12:007:0	When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah , saying , “ They have humbled themselves so I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some measure of deliverance , and My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak .
14:12:002:1	Plunder Impoverishes Judah
14:12:008:0	But they will become his slaves so that they may learn the difference between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries . ”
14:12:009:0	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s palace . He took everything ; he even took the golden shields which Solomon had made .
14:12:010:0	Then King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the door of the king’s house .
14:12:011:0	As often as the king entered the house of the Lord , the guards came and carried them and then brought them back into the guards’ room .
14:12:012:0	And when he humbled himself , the anger of the Lord turned away from him , so as not to destroy him completely ; and also conditions were good in Judah .
14:12:013:0	So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned . Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel , to put His name there . And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess .
14:12:014:0	He did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the Lord .
14:12:015:0	Now the acts of Rehoboam , from first to last , are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer , according to genealogical enrollment ? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
14:12:016:0	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David ; and his son Abijah became king in his place .
