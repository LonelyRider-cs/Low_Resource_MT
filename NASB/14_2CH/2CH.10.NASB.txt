14:10:001:1	Rehoboam’s Reign of Folly
14:10:001:0	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem , for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king .
14:10:002:0	When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it ( for he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon ) , Jeroboam returned from Egypt .
14:10:003:0	So they sent and summoned him . When Jeroboam and all Israel came , they spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
14:10:004:0	“ Your father made our yoke hard ; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us , and we will serve you . ”
14:10:005:0	He said to them , “ Return to me again in three days . ” So the people departed .
14:10:006:0	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive , saying , “ How do you counsel me to answer this people ? ”
14:10:007:0	They spoke to him , saying , “ If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . ”
14:10:008:0	But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him , and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him .
14:10:009:0	So he said to them , “ What counsel do you give that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’ ? ”
14:10:010:0	The young men who grew up with him spoke to him , saying , “ Thus you shall say to the people who spoke to you , saying , ‘Your father made our yoke heavy , but you make it lighter for us . ’ Thus you shall say to them , ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins !
14:10:011:0	Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke ; my father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions . ’ ”
14:10:012:0	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed , saying , “ Return to me on the third day . ”
14:10:013:0	The king answered them harshly , and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders .
14:10:014:0	He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men , saying , “ My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add to it ; my father disciplined you with whips , but I will discipline you with scorpions . ”
14:10:015:0	So the king did not listen to the people , for it was a turn of events from God that the Lord might establish His word , which He spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
14:10:016:0	When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them the people answered the king , saying , “ What portion do we have in David ? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse . Every man to your tents , O Israel ; Now look after your own house , David . ” So all Israel departed to their tents .
14:10:017:0	But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
14:10:018:0	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was over the forced labor , and the sons of Israel stoned him to death . And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem .
14:10:019:0	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
