14:18:001:1	Jehoshaphat Allies with Ahab
14:18:001:0	Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor ; and he allied himself by marriage with Ahab .
14:18:002:0	Some years later he went down to visit Ahab at Samaria . And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him , and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead .
14:18:003:0	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah , “ Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead ? ” And he said to him , “ I am as you are , and my people as your people , and we will be with you in the battle . ”
14:18:004:0	Moreover , Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , “ Please inquire first for the word of the Lord . ”
14:18:005:0	Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets , four hundred men , and said to them , “ Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle , or shall I refrain ? ” And they said , “ Go up , for God will give it into the hand of the king . ”
14:18:006:0	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Is there not yet a prophet of the Lord here that we may inquire of him ? ”
14:18:002:1	Ahab’s False Prophets Assure Victory
14:18:007:0	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord , but I hate him , for he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil . He is Micaiah , son of Imla . ” But Jehoshaphat said , “ Let not the king say so . ”
14:18:008:0	Then the king of Israel called an officer and said , “ Bring quickly Micaiah , Imla’s son . ”
14:18:009:0	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne , arrayed in their robes , and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets were prophesying before them .
14:18:010:0	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said , “ Thus says the Lord , ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are consumed . ’ ”
14:18:003:1	Micaiah Brings Word from God
14:18:011:0	All the prophets were prophesying thus , saying , “ Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed , for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king . ”
14:18:012:0	Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying , “ Behold , the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king . So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably . ”
14:18:013:0	But Micaiah said , “ As the Lord lives , what my God says , that I will speak . ”
14:18:014:0	When he came to the king , the king said to him , “ Micaiah , shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle , or shall I refrain ? ” He said , “ Go up and succeed , for they will be given into your hand . ”
14:18:015:0	Then the king said to him , “ How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ”
14:18:016:0	So he said , “ I saw all IsraelScattered on the mountains , Like sheep which have no shepherd ; And the Lord said , ‘These have no master . Let each of them return to his house in peace . ’ ”
14:18:017:0	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me , but evil ? ”
14:18:018:0	Micaiah said , “ Therefore , hear the word of the Lord . I saw the Lord sitting on His throne , and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left .
14:18:019:0	The Lord said , ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead ? ’ And one said this while another said that .
14:18:020:0	Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said , ‘I will entice him . ’ And the Lord said to him , ‘How ? ’
14:18:021:0	He said , ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . ’ Then He said , ‘You are to entice him and prevail also . Go and do so . ’
14:18:022:0	Now therefore , behold , the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of these your prophets , for the Lord has proclaimed disaster against you . ”
14:18:023:0	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said , “ How did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you ? ”
14:18:024:0	Micaiah said , “ Behold , you will see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself . ”
14:18:025:0	Then the king of Israel said , “ Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son ;
14:18:026:0	and say , ‘Thus says the king , “ Put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely . ” ’ ”
14:18:004:1	Ahab’s Defeat and Death
14:18:027:0	Micaiah said , “ If you indeed return safely , the Lord has not spoken by me . ” And he said , “ Listen , all you people . ”
14:18:028:0	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead .
14:18:029:0	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will disguise myself and go into battle , but you put on your robes . ” So the king of Israel disguised himself , and they went into battle .
14:18:030:0	Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots , saying , “ Do not fight with small or great , but with the king of Israel alone . ”
14:18:031:0	So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , they said , “ It is the king of Israel , ” and they turned aside to fight against him . But Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him , and God diverted them from him .
14:18:032:0	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back from pursuing him .
14:18:033:0	A certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor . So he said to the driver of the chariot , “ Turn around and take me out of the fight , for I am severely wounded . ”
14:18:034:0	The battle raged that day , and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans until the evening ; and at sunset he died .
