14:26:001:1	Uzziah Succeeds Amaziah in Judah
14:26:001:0	And all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah .
14:26:002:0	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers .
14:26:003:0	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king , and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem ; and his mother’s name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem .
14:26:004:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
14:26:002:1	Uzziah Succeeds in War
14:26:005:0	He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding through the vision of God ; and as long as he sought the Lord , God prospered him .
14:26:006:0	Now he went out and warred against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod ; and he built cities in the area of Ashdod and among the Philistines .
14:26:007:0	God helped him against the Philistines , and against the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal , and the Meunites .
14:26:008:0	The Ammonites also gave tribute to Uzziah , and his fame extended to the border of Egypt , for he became very strong .
14:26:009:0	Moreover , Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the corner buttress and fortified them .
14:26:010:0	He built towers in the wilderness and hewed many cisterns , for he had much livestock , both in the lowland and in the plain . He also had plowmen and vinedressers in the hill country and the fertile fields , for he loved the soil .
14:26:011:0	Moreover , Uzziah had an army ready for battle , which entered combat by divisions according to the number of their muster , prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official , under the direction of Hananiah , one of the king’s officers .
14:26:012:0	The total number of the heads of the households , of valiant warriors , was 2 , 600 .
14:26:013:0	Under their direction was an elite army of 307 , 500 , who could wage war with great power , to help the king against the enemy .
14:26:014:0	Moreover , Uzziah prepared for all the army shields , spears , helmets , body armor , bows and sling stones .
14:26:003:1	Pride Is Uzziah’s Undoing
14:26:015:0	In Jerusalem he made engines of war invented by skillful men to be on the towers and on the corners for the purpose of shooting arrows and great stones . Hence his fame spread afar , for he was marvelously helped until he was strong .
14:26:016:0	But when he became strong , his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly , and he was unfaithful to the Lord his God , for he entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense .
14:26:017:0	Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the Lord , valiant men .
14:26:018:0	They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him , “ It is not for you , Uzziah , to burn incense to the Lord , but for the priests , the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense . Get out of the sanctuary , for you have been unfaithful and will have no honor from the Lord God . ”
14:26:019:0	But Uzziah , with a censer in his hand for burning incense , was enraged ; and while he was enraged with the priests , the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord , beside the altar of incense .
14:26:020:0	Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him , and behold , he was leprous on his forehead ; and they hurried him out of there , and he himself also hastened to get out because the Lord had smitten him .
14:26:021:0	King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death ; and he lived in a separate house , being a leper , for he was cut off from the house of the Lord . And Jotham his son was over the king’s house judging the people of the land .
14:26:022:0	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first to last , the prophet Isaiah , the son of Amoz , has written .
14:26:023:0	So Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings , for they said , “ He is a leper . ” And Jotham his son became king in his place .
