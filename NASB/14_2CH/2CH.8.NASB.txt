14:8:001:1	Solomon’s Activities and Accomplishments
14:8:001:0	Now it came about at the end of the twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the Lord and his own house
14:8:002:0	that he built the cities which Huram had given to him , and settled the sons of Israel there .
14:8:003:0	Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it .
14:8:004:0	He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he had built in Hamath .
14:8:005:0	He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon , fortified cities with walls , gates and bars ;
14:8:006:0	and Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen , and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem , in Lebanon , and in all the land under his rule .
14:8:007:0	All of the people who were left of the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perizzites , the Hivites and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ,
14:8:008:0	namely , from their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had not destroyed , them Solomon raised as forced laborers to this day .
14:8:009:0	But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel ; they were men of war , his chief captains and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen .
14:8:010:0	These were the chief officers of King Solomon , two hundred and fifty who ruled over the people .
14:8:011:0	Then Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her , for he said , “ My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel , because the places are holy where the ark of the Lord has entered . ”
14:8:012:0	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord which he had built before the porch ;
14:8:013:0	and did so according to the daily rule , offering them up according to the commandment of Moses , for the sabbaths , the new moons and the three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths .
14:8:014:0	Now according to the ordinance of his father David , he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service , and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministering before the priests according to the daily rule , and the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate ; for David the man of God had so commanded .
14:8:015:0	And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites in any manner or concerning the storehouses .
14:8:016:0	Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out from the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and until it was finished . So the house of the Lord was completed .
14:8:017:0	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom .
14:8:018:0	And Huram by his servants sent him ships and servants who knew the sea ; and they went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir , and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon .
