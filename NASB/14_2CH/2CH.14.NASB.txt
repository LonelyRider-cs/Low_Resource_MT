14:14:001:1	Asa Succeeds Abijah in Judah
14:14:001:0	So Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David , and his son Asa became king in his place . The land was undisturbed for ten years during his days .
14:14:002:0	Asa did good and right in the sight of the Lord his God ,
14:14:003:0	for he removed the foreign altars and high places , tore down the sacred pillars , cut down the Asherim ,
14:14:004:0	and commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment .
14:14:005:0	He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah . And the kingdom was undisturbed under him .
14:14:006:0	He built fortified cities in Judah , since the land was undisturbed , and there was no one at war with him during those years , because the Lord had given him rest .
14:14:007:0	For he said to Judah , “ Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers , gates and bars . The land is still ours because we have sought the Lord our God ; we have sought Him , and He has given us rest on every side . ” So they built and prospered .
14:14:008:0	Now Asa had an army of 300 , 000 from Judah , bearing large shields and spears , and 280 , 000 from Benjamin , bearing shields and wielding bows ; all of them were valiant warriors .
14:14:009:0	Now Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots , and he came to Mareshah .
14:14:010:0	So Asa went out to meet him , and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
14:14:011:0	Then Asa called to the Lord his God and said , “ Lord , there is no one besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength ; so help us , O Lord our God , for we trust in You , and in Your name have come against this multitude . O Lord , You are our God ; let not man prevail against You . ”
14:14:012:0	So the Lord routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah , and the Ethiopians fled .
14:14:013:0	Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar ; and so many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover , for they were shattered before the Lord and before His army . And they carried away very much plunder .
14:14:014:0	They destroyed all the cities around Gerar , for the dread of the Lord had fallen on them ; and they despoiled all the cities , for there was much plunder in them .
14:14:015:0	They also struck down those who owned livestock , and they carried away large numbers of sheep and camels . Then they returned to Jerusalem .
