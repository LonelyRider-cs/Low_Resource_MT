14:17:001:1	Jehoshaphat Succeeds Asa
14:17:001:0	Jehoshaphat his son then became king in his place , and made his position over Israel firm .
14:17:002:1	His Good Reign
14:17:002:0	He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had captured .
14:17:003:0	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father David’s earlier days and did not seek the Baals ,
14:17:004:0	but sought the God of his father , followed His commandments , and did not act as Israel did .
14:17:005:0	So the Lord established the kingdom in his control , and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat , and he had great riches and honor .
14:17:006:0	He took great pride in the ways of the Lord and again removed the high places and the Asherim from Judah .
14:17:007:0	Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials , Ben-hail , Obadiah , Zechariah , Nethanel and Micaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
14:17:008:0	and with them the Levites , Shemaiah , Nethaniah , Zebadiah , Asahel , Shemiramoth , Jehonathan , Adonijah , Tobijah and Tobadonijah , the Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , the priests .
14:17:009:0	They taught in Judah , having the book of the law of the Lord with them ; and they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people .
14:17:010:0	Now the dread of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands which were around Judah , so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat .
14:17:011:0	Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat ; the Arabians also brought him flocks , 7 , 700 rams and 7 , 700 male goats .
14:17:012:0	So Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater , and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah .
14:17:013:0	He had large supplies in the cities of Judah , and warriors , valiant men , in Jerusalem .
14:17:014:0	This was their muster according to their fathers’ households : of Judah , commanders of thousands , Adnah was the commander , and with him 300 , 000 valiant warriors ;
14:17:015:0	and next to him was Johanan the commander , and with him 280 , 000 ;
14:17:016:0	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri , who volunteered for the Lord , and with him 200 , 000 valiant warriors ;
14:17:017:0	and of Benjamin , Eliada a valiant warrior , and with him 200 , 000 armed with bow and shield ;
14:17:018:0	and next to him Jehozabad , and with him 180 , 000 equipped for war .
14:17:019:0	These are they who served the king , apart from those whom the king put in the fortified cities through all Judah .
