14:19:001:1	Jehu Rebukes Jehoshaphat
14:19:001:0	Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem .
14:19:002:0	Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat , “ Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord and so bring wrath on yourself from the Lord ?
14:19:003:0	But there is some good in you , for you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have set your heart to seek God . ”
14:19:002:1	Reforms Instituted
14:19:004:0	So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the Lord , the God of their fathers .
14:19:005:0	He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah , city by city .
14:19:006:0	He said to the judges , “ Consider what you are doing , for you do not judge for man but for the Lord who is with you when you render judgment .
14:19:007:0	Now then let the fear of the Lord be upon you ; be very careful what you do , for the Lord our God will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of a bribe . ”
14:19:008:0	In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests , and some of the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel , for the judgment of the Lord and to judge disputes among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
14:19:009:0	Then he charged them saying , “ Thus you shall do in the fear of the Lord , faithfully and wholeheartedly .
14:19:010:0	Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities , between blood and blood , between law and commandment , statutes and ordinances , you shall warn them so that they may not be guilty before the Lord , and wrath may not come on you and your brethren . Thus you shall do and you will not be guilty .
14:19:011:0	Behold , Amariah the chief priest will be over you in all that pertains to the Lord , and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the ruler of the house of Judah , in all that pertains to the king . Also the Levites shall be officers before you . Act resolutely , and the Lord be with the upright . ”
