14:27:001:1	Jotham Succeeds Uzziah in Judah
14:27:001:0	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . And his motherâ€™s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok .
14:27:002:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uzziah had done ; however he did not enter the temple of the Lord . But the people continued acting corruptly .
14:27:003:0	He built the upper gate of the house of the Lord , and he built extensively the wall of Ophel .
14:27:004:0	Moreover , he built cities in the hill country of Judah , and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded hills .
14:27:005:0	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that the Ammonites gave him during that year one hundred talents of silver , ten thousand kors of wheat and ten thousand of barley . The Ammonites also paid him this amount in the second and in the third year .
14:27:006:0	So Jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the Lord his God .
14:27:007:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham , even all his wars and his acts , behold , they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah .
14:27:008:0	He was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
14:27:009:0	And Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and Ahaz his son became king in his place .
