14:29:001:1	Hezekiah Succeeds Ahaz in Judah
14:29:001:0	Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old ; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem . And his mother’s name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
14:29:002:0	He did right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father David had done .
14:29:003:0	In the first year of his reign , in the first month , he opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them .
14:29:002:1	Reforms Begun
14:29:004:0	He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them into the square on the east .
14:29:005:0	Then he said to them , “ Listen to me , O Levites . Consecrate yourselves now , and consecrate the house of the Lord , the God of your fathers , and carry the uncleanness out from the holy place .
14:29:006:0	For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the Lord our God , and have forsaken Him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the Lord , and have turned their backs .
14:29:007:0	They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
14:29:008:0	Therefore the wrath of the Lord was against Judah and Jerusalem , and He has made them an object of terror , of horror , and of hissing , as you see with your own eyes .
14:29:009:0	For behold , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
14:29:010:0	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel , that His burning anger may turn away from us .
14:29:011:0	My sons , do not be negligent now , for the Lord has chosen you to stand before Him , to minister to Him , and to be His ministers and burn incense . ”
14:29:012:0	Then the Levites arose : Mahath , the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah , from the sons of the Kohathites ; and from the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel ; and from the Gershonites , Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah ;
14:29:013:0	and from the sons of Elizaphan , Shimri and Jeiel ; and from the sons of Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
14:29:014:0	and from the sons of Heman , Jehiel and Shimei ; and from the sons of Jeduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
14:29:015:0	They assembled their brothers , consecrated themselves , and went in to cleanse the house of the Lord , according to the commandment of the king by the words of the Lord .
14:29:016:0	So the priests went in to the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse it , and every unclean thing which they found in the temple of the Lord they brought out to the court of the house of the Lord . Then the Levites received it to carry out to the Kidron valley .
14:29:017:0	Now they began the consecration on the first day of the first month , and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the Lord . Then they consecrated the house of the Lord in eight days , and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month .
14:29:018:0	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said , “ We have cleansed the whole house of the Lord , the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils , and the table of showbread with all of its utensils .
14:29:003:1	Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship
14:29:019:0	Moreover , all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness , we have prepared and consecrated ; and behold , they are before the altar of the Lord . ”
14:29:020:0	Then King Hezekiah arose early and assembled the princes of the city and went up to the house of the Lord .
14:29:021:0	They brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom , the sanctuary , and Judah . And he ordered the priests , the sons of Aaron , to offer them on the altar of the Lord .
14:29:022:0	So they slaughtered the bulls , and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar . They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar ; they slaughtered the lambs also and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
14:29:023:0	Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly , and they laid their hands on them .
14:29:024:0	The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for all Israel , for the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel .
14:29:025:0	He then stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals , with harps and with lyres , according to the command of David and of Gad the king’s seer , and of Nathan the prophet ; for the command was from the Lord through His prophets .
14:29:026:0	The Levites stood with the musical instruments of David , and the priests with the trumpets .
14:29:027:0	Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar . When the burnt offering began , the song to the Lord also began with the trumpets , accompanied by the instruments of David , king of Israel .
14:29:028:0	While the whole assembly worshiped , the singers also sang and the trumpets sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
14:29:029:0	Now at the completion of the burnt offerings , the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped .
14:29:030:0	Moreover , King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the Lord with the words of David and Asaph the seer . So they sang praises with joy , and bowed down and worshiped .
14:29:031:0	Then Hezekiah said , “ Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord , come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the Lord . ” And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings , and all those who were willing brought burnt offerings .
14:29:032:0	The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was 70 bulls , 100 rams , and 200 lambs ; all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord .
14:29:033:0	The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3 , 000 sheep .
14:29:034:0	But the priests were too few , so that they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings ; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was completed and until the other priests had consecrated themselves . For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests .
14:29:035:0	There were also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and with the libations for the burnt offerings . Thus the service of the house of the Lord was established again .
14:29:036:0	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people , because the thing came about suddenly .
