14:15:001:1	The Prophet Azariah Warns Asa
14:15:001:0	Now the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded ,
14:15:002:0	and he went out to meet Asa and said to him , “ Listen to me , Asa , and all Judah and Benjamin : the Lord is with you when you are with Him . And if you seek Him , He will let you find Him ; but if you forsake Him , He will forsake you .
14:15:003:0	For many days Israel was without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law .
14:15:004:0	But in their distress they turned to the Lord God of Israel , and they sought Him , and He let them find Him .
14:15:005:0	In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in , for many disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands .
14:15:006:0	Nation was crushed by nation , and city by city , for God troubled them with every kind of distress .
14:15:002:1	Asa’s Reforms
14:15:007:0	But you , be strong and do not lose courage , for there is reward for your work . ”
14:15:008:0	Now when Asa heard these words and the prophecy which Azariah the son of Oded the prophet spoke , he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim . He then restored the altar of the Lord which was in front of the porch of the Lord .
14:15:009:0	He gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim , Manasseh and Simeon who resided with them , for many defected to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
14:15:010:0	So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign .
14:15:011:0	They sacrificed to the Lord that day 700 oxen and 7 , 000 sheep from the spoil they had brought .
14:15:012:0	They entered into the covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and soul ;
14:15:013:0	and whoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , man or woman .
14:15:014:0	Moreover , they made an oath to the Lord with a loud voice , with shouting , with trumpets and with horns .
14:15:015:0	All Judah rejoiced concerning the oath , for they had sworn with their whole heart and had sought Him earnestly , and He let them find Him . So the Lord gave them rest on every side .
14:15:016:0	He also removed Maacah , the mother of King Asa , from the position of queen mother , because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah , and Asa cut down her horrid image , crushed it and burned it at the brook Kidron .
14:15:017:0	But the high places were not removed from Israel ; nevertheless Asa’s heart was blameless all his days .
14:15:018:0	He brought into the house of God the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things : silver and gold and utensils .
14:15:019:0	And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign .
