14:3:002:0	He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign .
14:3:003:0	Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for building the house of God . The length in cubits , according to the old standard was sixty cubits , and the width twenty cubits .
14:3:004:0	The porch which was in front of the house was as long as the width of the house , twenty cubits , and the height 120 ; and inside he overlaid it with pure gold .
14:3:005:0	He overlaid the main room with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold , and ornamented it with palm trees and chains .

14:3:007:0	He also overlaid the house with goldâ€”the beams , the thresholds and its walls and its doors ; and he carved cherubim on the walls .
14:3:008:0	Now he made the room of the holy of holies : its length across the width of the house was twenty cubits , and its width was twenty cubits ; and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to 600 talents .
14:3:009:0	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold .
14:3:010:0	Then he made two sculptured cherubim in the room of the holy of holies and overlaid them with gold .
14:3:011:0	The wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits ; the wing of one , of five cubits , touched the wall of the house , and its other wing , of five cubits , touched the wing of the other cherub .
14:3:012:0	The wing of the other cherub , of five cubits , touched the wall of the house ; and its other wing of five cubits was attached to the wing of the first cherub .
14:3:013:0	The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits , and they stood on their feet facing the main room .
14:3:014:0	He made the veil of violet , purple , crimson and fine linen , and he worked cherubim on it .
14:3:015:0	He also made two pillars for the front of the house , thirty-five cubits high , and the capital on the top of each was five cubits .
14:3:016:0	He made chains in the inner sanctuary and placed them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred pomegranates and placed them on the chains .
14:3:017:0	He erected the pillars in front of the temple , one on the right and the other on the left , and named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz .
