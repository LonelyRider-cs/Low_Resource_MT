14:9:001:1	Visit of the Queen of Sheba
14:9:001:0	Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon , she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions . She had a very large retinue , with camels carrying spices and a large amount of gold and precious stones ; and when she came to Solomon , she spoke with him about all that was on her heart .
14:9:002:0	Solomon answered all her questions ; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her .
14:9:003:0	When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon , the house which he had built ,
14:9:004:0	the food at his table , the seating of his servants , the attendance of his ministers and their attire , his cupbearers and their attire , and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the Lord , she was breathless .
14:9:005:0	Then she said to the king , “ It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom .
14:9:006:0	Nevertheless I did not believe their reports until I came and my eyes had seen it . And behold , the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me . You surpass the report that I heard .
14:9:007:0	How blessed are your men , how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom .
14:9:008:0	Blessed be the Lord your God who delighted in you , setting you on His throne as king for the Lord your God ; because your God loved Israel establishing them forever , therefore He made you king over them , to do justice and righteousness . ”
14:9:009:0	Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great amount of spices and precious stones ; there had never been spice like that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
14:9:010:0	The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir , also brought algum trees and precious stones .
14:9:011:0	From the algum trees the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the king’s palace , and lyres and harps for the singers ; and none like that was seen before in the land of Judah .
14:9:002:1	Solomon’s Wealth and Power
14:9:012:0	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested besides a return for what she had brought to the king . Then she turned and went to her own land with her servants .
14:9:013:0	Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold ,
14:9:014:0	besides that which the traders and merchants brought ; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
14:9:015:0	King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold , using 600 shekels of beaten gold on each large shield .
14:9:016:0	He made 300 shields of beaten gold , using three hundred shekels of gold on each shield , and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
14:9:017:0	Moreover , the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold .
14:9:018:0	There were six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne , and arms on each side of the seat , and two lions standing beside the arms .
14:9:019:0	Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other ; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom .
14:9:020:0	All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold ; silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon .
14:9:021:0	For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram ; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver , ivory and apes and peacocks .
14:9:022:0	So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
14:9:023:0	And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart .
14:9:024:0	They brought every man his gift , articles of silver and gold , garments , weapons , spices , horses and mules , so much year by year .
14:9:025:0	Now Solomon had 4 , 000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12 , 000 horsemen , and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem .
14:9:026:0	He was the ruler over all the kings from the Euphrates River even to the land of the Philistines , and as far as the border of Egypt .
14:9:027:0	The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem , and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland .
14:9:028:0	And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries .
14:9:029:0	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon , from first to last , are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
14:9:003:1	Death of Solomon
14:9:030:0	Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem over all Israel .
14:9:031:0	And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David ; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place .
