14:21:001:1	Jehoram Succeeds Jehoshaphat in Judah
14:21:001:0	Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David , and Jehoram his son became king in his place .
14:21:002:0	He had brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah , Jehiel , Zechariah , Azaryahu , Michael and Shephatiah . All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
14:21:003:0	Their father gave them many gifts of silver , gold and precious things , with fortified cities in Judah , but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn .
14:21:004:0	Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure , he killed all his brothers with the sword , and some of the rulers of Israel also .
14:21:005:0	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
14:21:006:0	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel , just as the house of Ahab did ( for Ahab’s daughter was his wife ) , and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
14:21:002:1	Revolt against Judah
14:21:007:0	Yet the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David because of the covenant which He had made with David , and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and his sons forever .
14:21:008:0	In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah and set up a king over themselves .
14:21:009:0	Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots with him . And he arose by night and struck down the Edomites who were surrounding him and the commanders of the chariots .
14:21:010:0	So Edom revolted against Judah to this day . Then Libnah revolted at the same time against his rule , because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers .
14:21:011:0	Moreover , he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray .
14:21:012:0	Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying , “ Thus says the Lord God of your father David , ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and the ways of Asa king of Judah ,
14:21:013:0	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot as the house of Ahab played the harlot , and you have also killed your brothers , your own family , who were better than you ,
14:21:014:0	behold , the Lord is going to strike your people , your sons , your wives and all your possessions with a great calamity ;
14:21:015:0	and you will suffer severe sickness , a disease of your bowels , until your bowels come out because of the sickness , day by day . ’ ”
14:21:016:0	Then the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who bordered the Ethiopians ;
14:21:017:0	and they came against Judah and invaded it , and carried away all the possessions found in the king’s house together with his sons and his wives , so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
14:21:018:0	So after all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable sickness .
14:21:019:0	Now it came about in the course of time , at the end of two years , that his bowels came out because of his sickness and he died in great pain . And his people made no fire for him like the fire for his fathers .
14:21:020:0	He was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years ; and he departed with no one’s regret , and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
