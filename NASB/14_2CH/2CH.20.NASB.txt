14:20:001:1	Judah Invaded
14:20:001:0	Now it came about after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon , together with some of the Meunites , came to make war against Jehoshaphat .
14:20:002:0	Then some came and reported to Jehoshaphat , saying , “ A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea , out of Aram and behold , they are in Hazazon-tamar ( that is Engedi ) . ”
14:20:003:0	Jehoshaphat was afraid and turned his attention to seek the Lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
14:20:002:1	Jehoshaphat’s Prayer
14:20:004:0	So Judah gathered together to seek help from the Lord ; they even came from all the cities of Judah to seek the Lord .
14:20:005:0	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the Lord before the new court ,
14:20:006:0	and he said , “ O Lord , the God of our fathers , are You not God in the heavens ? And are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations ? Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against You .
14:20:007:0	Did You not , O our God , drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever ?
14:20:008:0	They have lived in it , and have built You a sanctuary there for Your name , saying ,
14:20:009:0	‘Should evil come upon us , the sword , or judgment , or pestilence , or famine , we will stand before this house and before You ( for Your name is in this house ) and cry to You in our distress , and You will hear and deliver us . ’
14:20:010:0	Now behold , the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir , whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt ( they turned aside from them and did not destroy them ) ,
14:20:011:0	see how they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out from Your possession which You have given us as an inheritance .
14:20:012:0	O our God , will You not judge them ? For we are powerless before this great multitude who are coming against us ; nor do we know what to do , but our eyes are on You . ”
14:20:003:1	Jahaziel Answers the Prayer
14:20:013:0	All Judah was standing before the Lord , with their infants , their wives and their children .
14:20:014:0	Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , the Levite of the sons of Asaph ;
14:20:015:0	and he said , “ Listen , all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat : thus says the Lord to you , ‘Do not fear or be dismayed because of this great multitude , for the battle is not yours but God’s .
14:20:016:0	Tomorrow go down against them . Behold , they will come up by the ascent of Ziz , and you will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel .
14:20:017:0	You need not fight in this battle ; station yourselves , stand and see the salvation of the Lord on your behalf , O Judah and Jerusalem . ’ Do not fear or be dismayed ; tomorrow go out to face them , for the Lord is with you . ”
14:20:018:0	Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground , and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Lord , worshiping the Lord .
14:20:004:1	Enemies Destroy Themselves
14:20:019:0	The Levites , from the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel , with a very loud voice .
14:20:020:0	They rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa ; and when they went out , Jehoshaphat stood and said , “ Listen to me , O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem , put your trust in the Lord your God and you will be established . Put your trust in His prophets and succeed . ”
14:20:021:0	When he had consulted with the people , he appointed those who sang to the Lord and those who praised Him in holy attire , as they went out before the army and said , “ Give thanks to the Lord , for His lovingkindness is everlasting . ”
14:20:022:0	When they began singing and praising , the Lord set ambushes against the sons of Ammon , Moab and Mount Seir , who had come against Judah ; so they were routed .
14:20:023:0	For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir destroying them completely ; and when they had finished with the inhabitants of Seir , they helped to destroy one another .
14:20:024:0	When Judah came to the lookout of the wilderness , they looked toward the multitude , and behold , they were corpses lying on the ground , and no one had escaped .
14:20:005:1	Triumphant Return to Jerusalem
14:20:025:0	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil , they found much among them , including goods , garments and valuable things which they took for themselves , more than they could carry . And they were three days taking the spoil because there was so much .
14:20:026:0	Then on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Beracah , for there they blessed the Lord . Therefore they have named that place “ The Valley of Beracah ” until today .
14:20:027:0	Every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned with Jehoshaphat at their head , returning to Jerusalem with joy , for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
14:20:028:0	They came to Jerusalem with harps , lyres and trumpets to the house of the Lord .
14:20:029:0	And the dread of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel .
14:20:030:0	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace , for his God gave him rest on all sides .
14:20:031:0	Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah . He was thirty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years . And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
14:20:032:0	He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not depart from it , doing right in the sight of the Lord .
14:20:033:0	The high places , however , were not removed ; the people had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their fathers .
14:20:006:1	Alliance Displeases God
14:20:034:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first to last , behold , they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani , which is recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel .
14:20:035:0	After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel . He acted wickedly in so doing .
14:20:036:0	So he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish , and they made the ships in Ezion-geber .
14:20:037:0	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying , “ Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah , the Lord has destroyed your works . ” So the ships were broken and could not go to Tarshish .
