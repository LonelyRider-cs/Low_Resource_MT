14:6:001:1	Solomon’s Dedication
14:6:001:0	Then Solomon said , “ The Lord has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud .
14:6:002:0	I have built You a lofty house , And a place for Your dwelling forever . ”
14:6:003:0	Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel , while all the assembly of Israel was standing .
14:6:004:0	He said , “ Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hands , saying ,
14:6:005:0	‘Since the day that I brought My people from the land of Egypt , I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there , nor did I choose any man for a leader over My people Israel ;
14:6:006:0	but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there , and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel . ’
14:6:007:0	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
14:6:008:0	But the Lord said to my father David , ‘Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name , you did well that it was in your heart .
14:6:009:0	Nevertheless you shall not build the house , but your son who will be born to you , he shall build the house for My name . ’
14:6:010:0	Now the Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke ; for I have risen in the place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
14:6:002:1	Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication
14:6:011:0	There I have set the ark in which is the covenant of the Lord , which He made with the sons of Israel . ”
14:6:012:0	Then he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands .
14:6:013:0	Now Solomon had made a bronze platform , five cubits long , five cubits wide and three cubits high , and had set it in the midst of the court ; and he stood on it , knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven .
14:6:014:0	He said , “ O Lord , the God of Israel , there is no god like You in heaven or on earth , keeping covenant and showing lovingkindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart ;
14:6:015:0	who has kept with Your servant David , my father , that which You have promised him ; indeed You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand , as it is this day .
14:6:016:0	Now therefore , O Lord , the God of Israel , keep with Your servant David , my father , that which You have promised him , saying , ‘You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel , if only your sons take heed to their way , to walk in My law as you have walked before Me . ’
14:6:017:0	Now therefore , O Lord , the God of Israel , let Your word be confirmed which You have spoken to Your servant David .
14:6:018:0	“ But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth ? Behold , heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You ; how much less this house which I have built .
14:6:019:0	Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before You ;
14:6:020:0	that Your eye may be open toward this house day and night , toward the place of which You have said that You would put Your name there , to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place .
14:6:021:0	Listen to the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place ; hear from Your dwelling place , from heaven ; hear and forgive .
14:6:022:0	“ If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath , and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this house ,
14:6:023:0	then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants , punishing the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness .
14:6:024:0	“ If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You , and they return to You and confess Your name , and pray and make supplication before You in this house ,
14:6:025:0	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel , and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and to their fathers .
14:6:026:0	“ When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You , and they pray toward this place and confess Your name , and turn from their sin when You afflict them ;
14:6:027:0	then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel , indeed , teach them the good way in which they should walk . And send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people for an inheritance .
14:6:028:0	“ If there is famine in the land , if there is pestilence , if there is blight or mildew , if there is locust or grasshopper , if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities , whatever plague or whatever sickness there is ,
14:6:029:0	whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Your people Israel , each knowing his own affliction and his own pain , and spreading his hands toward this house ,
14:6:030:0	then hear from heaven Your dwelling place , and forgive , and render to each according to all his ways , whose heart You know for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men ,
14:6:031:0	that they may fear You , to walk in Your ways as long as they live in the land which You have given to our fathers .
14:6:032:0	“ Also concerning the foreigner who is not from Your people Israel , when he comes from a far country for Your great name’s sake and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm , when they come and pray toward this house ,
14:6:033:0	then hear from heaven , from Your dwelling place , and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You , in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name , and fear You as do Your people Israel , and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name .
14:6:034:0	“ When Your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way You shall send them , and they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name ,
14:6:035:0	then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
14:6:036:0	“ When they sin against You ( for there is no man who does not sin ) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy , so that they take them away captive to a land far off or near ,
14:6:037:0	if they take thought in the land where they are taken captive , and repent and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity , saying , ‘We have sinned , we have committed iniquity and have acted wickedly’ ;
14:6:038:0	if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , where they have been taken captive , and pray toward their land which You have given to their fathers and the city which You have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for Your name ,
14:6:039:0	then hear from heaven , from Your dwelling place , their prayer and supplications , and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You .
14:6:040:0	“ Now , O my God , I pray , let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place .
14:6:041:0	“ Now therefore arise , O Lord God , to Your resting place , You and the ark of Your might ; let Your priests , O Lord God , be clothed with salvation and let Your godly ones rejoice in what is good .
14:6:042:0	“ O Lord God , do not turn away the face of Your anointed ; remember Your lovingkindness to Your servant David . ”
