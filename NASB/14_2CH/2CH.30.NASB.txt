14:30:001:1	All Israel Invited to the Passover
14:30:001:0	Now Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to the Lord God of Israel .
14:30:002:0	For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month ,
14:30:003:0	since they could not celebrate it at that time , because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers , nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem .
14:30:004:0	Thus the thing was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly .
14:30:005:0	So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba even to Dan , that they should come to celebrate the Passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem . For they had not celebrated it in great numbers as it was prescribed .
14:30:006:0	The couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes , even according to the command of the king , saying , “ O sons of Israel , return to the Lord God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , that He may return to those of you who escaped and are left from the hand of the kings of Assyria .
14:30:007:0	Do not be like your fathers and your brothers , who were unfaithful to the Lord God of their fathers , so that He made them a horror , as you see .
14:30:008:0	Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers , but yield to the Lord and enter His sanctuary which He has consecrated forever , and serve the Lord your God , that His burning anger may turn away from you .
14:30:009:0	For if you return to the Lord , your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land . For the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate , and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him . ”
14:30:010:0	So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , and as far as Zebulun , but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them .
14:30:011:0	Nevertheless some men of Asher , Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem .
14:30:002:1	Passover Reinstituted
14:30:012:0	The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the Lord .
14:30:013:0	Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month , a very large assembly .
14:30:014:0	They arose and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem ; they also removed all the incense altars and cast them into the brook Kidron .
14:30:015:0	Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month . And the priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves , and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the Lord .
14:30:016:0	They stood at their stations after their custom , according to the law of Moses the man of God ; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites .
14:30:017:0	For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves ; therefore , the Levites were over the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was unclean , in order to consecrate them to the Lord .
14:30:018:0	For a multitude of the people , even many from Ephraim and Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun , had not purified themselves , yet they ate the Passover otherwise than prescribed . For Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , “ May the good Lord pardon
14:30:019:0	everyone who prepares his heart to seek God , the Lord God of his fathers , though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary . ”
14:30:020:0	So the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people .
14:30:021:0	The sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy , and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day after day with loud instruments to the Lord .
14:30:022:0	Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight in the things of the Lord . So they ate for the appointed seven days , sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the Lord God of their fathers .
14:30:023:0	Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the feast another seven days , so they celebrated the seven days with joy .
14:30:024:0	For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the assembly 1 , 000 bulls and 7 , 000 sheep , and the princes had contributed to the assembly 1 , 000 bulls and 10 , 000 sheep ; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves .
14:30:025:0	All the assembly of Judah rejoiced , with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel , both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah .
14:30:026:0	So there was great joy in Jerusalem , because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel .
14:30:027:0	Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people ; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place , to heaven .
