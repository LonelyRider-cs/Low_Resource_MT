14:31:001:1	Idols Are Destroyed
14:31:001:0	Now when all this was finished , all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah , broke the pillars in pieces , cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin , as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh , until they had destroyed them all . Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities , each to his possession .
14:31:002:1	Reforms Continued
14:31:002:0	And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions , each according to his service , both the priests and the Levites , for burnt offerings and for peace offerings , to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the Lord .
14:31:003:0	He also appointed the king’s portion of his goods for the burnt offerings , namely , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the fixed festivals , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
14:31:004:0	Also he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites , that they might devote themselves to the law of the Lord .
14:31:005:0	As soon as the order spread , the sons of Israel provided in abundance the first fruits of grain , new wine , oil , honey and of all the produce of the field ; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all .
14:31:006:0	The sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the Lord their God , and placed them in heaps .
14:31:007:0	In the third month they began to make the heaps , and finished them by the seventh month .
14:31:008:0	When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps , they blessed the Lord and His people Israel .
14:31:009:0	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
14:31:010:0	Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok said to him , “ Since the contributions began to be brought into the house of the Lord , we have had enough to eat with plenty left over , for the Lord has blessed His people , and this great quantity is left over . ”
14:31:011:0	Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the Lord , and they prepared them .
14:31:012:0	They faithfully brought in the contributions and the tithes and the consecrated things ; and Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them and his brother Shimei was second .
14:31:013:0	Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismachiah , Mahath and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and Shimei his brother by the appointment of King Hezekiah , and Azariah was the chief officer of the house of God .
14:31:014:0	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the keeper of the eastern gate , was over the freewill offerings of God , to apportion the contributions for the Lord and the most holy things .
14:31:015:0	Under his authority were Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests , to distribute faithfully their portions to their brothers by divisions , whether great or small ,
14:31:016:0	without regard to their genealogical enrollment , to the males from thirty years old and upward—everyone who entered the house of the Lord for his daily obligations—for their work in their duties according to their divisions ;
14:31:017:0	as well as the priests who were enrolled genealogically according to their fathers’ households , and the Levites from twenty years old and upwards , by their duties and their divisions .
14:31:018:0	The genealogical enrollment included all their little children , their wives , their sons and their daughters , for the whole assembly , for they consecrated themselves faithfully in holiness .
14:31:019:0	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the pasture lands of their cities , or in each and every city , there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone genealogically enrolled among the Levites .
14:31:020:0	Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah ; and he did what was good , right and true before the Lord his God .
14:31:021:0	Every work which he began in the service of the house of God in law and in commandment , seeking his God , he did with all his heart and prospered .
