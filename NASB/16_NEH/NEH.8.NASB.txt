16:8:001:1	Ezra Reads the Law
16:8:001:0	And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate , and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel .
16:8:002:0	Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men , women and all who could listen with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
16:8:003:0	He read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday , in the presence of men and women , those who could understand ; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law .
16:8:004:0	Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose . And beside him stood Mattithiah , Shema , Anaiah , Uriah , Hilkiah , and Maaseiah on his right hand ; and Pedaiah , Mishael , Malchijah , Hashum , Hashbaddanah , Zechariah and Meshullam on his left hand .
16:8:005:0	Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people ; and when he opened it , all the people stood up .
16:8:006:0	Then Ezra blessed the Lord the great God . And all the people answered , “ Amen , Amen ! ” while lifting up their hands ; then they bowed low and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground .
16:8:007:0	Also Jeshua , Bani , Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , the Levites , explained the law to the people while the people remained in their place .
16:8:002:1	“ This Day Is Holy ”
16:8:008:0	They read from the book , from the law of God , translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading .
16:8:009:0	Then Nehemiah , who was the governor , and Ezra the priest and scribe , and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people , “ This day is holy to the Lord your God ; do not mourn or weep . ” For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law .
16:8:010:0	Then he said to them , “ Go , eat of the fat , drink of the sweet , and send portions to him who has nothing prepared ; for this day is holy to our Lord . Do not be grieved , for the joy of the Lord is your strength . ”
16:8:011:0	So the Levites calmed all the people , saying , “ Be still , for the day is holy ; do not be grieved . ”
16:8:003:1	Feast of Booths Restored
16:8:012:0	All the people went away to eat , to drink , to send portions and to celebrate a great festival , because they understood the words which had been made known to them .
16:8:013:0	Then on the second day the heads of fathers’ households of all the people , the priests and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe that they might gain insight into the words of the law .
16:8:014:0	They found written in the law how the Lord had commanded through Moses that the sons of Israel should live in booths during the feast of the seventh month .
16:8:015:0	So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem , saying , “ Go out to the hills , and bring olive branches and wild olive branches , myrtle branches , palm branches and branches of other leafy trees , to make booths , as it is written . ”
16:8:016:0	So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves , each on his roof , and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God , and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim .
16:8:017:0	The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them . The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day . And there was great rejoicing .
16:8:018:0	He read from the book of the law of God daily , from the first day to the last day . And they celebrated the feast seven days , and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance .
