16:2:001:1	Nehemiah’s Prayer Answered
16:2:001:0	And it came about in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes , that wine was before him , and I took up the wine and gave it to the king . Now I had not been sad in his presence .
16:2:002:0	So the king said to me , “ Why is your face sad though you are not sick ? This is nothing but sadness of heart . ” Then I was very much afraid .
16:2:003:0	I said to the king , “ Let the king live forever . Why should my face not be sad when the city , the place of my fathers’ tombs , lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire ? ”
16:2:004:0	Then the king said to me , “ What would you request ? ” So I prayed to the God of heaven .
16:2:005:0	I said to the king , “ If it please the king , and if your servant has found favor before you , send me to Judah , to the city of my fathers’ tombs , that I may rebuild it . ”
16:2:006:0	Then the king said to me , the queen sitting beside him , “ How long will your journey be , and when will you return ? ” So it pleased the king to send me , and I gave him a definite time .
16:2:007:0	And I said to the king , “ If it please the king , let letters be given me for the governors of the provinces beyond the River , that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah ,
16:2:008:0	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest , that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple , for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go . ” And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me .
16:2:009:0	Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters . Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen .
16:2:002:1	Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem’s Walls
16:2:010:0	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it , it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel .
16:2:011:0	So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days .
16:2:012:0	And I arose in the night , I and a few men with me . I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding .
16:2:013:0	So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate , inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire .
16:2:014:0	Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool , but there was no place for my mount to pass .
16:2:015:0	So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall . Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned .
16:2:016:0	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done ; nor had I as yet told the Jews , the priests , the nobles , the officials or the rest who did the work .
16:2:017:0	Then I said to them , “ You see the bad situation we are in , that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire . Come , let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach . ”
16:2:018:0	I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me . Then they said , “ Let us arise and build . ” So they put their hands to the good work .
16:2:019:0	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official , and Geshem the Arab heard it , they mocked us and despised us and said , “ What is this thing you are doing ? Are you rebelling against the king ? ”
16:2:020:0	So I answered them and said to them , “ The God of heaven will give us success ; therefore we His servants will arise and build , but you have no portion , right or memorial in Jerusalem . ”
