16:7:001:0	Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors , and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,

16:7:003:0	Then I said to them , “ Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot , and while they are standing guard , let them shut and bolt the doors . Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem , each at his post , and each in front of his own house . ”
