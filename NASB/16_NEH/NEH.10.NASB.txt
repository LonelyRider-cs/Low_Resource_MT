16:10:027:0	Malluch , Harim , Baanah .
16:10:028:0	Now the rest of the people , the priests , the Levites , the gatekeepers , the singers , the temple servants and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God , their wives , their sons and their daughters , all those who had knowledge and understanding ,
16:10:029:0	are joining with their kinsmen , their nobles , and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God’s law , which was given through Moses , God’s servant , and to keep and to observe all the commandments of God our Lord , and His ordinances and His statutes ;
16:10:030:0	and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons .
16:10:031:0	As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell , we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day ; and we will forego the crops the seventh year and the exaction of every debt .
16:10:032:0	We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God :
16:10:033:0	for the showbread , for the continual grain offering , for the continual burnt offering , the sabbaths , the new moon , for the appointed times , for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel , and all the work of the house of our God .
16:10:034:0	Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood among the priests , the Levites and the people so that they might bring it to the house of our God , according to our fathers’ households , at fixed times annually , to burn on the altar of the Lord our God , as it is written in the law ;
16:10:035:0	and that they might bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the Lord annually ,
16:10:036:0	and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle , and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the law , for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God .
16:10:037:0	We will also bring the first of our dough , our contributions , the fruit of every tree , the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God , and the tithe of our ground to the Levites , for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns .
16:10:038:0	The priest , the son of Aaron , shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes , and the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God , to the chambers of the storehouse .
16:10:039:0	For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain , the new wine and the oil to the chambers ; there are the utensils of the sanctuary , the priests who are ministering , the gatekeepers and the singers . Thus we will not neglect the house of our God .
