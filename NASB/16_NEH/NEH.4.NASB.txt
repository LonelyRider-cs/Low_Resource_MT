16:4:001:1	Work Is Ridiculed
16:4:001:0	Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall , he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews .
16:4:002:0	He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said , “ What are these feeble Jews doing ? Are they going to restore it for themselves ? Can they offer sacrifices ? Can they finish in a day ? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones ? ”
16:4:003:0	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said , “ Even what they are building—if a fox should jump on it , he would break their stone wall down ! ”
16:4:004:0	Hear , O our God , how we are despised ! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity .
16:4:005:0	Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You , for they have demoralized the builders .
16:4:006:0	So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its height , for the people had a mind to work .
16:4:007:0	Now when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on , and that the breaches began to be closed , they were very angry .
16:4:002:1	Discouragement Overcome
16:4:008:0	All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it .
16:4:009:0	But we prayed to our God , and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night .
16:4:010:0	Thus in Judah it was said , “ The strength of the burden bearers is failing , Yet there is much rubbish ; And we ourselves are unableTo rebuild the wall . ”
16:4:011:0	Our enemies said , “ They will not know or see until we come among them , kill them and put a stop to the work . ”
16:4:012:0	When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times , “ They will come up against us from every place where you may turn , ”
16:4:013:0	then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , the exposed places , and I stationed the people in families with their swords , spears and bows .
16:4:014:0	When I saw their fear , I rose and spoke to the nobles , the officials and the rest of the people : “ Do not be afraid of them ; remember the Lord who is great and awesome , and fight for your brothers , your sons , your daughters , your wives and your houses . ”
16:4:015:0	When our enemies heard that it was known to us , and that God had frustrated their plan , then all of us returned to the wall , each one to his work .
16:4:016:0	From that day on , half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears , the shields , the bows and the breastplates ; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah .
16:4:017:0	Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon .
16:4:018:0	As for the builders , each wore his sword girded at his side as he built , while the trumpeter stood near me .
16:4:019:0	I said to the nobles , the officials and the rest of the people , “ The work is great and extensive , and we are separated on the wall far from one another .
16:4:020:0	At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet , rally to us there . Our God will fight for us . ”
16:4:021:0	So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared .
16:4:022:0	At that time I also said to the people , “ Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day . ”
16:4:023:0	So neither I , my brothers , my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us removed our clothes , each took his weapon even to the water .
