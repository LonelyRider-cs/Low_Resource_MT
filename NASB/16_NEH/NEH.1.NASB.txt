16:1:001:1	Nehemiah’s Grief for the Exiles
16:1:001:0	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah . Now it happened in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , while I was in Susa the capitol ,
16:1:002:0	that Hanani , one of my brothers , and some men from Judah came ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity , and about Jerusalem .
16:1:003:0	They said to me , “ The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach , and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire . ”
16:1:004:0	When I heard these words , I sat down and wept and mourned for days ; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven .
16:1:005:0	I said , “ I beseech You , O Lord God of heaven , the great and awesome God , who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments ,
16:1:006:0	let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now , day and night , on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants , confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You ; I and my father’s house have sinned .
16:1:007:0	We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses .
16:1:008:0	Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses , saying , ‘If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples ;
16:1:009:0	but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them , though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens , I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell . ’
16:1:010:0	They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand .
16:1:011:0	O Lord , I beseech You , may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name , and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man . ” Now I was the cupbearer to the king .
