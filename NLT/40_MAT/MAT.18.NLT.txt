40:18:001:1	The Greatest in the Kingdom
40:18:001:0	About that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven ? ”
40:18:002:0	Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them .
40:18:003:0	Then he said , “ I tell you the truth , unless you turn from your sins and become like little children , you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven .
40:18:004:0	So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .
40:18:005:0	“ And anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf is welcoming me .
40:18:006:0	But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin , it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea .
40:18:007:0	“ What sorrow awaits the world , because it tempts people to sin . Temptations are inevitable , but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting .
40:18:008:0	So if your hand or foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It 's better to enter eternal life with only one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both of your hands and feet .
40:18:009:0	And if your eye causes you to sin , gouge it out and throw it away . It 's better to enter eternal life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
40:18:002:1	Parable of the Lost Sheep
40:18:010:0	“ Beware that you do n't look down on any of these little ones . For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly Father .
40:18:012:0	“ If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away , what will he do ? Wo n't he leave the ninety-nine others on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost ?
40:18:013:0	And if he finds it , I tell you the truth , he will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that did n't wander away !
40:18:003:1	Correcting Another Believer
40:18:014:0	In the same way , it is not my heavenly Father 's will that even one of these little ones should perish .
40:18:015:0	“ If another believer sins against you , go privately and point out the offense . If the other person listens and confesses it , you have won that person back .
40:18:016:0	But if you are unsuccessful , take one or two others with you and go back again , so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses .
40:18:017:0	If the person still refuses to listen , take your case to the church . Then if he or she wo n't accept the church 's decision , treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector .
40:18:018:0	“ I tell you the truth , whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven , and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven .
40:18:019:0	“ I also tell you this : If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask , my Father in heaven will do it for you .
40:18:004:1	Parable of the Unforgiving Debtor
40:18:020:0	For where two or three gather together as my followers , I am there among them . ”
40:18:021:0	Then Peter came to him and asked , “ Lord , how often should I forgive someone who sins against me ? Seven times ? ”
40:18:022:0	“ No , not seven times , ” Jesus replied , “ but seventy times seven !
40:18:023:0	“ Therefore , the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him .
40:18:024:0	In the process , one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars .
40:18:025:0	He could n't pay , so his master ordered that he be sold—along with his wife , his children , and everything he owned—to pay the debt .
40:18:026:0	“ But the man fell down before his master and begged him , ‘ Please , be patient with me , and I will pay it all . '
40:18:027:0	Then his master was filled with pity for him , and he released him and forgave his debt .
40:18:028:0	“ But when the man left the king , he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars . He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment .
40:18:029:0	“ His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time . ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay it , ' he pleaded .
40:18:030:0	But his creditor would n't wait . He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full .
40:18:031:0	“ When some of the other servants saw this , they were very upset . They went to the king and told him everything that had happened .
40:18:032:0	Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said , ‘ You evil servant ! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me .
40:18:033:0	Should n't you have mercy on your fellow servant , just as I had mercy on you ? '
40:18:034:0	Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt .
40:18:035:0	“ That 's what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters from your heart . ”
