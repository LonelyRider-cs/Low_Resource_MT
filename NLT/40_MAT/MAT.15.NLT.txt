40:15:001:1	Jesus Teaches about Inner Purity
40:15:001:0	Some Pharisees and teachers of religious law now arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus . They asked him ,
40:15:002:0	“ Why do your disciples disobey our age-old tradition ? For they ignore our tradition of ceremonial hand washing before they eat . ”
40:15:003:0	Jesus replied , “ And why do you , by your traditions , violate the direct commandments of God ?
40:15:004:0	For instance , God says , ‘ Honor your father and mother , ' and ‘ Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death . '
40:15:005:0	But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents , ‘ Sorry , I ca n't help you . For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you . '
40:15:006:0	In this way , you say they do n't need to honor their parents . And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition .
40:15:007:0	You hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you , for he wrote ,
40:15:008:0	‘ These people honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me .
40:15:009:0	Their worship is a farce , for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God . ' ”
40:15:010:0	Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear . “ Listen , ” he said , “ and try to understand .
40:15:011:0	It 's not what goes into your mouth that defiles you ; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth . ”
40:15:012:0	Then the disciples came to him and asked , “ Do you realize you offended the Pharisees by what you just said ? ”
40:15:013:0	Jesus replied , “ Every plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be uprooted ,
40:15:014:0	so ignore them . They are blind guides leading the blind , and if one blind person guides another , they will both fall into a ditch . ”
40:15:015:0	Then Peter said to Jesus , “ Explain to us the parable that says people are n't defiled by what they eat . ”
40:15:016:0	“ Do n't you understand yet ? ” Jesus asked .
40:15:017:0	“ Anything you eat passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer .
40:15:018:0	But the words you speak come from the heart — that 's what defiles you .
40:15:019:0	For from the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , all sexual immorality , theft , lying , and slander .
40:15:002:1	The Faith of a Gentile Woman
40:15:020:0	These are what defile you . Eating with unwashed hands will never defile you . ”
40:15:021:0	Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40:15:022:0	A Gentile woman who lived there came to him , pleading , “ Have mercy on me , O Lord , Son of David ! For my daughter is possessed by a demon that torments her severely . ”
40:15:023:0	But Jesus gave her no reply , not even a word . Then his disciples urged him to send her away . “ Tell her to go away , ” they said . “ She is bothering us with all her begging . ”
40:15:024:0	Then Jesus said to the woman , “ I was sent only to help God 's lost sheep — the people of Israel . ”
40:15:025:0	But she came and worshiped him , pleading again , “ Lord , help me ! ”
40:15:026:0	Jesus responded , “ It is n't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs . ”
40:15:027:0	She replied , “ That 's true , Lord , but even dogs are allowed to eat the scraps that fall beneath their masters ' table . ”
40:15:003:1	Jesus Heals Many People
40:15:028:0	“ Dear woman , ” Jesus said to her , “ your faith is great . Your request is granted. ” And her daughter was instantly healed .
40:15:029:0	Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee and climbed a hill and sat down .
40:15:030:0	A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame , blind , crippled , those who could n't speak , and many others . They laid them before Jesus , and he healed them all .
40:15:004:1	Jesus Feeds Four Thousand
40:15:031:0	The crowd was amazed ! Those who had n't been able to speak were talking , the crippled were made well , the lame were walking , and the blind could see again ! And they praised the God of Israel .
40:15:032:0	Then Jesus called his disciples and told them , “ I feel sorry for these people . They have been here with me for three days , and they have nothing left to eat . I do n't want to send them away hungry , or they will faint along the way . ”
40:15:033:0	The disciples replied , “ Where would we get enough food here in the wilderness for such a huge crowd ? ”
40:15:034:0	Jesus asked , “ How much bread do you have ? ” They replied , “ Seven loaves , and a few small fish . ”
40:15:035:0	So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground .
40:15:036:0	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , thanked God for them , and broke them into pieces . He gave them to the disciples , who distributed the food to the crowd .
40:15:037:0	They all ate as much as they wanted . Afterward , the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food .
40:15:038:0	There were 4,000 men who were fed that day , in addition to all the women and children .
40:15:039:0	Then Jesus sent the people home , and he got into a boat and crossed over to the region of Magadan .
