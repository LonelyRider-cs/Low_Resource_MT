40:4:001:1	The Temptation of Jesus
40:4:001:0	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil .
40:4:002:0	For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry .
40:4:003:0	During that time the devil came and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , tell these stones to become loaves of bread . ”
40:4:004:0	But Jesus told him , “ No ! The Scriptures say , ‘ People do not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes from the mouth of God . ' ”
40:4:005:0	Then the devil took him to the holy city , Jerusalem , to the highest point of the Temple ,
40:4:006:0	and said , “ If you are the Son of God , jump off ! For the Scriptures say , ‘ He will order his angels to protect you.And they will hold you up with their handsso you wo n't even hurt your foot on a stone . ' ”
40:4:007:0	Jesus responded , “ The Scriptures also say , ‘ You must not test the your God . ' ”
40:4:008:0	Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory .
40:4:009:0	“ I will give it all to you , ” he said , “ if you will kneel down and worship me . ”
40:4:010:0	“ Get out of here , Satan , ” Jesus told him . “ For the Scriptures say , ‘ You must worship the your Godand serve only him . ' ”
40:4:002:1	The Ministry of Jesus Begins
40:4:011:0	Then the devil went away , and angels came and took care of Jesus .
40:4:012:0	When Jesus heard that John had been arrested , he left Judea and returned to Galilee .
40:4:013:0	He went first to Nazareth , then left there and moved to Capernaum , beside the Sea of Galilee , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40:4:014:0	This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah :
40:4:015:0	“ In the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali , beside the sea , beyond the Jordan River , in Galilee where so many Gentiles live ,
40:4:016:0	the people who sat in darknesshave seen a great light.And for those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow , a light has shined . ”
40:4:003:1	The First Disciples
40:4:017:0	From then on Jesus began to preach , “ Repent of your sins and turn to God , for the Kingdom of Heaven is near . ”
40:4:018:0	One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers—Simon , also called Peter , and Andrew—throwing a net into the water , for they fished for a living .
40:4:019:0	Jesus called out to them , “ Come , follow me , and I will show you how to fish for people ! ”
40:4:020:0	And they left their nets at once and followed him .
40:4:021:0	A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers , James and John , sitting in a boat with their father , Zebedee , repairing their nets . And he called them to come , too .
40:4:004:1	Crowds Follow Jesus
40:4:022:0	They immediately followed him , leaving the boat and their father behind .
40:4:023:0	Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee , teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom . And he healed every kind of disease and illness .
40:4:024:0	News about him spread as far as Syria , and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick . And whatever their sickness or disease , or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed—he healed them all .
40:4:025:0	Large crowds followed him wherever he went—people from Galilee , the Ten Towns , Jerusalem , from all over Judea , and from east of the Jordan River .
