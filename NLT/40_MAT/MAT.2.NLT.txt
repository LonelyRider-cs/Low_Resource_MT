40:2:001:1	Visitors from the East
40:2:001:0	Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , during the reign of King Herod . About that time some wise men from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem , asking ,
40:2:002:0	“ Where is the newborn king of the Jews ? We saw his star as it rose , and we have come to worship him . ”
40:2:003:0	King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this , as was everyone in Jerusalem .
40:2:004:0	He called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers of religious law and asked , “ Where is the Messiah supposed to be born ? ”
40:2:005:0	“ In Bethlehem in Judea , ” they said , “ for this is what the prophet wrote :
40:2:006:0	‘ And you , O Bethlehem in the land of Judah , are not least among the ruling cities of Judah , for a ruler will come from youwho will be the shepherd for my people Israel . ' ”
40:2:007:0	Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men , and he learned from them the time when the star first appeared .
40:2:008:0	Then he told them , “ Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child . And when you find him , come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him , too ! ”
40:2:009:0	After this interview the wise men went their way . And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem . It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was .
40:2:010:0	When they saw the star , they were filled with joy !
40:2:011:0	They entered the house and saw the child with his mother , Mary , and they bowed down and worshiped him . Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40:2:002:1	The Escape to Egypt
40:2:012:0	When it was time to leave , they returned to their own country by another route , for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod .
40:2:013:0	After the wise men were gone , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream . “ Get up ! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother , ” the angel said . “ Stay there until I tell you to return , because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him . ”
40:2:014:0	That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary , his mother ,
40:2:015:0	and they stayed there until Herod 's death . This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet : “ I called my Son out of Egypt . ”
40:2:016:0	Herod was furious when he realized that the wise men had outwitted him . He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under , based on the wise men 's report of the star 's first appearance .
40:2:017:0	Herod 's brutal action fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah :
40:2:003:1	The Return to Nazareth
40:2:018:0	“ A cry was heard in Ramah—weeping and great mourning.Rachel weeps for her children , refusing to be comforted , for they are dead . ”
40:2:019:0	When Herod died , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt .
40:2:020:0	“ Get up ! ” the angel said . “ Take the child and his mother back to the land of Israel , because those who were trying to kill the child are dead . ”
40:2:021:0	So Joseph got up and returned to the land of Israel with Jesus and his mother .
40:2:022:0	But when he learned that the new ruler of Judea was Herod 's son Archelaus , he was afraid to go there . Then , after being warned in a dream , he left for the region of Galilee .
40:2:023:0	So the family went and lived in a town called Nazareth . This fulfilled what the prophets had said : “ He will be called a Nazarene . ”
