40:5:001:1	The Sermon on the Mount
40:5:001:0	One day as he saw the crowds gathering , Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down . His disciples gathered around him ,
40:5:002:1	The Beatitudes
40:5:002:0	and he began to teach them .
40:5:003:0	“ God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him , for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs .
40:5:004:0	God blesses those who mourn , for they will be comforted .
40:5:005:0	God blesses those who are humble , for they will inherit the whole earth .
40:5:006:0	God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice , for they will be satisfied .
40:5:007:0	God blesses those who are merciful , for they will be shown mercy .
40:5:008:0	God blesses those whose hearts are pure , for they will see God .
40:5:009:0	God blesses those who work for peace , for they will be called the children of God .
40:5:010:0	God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right , for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs .
40:5:011:0	“ God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers .
40:5:003:1	Teaching about Salt and Light
40:5:012:0	Be happy about it ! Be very glad ! For a great reward awaits you in heaven . And remember , the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way .
40:5:013:0	“ You are the salt of the earth . But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor ? Can you make it salty again ? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless .
40:5:014:0	“ You are the light of the world — like a city on a hilltop that can not be hidden .
40:5:015:0	No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket . Instead , a lamp is placed on a stand , where it gives light to everyone in the house .
40:5:004:1	Teaching about the Law
40:5:016:0	In the same way , let your good deeds shine out for all to see , so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father .
40:5:017:0	“ Do n't misunderstand why I have come . I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets . No , I came to accomplish their purpose .
40:5:018:0	I tell you the truth , until heaven and earth disappear , not even the smallest detail of God 's law will disappear until its purpose is achieved .
40:5:019:0	So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same , you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven . But anyone who obeys God 's laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven .
40:5:005:1	Teaching about Anger
40:5:020:0	“ But I warn you — unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees , you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven !
40:5:021:0	“ You have heard that our ancestors were told , ‘ You must not murder . If you commit murder , you are subject to judgment . '
40:5:022:0	But I say , if you are even angry with someone , you are subject to judgment ! If you call someone an idiot , you are in danger of being brought before the court . And if you curse someone , you are in danger of the fires of hell .
40:5:023:0	“ So if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you ,
40:5:024:0	leave your sacrifice there at the altar . Go and be reconciled to that person . Then come and offer your sacrifice to God .
40:5:025:0	“ When you are on the way to court with your adversary , settle your differences quickly . Otherwise , your accuser may hand you over to the judge , who will hand you over to an officer , and you will be thrown into prison .
40:5:006:1	Teaching about Adultery
40:5:026:0	And if that happens , you surely wo n't be free again until you have paid the last penny .
40:5:027:0	“ You have heard the commandment that says , ‘ You must not commit adultery . '
40:5:028:0	But I say , anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40:5:029:0	So if your eye — even your good eye — causes you to lust , gouge it out and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40:5:007:1	Teaching about Divorce
40:5:030:0	And if your hand — even your stronger hand — causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40:5:031:0	“ You have heard the law that says , ‘ A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce . '
40:5:008:1	Teaching about Vows
40:5:032:0	But I say that a man who divorces his wife , unless she has been unfaithful , causes her to commit adultery . And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery .
40:5:033:0	“ You have also heard that our ancestors were told , ‘ You must not break your vows ; you must carry out the vows you make to the . '
40:5:034:0	But I say , do not make any vows ! Do not say , ‘ By heaven ! ' because heaven is God 's throne .
40:5:035:0	And do not say , ‘ By the earth ! ' because the earth is his footstool . And do not say , ‘ By Jerusalem ! ' for Jerusalem is the city of the great King .
40:5:036:0	Do not even say , ‘ By my head ! ' for you ca n't turn one hair white or black .
40:5:009:1	Teaching about Revenge
40:5:037:0	Just say a simple , ‘ Yes , I will , ' or ‘ No , I wo n't . ' Anything beyond this is from the evil one .
40:5:038:0	“ You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury : ‘ An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . '
40:5:039:0	But I say , do not resist an evil person ! If someone slaps you on the right cheek , offer the other cheek also .
40:5:040:0	If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you , give your coat , too .
40:5:041:0	If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile , carry it two miles .
40:5:010:1	Teaching about Love for Enemies
40:5:042:0	Give to those who ask , and do n't turn away from those who want to borrow .
40:5:043:0	“ You have heard the law that says , ‘ Love your neighbor ' and hate your enemy .
40:5:044:0	But I say , love your enemies ! Pray for those who persecute you !
40:5:045:0	In that way , you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven . For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good , and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike .
40:5:046:0	If you love only those who love you , what reward is there for that ? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much .
40:5:047:0	If you are kind only to your friends , how are you different from anyone else ? Even pagans do that .
40:5:048:0	But you are to be perfect , even as your Father in heaven is perfect .
