40:6:001:1	Teaching about Giving to the Needy
40:6:001:0	“ Watch out ! Do n't do your good deeds publicly , to be admired by others , for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven .
40:6:002:0	When you give to someone in need , do n't do as the hypocrites do — blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity ! I tell you the truth , they have received all the reward they will ever get .
40:6:003:0	But when you give to someone in need , do n't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
40:6:002:1	Teaching about Prayer and Fasting
40:6:004:0	Give your gifts in private , and your Father , who sees everything , will reward you .
40:6:005:0	“ When you pray , do n't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them . I tell you the truth , that is all the reward they will ever get .
40:6:006:0	But when you pray , go away by yourself , shut the door behind you , and pray to your Father in private . Then your Father , who sees everything , will reward you .
40:6:007:0	“ When you pray , do n't babble on and on as the Gentiles do . They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again .
40:6:008:0	Do n't be like them , for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him !
40:6:009:0	Pray like this : Our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy .
40:6:010:0	May your Kingdom come soon.May your will be done on earth , as it is in heaven .
40:6:011:0	Give us today the food we need ,
40:6:012:0	and forgive us our sins , as we have forgiven those who sin against us .
40:6:013:0	And do n't let us yield to temptation , but rescue us from the evil one .
40:6:014:0	“ If you forgive those who sin against you , your heavenly Father will forgive you .
40:6:015:0	But if you refuse to forgive others , your Father will not forgive your sins .
40:6:016:0	“ And when you fast , do n't make it obvious , as the hypocrites do , for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting . I tell you the truth , that is the only reward they will ever get .
40:6:017:0	But when you fast , comb your hair and wash your face .
40:6:003:1	Teaching about Money and Possessions
40:6:018:0	Then no one will notice that you are fasting , except your Father , who knows what you do in private . And your Father , who sees everything , will reward you .
40:6:019:0	“ Do n't store up treasures here on earth , where moths eat them and rust destroys them , and where thieves break in and steal .
40:6:020:0	Store your treasures in heaven , where moths and rust can not destroy , and thieves do not break in and steal .
40:6:021:0	Wherever your treasure is , there the desires of your heart will also be .
40:6:022:0	“ Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is filled with light .
40:6:023:0	But when your eye is unhealthy , your whole body is filled with darkness . And if the light you think you have is actually darkness , how deep that darkness is !
40:6:024:0	“ No one can serve two masters . For you will hate one and love the other ; you will be devoted to one and despise the other . You can not serve God and be enslaved to money .
40:6:025:0	“ That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life — whether you have enough food and drink , or enough clothes to wear . Is n't life more than food , and your body more than clothing ?
40:6:026:0	Look at the birds . They do n't plant or harvest or store food in barns , for your heavenly Father feeds them . And are n't you far more valuable to him than they are ?
40:6:027:0	Can all your worries add a single moment to your life ?
40:6:028:0	“ And why worry about your clothing ? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow . They do n't work or make their clothing ,
40:6:029:0	yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are .
40:6:030:0	And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow , he will certainly care for you . Why do you have so little faith ?
40:6:031:0	“ So do n't worry about these things , saying , ‘ What will we eat ? What will we drink ? What will we wear ? '
40:6:032:0	These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers , but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs .
40:6:033:0	Seek the Kingdom of God above all else , and live righteously , and he will give you everything you need .
40:6:034:0	“ So do n't worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will bring its own worries . Today 's trouble is enough for today .
