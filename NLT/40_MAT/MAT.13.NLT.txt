40:13:001:1	Parable of the Farmer Scattering Seed
40:13:001:0	Later that same day Jesus left the house and sat beside the lake .
40:13:002:0	A large crowd soon gathered around him , so he got into a boat . Then he sat there and taught as the people stood on the shore .
40:13:003:0	He told many stories in the form of parables , such as this one : “ Listen ! A farmer went out to plant some seeds .
40:13:004:0	As he scattered them across his field , some seeds fell on a footpath , and the birds came and ate them .
40:13:005:0	Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock . The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow .
40:13:006:0	But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun , and since they did n't have deep roots , they died .
40:13:007:0	Other seeds fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants .
40:13:008:0	Still other seeds fell on fertile soil , and they produced a crop that was thirty , sixty , and even a hundred times as much as had been planted !
40:13:009:0	Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand . ”
40:13:010:0	His disciples came and asked him , “ Why do you use parables when you talk to the people ? ”
40:13:011:0	He replied , “ You are permitted to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven , but others are not .
40:13:012:0	To those who listen to my teaching , more understanding will be given , and they will have an abundance of knowledge . But for those who are not listening , even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them .
40:13:013:0	That is why I use these parables , For they look , but they do n't really see.They hear , but they do n't really listen or understand .
40:13:014:0	This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah that says , ‘ When you hear what I say , you will not understand.When you see what I do , you will not comprehend .
40:13:015:0	For the hearts of these people are hardened , and their ears can not hear , and they have closed their eyes—so their eyes can not see , and their ears can not hear , and their hearts can not understand , and they can not turn to meand let me heal them . '
40:13:016:0	“ But blessed are your eyes , because they see ; and your ears , because they hear .
40:13:017:0	I tell you the truth , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see , but they did n't see it . And they longed to hear what you hear , but they did n't hear it .
40:13:018:0	“ Now listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds :
40:13:019:0	The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message about the Kingdom and do n't understand it . Then the evil one comes and snatches away the seed that was planted in their hearts .
40:13:020:0	The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy .
40:13:021:0	But since they do n't have deep roots , they do n't last long . They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God 's word .
40:13:022:0	The seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear God 's word , but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth , so no fruit is produced .
40:13:002:1	Parable of the Wheat and Weeds
40:13:023:0	The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God 's word and produce a harvest of thirty , sixty , or even a hundred times as much as had been planted ! ”
40:13:024:0	Here is another story Jesus told : “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field .
40:13:025:0	But that night as the workers slept , his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat , then slipped away .
40:13:026:0	When the crop began to grow and produce grain , the weeds also grew .
40:13:027:0	“ The farmer 's workers went to him and said , ‘ Sir , the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds ! Where did they come from ? '
40:13:028:0	“ ‘ An enemy has done this ! ' the farmer exclaimed. “ ‘ Should we pull out the weeds ? ' they asked .
40:13:029:0	“ ‘ No , ' he replied , ‘ you 'll uproot the wheat if you do .
40:13:003:1	Parable of the Mustard Seed
40:13:030:0	Let both grow together until the harvest . Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds , tie them into bundles , and burn them , and to put the wheat in the barn . ' ”
40:13:031:0	Here is another illustration Jesus used : “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field .
40:13:004:1	Parable of the Yeast
40:13:032:0	It is the smallest of all seeds , but it becomes the largest of garden plants ; it grows into a tree , and birds come and make nests in its branches . ”
40:13:033:0	Jesus also used this illustration : “ The Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread . Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour , it permeated every part of the dough . ”
40:13:034:0	Jesus always used stories and illustrations like these when speaking to the crowds . In fact , he never spoke to them without using such parables .
40:13:005:1	Parable of the Wheat and Weeds Explained
40:13:035:0	This fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet : “ I will speak to you in parables.I will explain things hidden since the creation of the world . ”
40:13:036:0	Then , leaving the crowds outside , Jesus went into the house . His disciples said , “ Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field . ”
40:13:037:0	Jesus replied , “ The Son of Man is the farmer who plants the good seed .
40:13:038:0	The field is the world , and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom . The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one .
40:13:039:0	The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil . The harvest is the end of the world , and the harvesters are the angels .
40:13:040:0	“ Just as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of the world .
40:13:041:0	The Son of Man will send his angels , and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil .
40:13:042:0	And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:13:006:1	Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl
40:13:043:0	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father 's Kingdom . Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand !
40:13:044:0	“ The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field . In his excitement , he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field .
40:13:045:0	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls .
40:13:007:1	Parable of the Fishing Net
40:13:046:0	When he discovered a pearl of great value , he sold everything he owned and bought it !
40:13:047:0	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind .
40:13:048:0	When the net was full , they dragged it up onto the shore , sat down , and sorted the good fish into crates , but threw the bad ones away .
40:13:049:0	That is the way it will be at the end of the world . The angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous ,
40:13:050:0	throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:13:051:0	Do you understand all these things ? ” “ Yes , ” they said , “ we do . ”
40:13:008:1	Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
40:13:052:0	Then he added , “ Every teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who brings from his storeroom new gems of truth as well as old . ”
40:13:053:0	When Jesus had finished telling these stories and illustrations , he left that part of the country .
40:13:054:0	He returned to Nazareth , his hometown . When he taught there in the synagogue , everyone was amazed and said , “ Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles ? ”
40:13:055:0	Then they scoffed , “ He 's just the carpenter 's son , and we know Mary , his mother , and his brothers—James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas .
40:13:056:0	All his sisters live right here among us . Where did he learn all these things ? ”
40:13:057:0	And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him.Then Jesus told them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family . ”
40:13:058:0	And so he did only a few miracles there because of their unbelief .
