40:16:001:1	Leaders Demand a Miraculous Sign
40:16:001:0	One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus , demanding that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority .
40:16:002:0	He replied , “ You know the saying , ‘ Red sky at night means fair weather tomorrow ;
40:16:003:0	red sky in the morning means foul weather all day . ' You know how to interpret the weather signs in the sky , but you do n't know how to interpret the signs of the times !
40:16:002:1	Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
40:16:004:0	Only an evil , adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign , but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah. ” Then Jesus left them and went away .
40:16:005:0	Later , after they crossed to the other side of the lake , the disciples discovered they had forgotten to bring any bread .
40:16:006:0	“ Watch out ! ” Jesus warned them . “ Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40:16:007:0	At this they began to argue with each other because they had n't brought any bread .
40:16:008:0	Jesus knew what they were saying , so he said , “ You have so little faith ! Why are you arguing with each other about having no bread ?
40:16:009:0	Do n't you understand even yet ? Do n't you remember the 5,000 I fed with five loaves , and the baskets of leftovers you picked up ?
40:16:010:0	Or the 4,000 I fed with seven loaves , and the large baskets of leftovers you picked up ?
40:16:011:0	Why ca n't you understand that I 'm not talking about bread ? So again I say , ‘ Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ' ”
40:16:003:1	Peter 's Declaration about Jesus
40:16:012:0	Then at last they understood that he was n't speaking about the yeast in bread , but about the deceptive teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40:16:013:0	When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
40:16:014:0	“ Well , ” they replied , “ some say John the Baptist , some say Elijah , and others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets . ”
40:16:015:0	Then he asked them , “ But who do you say I am ? ”
40:16:016:0	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God . ”
40:16:017:0	Jesus replied , “ You are blessed , Simon son of John , because my Father in heaven has revealed this to you . You did not learn this from any human being .
40:16:018:0	Now I say to you that you are Peter ( which means ‘ rock ' ) , and upon this rock I will build my church , and all the powers of hell will not conquer it .
40:16:019:0	And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven . Whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven , and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven . ”
40:16:004:1	Jesus Predicts His Death
40:16:020:0	Then he sternly warned the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah .
40:16:021:0	From then on Jesus began to tell his disciples plainly that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem , and that he would suffer many terrible things at the hands of the elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of religious law . He would be killed , but on the third day he would be raised from the dead .
40:16:022:0	But Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things . “ Heaven forbid , Lord , ” he said . “ This will never happen to you ! ”
40:16:023:0	Jesus turned to Peter and said , “ Get away from me , Satan ! You are a dangerous trap to me . You are seeing things merely from a human point of view , not from God 's . ”
40:16:024:0	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ If any of you wants to be my follower , you must give up your own way , take up your cross , and follow me .
40:16:025:0	If you try to hang on to your life , you will lose it . But if you give up your life for my sake , you will save it .
40:16:026:0	And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul ? Is anything worth more than your soul ?
40:16:027:0	For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father and will judge all people according to their deeds .
40:16:028:0	And I tell you the truth , some standing here right now will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom . ”
