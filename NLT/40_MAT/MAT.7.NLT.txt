40:7:001:1	Do Not Judge Others
40:7:001:0	“ Do not judge others , and you will not be judged .
40:7:002:0	For you will be treated as you treat others . The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged .
40:7:003:0	“ And why worry about a speck in your friend 's eye when you have a log in your own ?
40:7:004:0	How can you think of saying to your friend , ‘ Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye , ' when you ca n't see past the log in your own eye ?
40:7:005:0	Hypocrite ! First get rid of the log in your own eye ; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend 's eye .
40:7:002:1	Effective Prayer
40:7:006:0	“ Do n't waste what is holy on people who are unholy . Do n't throw your pearls to pigs ! They will trample the pearls , then turn and attack you .
40:7:007:0	“ Keep on asking , and you will receive what you ask for . Keep on seeking , and you will find . Keep on knocking , and the door will be opened to you .
40:7:008:0	For everyone who asks , receives . Everyone who seeks , finds . And to everyone who knocks , the door will be opened .
40:7:009:0	“ You parents—if your children ask for a loaf of bread , do you give them a stone instead ?
40:7:010:0	Or if they ask for a fish , do you give them a snake ? Of course not !
40:7:003:1	The Golden Rule
40:7:011:0	So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him .
40:7:004:1	The Narrow Gate
40:7:012:0	“ Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you . This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets .
40:7:013:0	“ You can enter God 's Kingdom only through the narrow gate . The highway to hell is broad , and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way .
40:7:005:1	The Tree and Its Fruit
40:7:014:0	But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult , and only a few ever find it .
40:7:015:0	“ Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves .
40:7:016:0	You can identify them by their fruit , that is , by the way they act . Can you pick grapes from thornbushes , or figs from thistles ?
40:7:017:0	A good tree produces good fruit , and a bad tree produces bad fruit .
40:7:018:0	A good tree ca n't produce bad fruit , and a bad tree ca n't produce good fruit .
40:7:019:0	So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire .
40:7:006:1	True Disciples
40:7:020:0	Yes , just as you can identify a tree by its fruit , so you can identify people by their actions .
40:7:021:0	“ Not everyone who calls out to me , ‘ Lord ! Lord ! ' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven . Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter .
40:7:022:0	On judgment day many will say to me , ‘ Lord ! Lord ! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name . '
40:7:007:1	Building on a Solid Foundation
40:7:023:0	But I will reply , ‘ I never knew you . Get away from me , you who break God 's laws . '
40:7:024:0	“ Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise , like a person who builds a house on solid rock .
40:7:025:0	Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house , it wo n't collapse because it is built on bedrock .
40:7:026:0	But anyone who hears my teaching and does n't obey it is foolish , like a person who builds a house on sand .
40:7:027:0	When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house , it will collapse with a mighty crash . ”
40:7:028:0	When Jesus had finished saying these things , the crowds were amazed at his teaching ,
40:7:029:0	for he taught with real authority—quite unlike their teachers of religious law .
