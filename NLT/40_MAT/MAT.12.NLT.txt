40:12:001:1	A Discussion about the Sabbath
40:12:001:0	At about that time Jesus was walking through some grainfields on the Sabbath . His disciples were hungry , so they began breaking off some heads of grain and eating them .
40:12:002:0	But some Pharisees saw them do it and protested , “ Look , your disciples are breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath . ”
40:12:003:0	Jesus said to them , “ Have n't you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
40:12:004:0	He went into the house of God , and he and his companions broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat .
40:12:005:0	And have n't you read in the law of Moses that the priests on duty in the Temple may work on the Sabbath ?
40:12:006:0	I tell you , there is one here who is even greater than the Temple !
40:12:007:0	But you would not have condemned my innocent disciples if you knew the meaning of this Scripture : ‘ I want you to show mercy , not offer sacrifices . '
40:12:002:1	Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
40:12:008:0	For the Son of Man is Lord , even over the Sabbath ! ”
40:12:009:0	Then Jesus went over to their synagogue ,
40:12:010:0	where he noticed a man with a deformed hand . The Pharisees asked Jesus , “ Does the law permit a person to work by healing on the Sabbath ? ” ( They were hoping he would say yes , so they could bring charges against him . )
40:12:011:0	And he answered , “ If you had a sheep that fell into a well on the Sabbath , would n't you work to pull it out ? Of course you would .
40:12:012:0	And how much more valuable is a person than a sheep ! Yes , the law permits a person to do good on the Sabbath . ”
40:12:013:0	Then he said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” So the man held out his hand , and it was restored , just like the other one !
40:12:003:1	Jesus , God 's Chosen Servant
40:12:014:0	Then the Pharisees called a meeting to plot how to kill Jesus .
40:12:015:0	But Jesus knew what they were planning . So he left that area , and many people followed him . He healed all the sick among them ,
40:12:016:0	but he warned them not to reveal who he was .
40:12:017:0	This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah concerning him :
40:12:018:0	“ Look at my Servant , whom I have chosen.He is my Beloved , who pleases me.I will put my Spirit upon him , and he will proclaim justice to the nations .
40:12:019:0	He will not fight or shoutor raise his voice in public .
40:12:020:0	He will not crush the weakest reedor put out a flickering candle.Finally he will cause justice to be victorious .
40:12:004:1	Jesus and the Prince of Demons
40:12:021:0	And his name will be the hopeof all the world . ”
40:12:022:0	Then a demon-possessed man , who was blind and could n't speak , was brought to Jesus . He healed the man so that he could both speak and see .
40:12:023:0	The crowd was amazed and asked , “ Could it be that Jesus is the Son of David , the Messiah ? ”
40:12:024:0	But when the Pharisees heard about the miracle , they said , “ No wonder he can cast out demons . He gets his power from Satan , the prince of demons . ”
40:12:025:0	Jesus knew their thoughts and replied , “ Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed . A town or family splintered by feuding will fall apart .
40:12:026:0	And if Satan is casting out Satan , he is divided and fighting against himself . His own kingdom will not survive .
40:12:027:0	And if I am empowered by Satan , what about your own exorcists ? They cast out demons , too , so they will condemn you for what you have said .
40:12:028:0	But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God , then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you .
40:12:029:0	For who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods ? Only someone even stronger—someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house .
40:12:030:0	“ Anyone who is n't with me opposes me , and anyone who is n't working with me is actually working against me .
40:12:031:0	“ So I tell you , every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven—except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit , which will never be forgiven .
40:12:032:0	Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven , but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven , either in this world or in the world to come .
40:12:033:0	“ A tree is identified by its fruit . If a tree is good , its fruit will be good . If a tree is bad , its fruit will be bad .
40:12:034:0	You brood of snakes ! How could evil men like you speak what is good and right ? For whatever is in your heart determines what you say .
40:12:035:0	A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart , and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart .
40:12:036:0	And I tell you this , you must give an account on judgment day for every idle word you speak .
40:12:005:1	The Sign of Jonah
40:12:037:0	The words you say will either acquit you or condemn you . ”
40:12:038:0	One day some teachers of religious law and Pharisees came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we want you to show us a miraculous sign to prove your authority . ”
40:12:039:0	But Jesus replied , “ Only an evil , adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign ; but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40:12:040:0	For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights , so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights .
40:12:041:0	“ The people of Nineveh will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it , for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah . Now someone greater than Jonah is here—but you refuse to repent .
40:12:042:0	The queen of Sheba will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it , for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon . Now someone greater than Solomon is here—but you refuse to listen .
40:12:043:0	“ When an evil spirit leaves a person , it goes into the desert , seeking rest but finding none .
40:12:044:0	Then it says , ‘ I will return to the person I came from . ' So it returns and finds its former home empty , swept , and in order .
40:12:006:1	The True Family of Jesus
40:12:045:0	Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they all enter the person and live there . And so that person is worse off than before . That will be the experience of this evil generation . ”
40:12:046:0	As Jesus was speaking to the crowd , his mother and brothers stood outside , asking to speak to him .
40:12:047:0	Someone told Jesus , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , and they want to speak to you . ”
40:12:048:0	Jesus asked , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
40:12:049:0	Then he pointed to his disciples and said , “ Look , these are my mother and brothers .
40:12:050:0	Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother ! ”
