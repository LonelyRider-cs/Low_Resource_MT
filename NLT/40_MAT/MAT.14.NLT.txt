40:14:001:1	The Death of John the Baptist
40:14:001:0	When Herod Antipas , the ruler of Galilee , heard about Jesus ,
40:14:002:0	he said to his advisers , “ This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead ! That is why he can do such miracles . ”
40:14:003:0	For Herod had arrested and imprisoned John as a favor to his wife Herodias ( the former wife of Herod 's brother Philip ) .
40:14:004:0	John had been telling Herod , “ It is against God 's law for you to marry her . ”
40:14:005:0	Herod wanted to kill John , but he was afraid of a riot , because all the people believed John was a prophet .
40:14:006:0	But at a birthday party for Herod , Herodias 's daughter performed a dance that greatly pleased him ,
40:14:007:0	so he promised with a vow to give her anything she wanted .
40:14:008:0	At her mother 's urging , the girl said , “ I want the head of John the Baptist on a tray ! ”
40:14:009:0	Then the king regretted what he had said ; but because of the vow he had made in front of his guests , he issued the necessary orders .
40:14:010:0	So John was beheaded in the prison ,
40:14:011:0	and his head was brought on a tray and given to the girl , who took it to her mother .
40:14:002:1	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand
40:14:012:0	Later , John 's disciples came for his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus what had happened .
40:14:013:0	As soon as Jesus heard the news , he left in a boat to a remote area to be alone . But the crowds heard where he was headed and followed on foot from many towns .
40:14:014:0	Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat , and he had compassion on them and healed their sick .
40:14:015:0	That evening the disciples came to him and said , “ This is a remote place , and it 's already getting late . Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves . ”
40:14:016:0	But Jesus said , “ That is n't necessary—you feed them . ”
40:14:017:0	“ But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish ! ” they answered .
40:14:018:0	“ Bring them here , ” he said .
40:14:019:0	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass . Jesus took the five loaves and two fish , looked up toward heaven , and blessed them . Then , breaking the loaves into pieces , he gave the bread to the disciples , who distributed it to the people .
40:14:020:0	They all ate as much as they wanted , and afterward , the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers .
40:14:003:1	Jesus Walks on Water
40:14:021:0	About 5,000 men were fed that day , in addition to all the women and children !
40:14:022:0	Immediately after this , Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and cross to the other side of the lake , while he sent the people home .
40:14:023:0	After sending them home , he went up into the hills by himself to pray . Night fell while he was there alone .
40:14:024:0	Meanwhile , the disciples were in trouble far away from land , for a strong wind had risen , and they were fighting heavy waves .
40:14:025:0	About three o'clock in the morning Jesus came toward them , walking on the water .
40:14:026:0	When the disciples saw him walking on the water , they were terrified . In their fear , they cried out , “ It 's a ghost ! ”
40:14:027:0	But Jesus spoke to them at once . “ Do n't be afraid , ” he said . “ Take courage . I am here ! ”
40:14:028:0	Then Peter called to him , “ Lord , if it 's really you , tell me to come to you , walking on the water . ”
40:14:029:0	“ Yes , come , ” Jesus said.So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus .
40:14:030:0	But when he saw the strong wind and the waves , he was terrified and began to sink . “ Save me , Lord ! ” he shouted .
40:14:031:0	Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him . “ You have so little faith , ” Jesus said . “ Why did you doubt me ? ”
40:14:032:0	When they climbed back into the boat , the wind stopped .
40:14:033:0	Then the disciples worshiped him . “ You really are the Son of God ! ” they exclaimed .
40:14:034:0	After they had crossed the lake , they landed at Gennesaret .
40:14:035:0	When the people recognized Jesus , the news of his arrival spread quickly throughout the whole area , and soon people were bringing all their sick to be healed .
40:14:036:0	They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe , and all who touched him were healed .
