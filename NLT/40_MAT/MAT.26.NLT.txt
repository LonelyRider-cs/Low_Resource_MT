40:26:001:1	The Plot to Kill Jesus
40:26:001:0	When Jesus had finished saying all these things , he said to his disciples ,
40:26:002:0	“ As you know , Passover begins in two days , and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified . ”
40:26:003:0	At that same time the leading priests and elders were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas , the high priest ,
40:26:004:0	plotting how to capture Jesus secretly and kill him .
40:26:002:1	Jesus Anointed at Bethany
40:26:005:0	“ But not during the Passover celebration , ” they agreed , “ or the people may riot . ”
40:26:006:0	Meanwhile , Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon , a man who had previously had leprosy .
40:26:007:0	While he was eating , a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head .
40:26:008:0	The disciples were indignant when they saw this . “ What a waste ! ” they said .
40:26:009:0	“ It could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor . ”
40:26:010:0	But Jesus , aware of this , replied , “ Why criticize this woman for doing such a good thing to me ?
40:26:011:0	You will always have the poor among you , but you will not always have me .
40:26:012:0	She has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial .
40:26:003:1	Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus
40:26:013:0	I tell you the truth , wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world , this woman 's deed will be remembered and discussed . ”
40:26:014:0	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve disciples , went to the leading priests
40:26:015:0	and asked , “ How much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you ? ” And they gave him thirty pieces of silver .
40:26:004:1	The Last Supper
40:26:016:0	From that time on , Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus .
40:26:017:0	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you ? ”
40:26:018:0	“ As you go into the city , ” he told them , “ you will see a certain man . Tell him , ‘ The Teacher says : My time has come , and I will eat the Passover meal with my disciples at your house . ' ”
40:26:019:0	So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal there .
40:26:020:0	When it was evening , Jesus sat down at the table with the Twelve .
40:26:021:0	While they were eating , he said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will betray me . ”
40:26:022:0	Greatly distressed , each one asked in turn , “ Am I the one , Lord ? ”
40:26:023:0	He replied , “ One of you who has just eaten from this bowl with me will betray me .
40:26:024:0	For the Son of Man must die , as the Scriptures declared long ago . But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him . It would be far better for that man if he had never been born ! ”
40:26:025:0	Judas , the one who would betray him , also asked , “ Rabbi , am I the one ? ” And Jesus told him , “ You have said it . ”
40:26:026:0	As they were eating , Jesus took some bread and blessed it . Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples , saying , “ Take this and eat it , for this is my body . ”
40:26:027:0	And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it . He gave it to them and said , “ Each of you drink from it ,
40:26:028:0	for this is my blood , which confirms the covenant between God and his people . It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many .
40:26:029:0	Mark my words — I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father 's Kingdom . ”
40:26:005:1	Jesus Predicts Peter 's Denial
40:26:030:0	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
40:26:031:0	On the way , Jesus told them , “ Tonight all of you will desert me . For the Scriptures say , ‘ God will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . '
40:26:032:0	But after I have been raised from the dead , I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there . ”
40:26:033:0	Peter declared , “ Even if everyone else deserts you , I will never desert you . ”
40:26:034:0	Jesus replied , “ I tell you the truth , Peter — this very night , before the rooster crows , you will deny three times that you even know me . ”
40:26:006:1	Jesus Prays in Gethsemane
40:26:035:0	“ No ! ” Peter insisted . “ Even if I have to die with you , I will never deny you ! ” And all the other disciples vowed the same .
40:26:036:0	Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane , and he said , “ Sit here while I go over there to pray . ”
40:26:037:0	He took Peter and Zebedee 's two sons , James and John , and he became anguished and distressed .
40:26:038:0	He told them , “ My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death . Stay here and keep watch with me . ”
40:26:039:0	He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground , praying , “ My Father ! If it is possible , let this cup of suffering be taken away from me . Yet I want your will to be done , not mine . ”
40:26:040:0	Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ Could n't you watch with me even one hour ?
40:26:041:0	Keep watch and pray , so that you will not give in to temptation . For the spirit is willing , but the body is weak ! ”
40:26:042:0	Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed , “ My Father ! If this cup can not be taken away unless I drink it , your will be done . ”
40:26:043:0	When he returned to them again , he found them sleeping , for they could n't keep their eyes open .
40:26:044:0	So he went to pray a third time , saying the same things again .
40:26:045:0	Then he came to the disciples and said , “ Go ahead and sleep . Have your rest . But look — the time has come . The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40:26:007:1	Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested
40:26:046:0	Up , let 's be going . Look , my betrayer is here ! ”
40:26:047:0	And even as Jesus said this , Judas , one of the twelve disciples , arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs . They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people .
40:26:048:0	The traitor , Judas , had given them a prearranged signal : “ You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss . ”
40:26:049:0	So Judas came straight to Jesus . “ Greetings , Rabbi ! ” he exclaimed and gave him the kiss .
40:26:050:0	Jesus said , “ My friend , go ahead and do what you have come for. ” Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
40:26:051:0	But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest 's slave , slashing off his ear .
40:26:052:0	“ Put away your sword , ” Jesus told him . “ Those who use the sword will die by the sword .
40:26:053:0	Do n't you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands of angels to protect us , and he would send them instantly ?
40:26:054:0	But if I did , how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now ? ”
40:26:055:0	Then Jesus said to the crowd , “ Am I some dangerous revolutionary , that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me ? Why did n't you arrest me in the Temple ? I was there teaching every day .
40:26:008:1	Jesus before the Council
40:26:056:0	But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures. ” At that point , all the disciples deserted him and fled .
40:26:057:0	Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas , the high priest , where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered .
40:26:058:0	Meanwhile , Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest 's courtyard . He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end .
40:26:059:0	Inside , the leading priests and the entire high council were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus , so they could put him to death .
40:26:060:0	But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness , they could not use anyone 's testimony . Finally , two men came forward
40:26:061:0	who declared , “ This man said , ‘ I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days . ' ”
40:26:062:0	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus , “ Well , are n't you going to answer these charges ? What do you have to say for yourself ? ”
40:26:063:0	But Jesus remained silent . Then the high priest said to him , “ I demand in the name of the living God — tell us if you are the Messiah , the Son of God . ”
40:26:064:0	Jesus replied , “ You have said it . And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God 's right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven . ”
40:26:065:0	Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said , “ Blasphemy ! Why do we need other witnesses ? You have all heard his blasphemy .
40:26:066:0	What is your verdict ? ” “ Guilty ! ” they shouted . “ He deserves to die ! ”
40:26:067:0	Then they began to spit in Jesus ' face and beat him with their fists . And some slapped him ,
40:26:009:1	Peter Denies Jesus
40:26:068:0	jeering , “ Prophesy to us , you Messiah ! Who hit you that time ? ”
40:26:069:0	Meanwhile , Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . A servant girl came over and said to him , “ You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean . ”
40:26:070:0	But Peter denied it in front of everyone . “ I do n't know what you 're talking about , ” he said .
40:26:071:0	Later , out by the gate , another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
40:26:072:0	Again Peter denied it , this time with an oath . “ I do n't even know the man , ” he said .
40:26:073:0	A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said , “ You must be one of them ; we can tell by your Galilean accent . ”
40:26:074:0	Peter swore , “ A curse on me if I 'm lying — I do n't know the man ! ” And immediately the rooster crowed .
40:26:075:0	Suddenly , Jesus ' words flashed through Peter 's mind : “ Before the rooster crows , you will deny three times that you even know me. ” And he went away , weeping bitterly .
