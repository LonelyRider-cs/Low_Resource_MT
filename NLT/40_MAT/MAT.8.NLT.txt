40:8:001:1	Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy
40:8:001:0	Large crowds followed Jesus as he came down the mountainside .
40:8:002:0	Suddenly , a man with leprosy approached him and knelt before him . “ Lord , ” the man said , “ if you are willing , you can heal me and make me clean . ”
40:8:003:0	Jesus reached out and touched him . “ I am willing , ” he said . “ Be healed ! ” And instantly the leprosy disappeared .
40:8:002:1	The Faith of a Roman Officer
40:8:004:0	Then Jesus said to him , “ Do n't tell anyone about this . Instead , go to the priest and let him examine you . Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy . This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed . ”
40:8:005:0	When Jesus returned to Capernaum , a Roman officer came and pleaded with him ,
40:8:006:0	“ Lord , my young servant lies in bed , paralyzed and in terrible pain . ”
40:8:007:0	Jesus said , “ I will come and heal him . ”
40:8:008:0	But the officer said , “ Lord , I am not worthy to have you come into my home . Just say the word from where you are , and my servant will be healed .
40:8:009:0	I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers , and I have authority over my soldiers . I only need to say , ‘ Go , ' and they go , or ‘ Come , ' and they come . And if I say to my slaves , ‘ Do this , ' they do it . ”
40:8:010:0	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed . Turning to those who were following him , he said , “ I tell you the truth , I have n't seen faith like this in all Israel !
40:8:011:0	And I tell you this , that many Gentiles will come from all over the world — from east and west — and sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob at the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven .
40:8:012:0	But many Israelites — those for whom the Kingdom was prepared — will be thrown into outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40:8:003:1	Jesus Heals Many People
40:8:013:0	Then Jesus said to the Roman officer , “ Go back home . Because you believed , it has happened. ” And the young servant was healed that same hour .
40:8:014:0	When Jesus arrived at Peter 's house , Peter 's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever .
40:8:015:0	But when Jesus touched her hand , the fever left her . Then she got up and prepared a meal for him .
40:8:016:0	That evening many demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus . He cast out the evil spirits with a simple command , and he healed all the sick .
40:8:004:1	The Cost of Following Jesus
40:8:017:0	This fulfilled the word of the Lord through the prophet Isaiah , who said , “ He took our sicknessesand removed our diseases . ”
40:8:018:0	When Jesus saw the crowd around him , he instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake .
40:8:019:0	Then one of the teachers of religious law said to him , “ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . ”
40:8:020:0	But Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens to live in , and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place even to lay his head . ”
40:8:021:0	Another of his disciples said , “ Lord , first let me return home and bury my father . ”
40:8:005:1	Jesus Calms the Storm
40:8:022:0	But Jesus told him , “ Follow me now . Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead . ”
40:8:023:0	Then Jesus got into the boat and started across the lake with his disciples .
40:8:024:0	Suddenly , a fierce storm struck the lake , with waves breaking into the boat . But Jesus was sleeping .
40:8:025:0	The disciples went and woke him up , shouting , “ Lord , save us ! We 're going to drown ! ”
40:8:026:0	Jesus responded , “ Why are you afraid ? You have so little faith ! ” Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves , and suddenly there was a great calm .
40:8:006:1	Jesus Heals Two Demon-Possessed Men
40:8:027:0	The disciples were amazed . “ Who is this man ? ” they asked . “ Even the winds and waves obey him ! ”
40:8:028:0	When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake , in the region of the Gadarenes , two men who were possessed by demons met him . They came out of the tombs and were so violent that no one could go through that area .
40:8:029:0	They began screaming at him , “ Why are you interfering with us , Son of God ? Have you come here to torture us before God 's appointed time ? ”
40:8:030:0	There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding in the distance .
40:8:031:0	So the demons begged , “ If you cast us out , send us into that herd of pigs . ”
40:8:032:0	“ All right , go ! ” Jesus commanded them . So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs , and the whole herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water .
40:8:033:0	The herdsmen fled to the nearby town , telling everyone what happened to the demon-possessed men .
40:8:034:0	Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus , but they begged him to go away and leave them alone .
