40:25:001:1	Parable of the Ten Bridesmaids
40:25:001:0	“ Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom .
40:25:002:0	Five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40:25:003:0	The five who were foolish did n't take enough olive oil for their lamps ,
40:25:004:0	but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil .
40:25:005:0	When the bridegroom was delayed , they all became drowsy and fell asleep .
40:25:006:0	“ At midnight they were roused by the shout , ‘ Look , the bridegroom is coming ! Come out and meet him ! '
40:25:007:0	“ All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps .
40:25:008:0	Then the five foolish ones asked the others , ‘ Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out . '
40:25:009:0	“ But the others replied , ‘ We do n't have enough for all of us . Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves . '
40:25:010:0	“ But while they were gone to buy oil , the bridegroom came . Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was locked .
40:25:011:0	Later , when the other five bridesmaids returned , they stood outside , calling , ‘ Lord ! Lord ! Open the door for us ! '
40:25:012:0	“ But he called back , ‘ Believe me , I do n't know you ! '
40:25:002:1	Parable of the Three Servants
40:25:013:0	“ So you , too , must keep watch ! For you do not know the day or hour of my return .
40:25:014:0	“ Again , the Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip . He called together his servants and entrusted his money to them while he was gone .
40:25:015:0	He gave five bags of silver to one , two bags of silver to another , and one bag of silver to the last — dividing it in proportion to their abilities . He then left on his trip .
40:25:016:0	“ The servant who received the five bags of silver began to invest the money and earned five more .
40:25:017:0	The servant with two bags of silver also went to work and earned two more .
40:25:018:0	But the servant who received the one bag of silver dug a hole in the ground and hid the master 's money .
40:25:019:0	“ After a long time their master returned from his trip and called them to give an account of how they had used his money .
40:25:020:0	The servant to whom he had entrusted the five bags of silver came forward with five more and said , ‘ Master , you gave me five bags of silver to invest , and I have earned five more . '
40:25:021:0	“ The master was full of praise . ‘ Well done , my good and faithful servant . You have been faithful in handling this small amount , so now I will give you many more responsibilities . Let 's celebrate together ! '
40:25:022:0	“ The servant who had received the two bags of silver came forward and said , ‘ Master , you gave me two bags of silver to invest , and I have earned two more . '
40:25:023:0	“ The master said , ‘ Well done , my good and faithful servant . You have been faithful in handling this small amount , so now I will give you many more responsibilities . Let 's celebrate together ! '
40:25:024:0	“ Then the servant with the one bag of silver came and said , ‘ Master , I knew you were a harsh man , harvesting crops you did n't plant and gathering crops you did n't cultivate .
40:25:025:0	I was afraid I would lose your money , so I hid it in the earth . Look , here is your money back . '
40:25:026:0	“ But the master replied , ‘ You wicked and lazy servant ! If you knew I harvested crops I did n't plant and gathered crops I did n't cultivate ,
40:25:027:0	why did n't you deposit my money in the bank ? At least I could have gotten some interest on it . '
40:25:028:0	“ Then he ordered , ‘ Take the money from this servant , and give it to the one with the ten bags of silver .
40:25:029:0	To those who use well what they are given , even more will be given , and they will have an abundance . But from those who do nothing , even what little they have will be taken away .
40:25:003:1	The Final Judgment
40:25:030:0	Now throw this useless servant into outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . '
40:25:031:0	“ But when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then he will sit upon his glorious throne .
40:25:032:0	All the nations will be gathered in his presence , and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40:25:033:0	He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his left .
40:25:034:0	“ Then the King will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by my Father , inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world .
40:25:035:0	For I was hungry , and you fed me . I was thirsty , and you gave me a drink . I was a stranger , and you invited me into your home .
40:25:036:0	I was naked , and you gave me clothing . I was sick , and you cared for me . I was in prison , and you visited me . '
40:25:037:0	“ Then these righteous ones will reply , ‘ Lord , when did we ever see you hungry and feed you ? Or thirsty and give you something to drink ?
40:25:038:0	Or a stranger and show you hospitality ? Or naked and give you clothing ?
40:25:039:0	When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you ? '
40:25:040:0	“ And the King will say , ‘ I tell you the truth , when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters , you were doing it to me ! '
40:25:041:0	“ Then the King will turn to those on the left and say , ‘ Away with you , you cursed ones , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons .
40:25:042:0	For I was hungry , and you did n't feed me . I was thirsty , and you did n't give me a drink .
40:25:043:0	I was a stranger , and you did n't invite me into your home . I was naked , and you did n't give me clothing . I was sick and in prison , and you did n't visit me . '
40:25:044:0	“ Then they will reply , ‘ Lord , when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and not help you ? '
40:25:045:0	“ And he will answer , ‘ I tell you the truth , when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters , you were refusing to help me . '
40:25:046:0	“ And they will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous will go into eternal life . ”
