40:24:001:1	Jesus Speaks about the Future
40:24:001:0	As Jesus was leaving the Temple grounds , his disciples pointed out to him the various Temple buildings .
40:24:002:0	But he responded , “ Do you see all these buildings ? I tell you the truth , they will be completely demolished . Not one stone will be left on top of another ! ”
40:24:003:0	Later , Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives . His disciples came to him privately and said , “ Tell us , when will all this happen ? What sign will signal your return and the end of the world ? ”
40:24:004:0	Jesus told them , “ Do n't let anyone mislead you ,
40:24:005:0	for many will come in my name , claiming , ‘ I am the Messiah . ' They will deceive many .
40:24:006:0	And you will hear of wars and threats of wars , but do n't panic . Yes , these things must take place , but the end wo n't follow immediately .
40:24:007:0	Nation will go to war against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world .
40:24:008:0	But all this is only the first of the birth pains , with more to come .
40:24:009:0	“ Then you will be arrested , persecuted , and killed . You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers .
40:24:010:0	And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other .
40:24:011:0	And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people .
40:24:012:0	Sin will be rampant everywhere , and the love of many will grow cold .
40:24:013:0	But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
40:24:014:0	And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world , so that all nations will hear it ; and then the end will come .
40:24:015:0	“ The day is coming when you will see what Daniel the prophet spoke about — the sacrilegious object that causes desecration standing in the Holy Place. ” ( Reader , pay attention ! )
40:24:016:0	“ Then those in Judea must flee to the hills .
40:24:017:0	A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack .
40:24:018:0	A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat .
40:24:019:0	How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days .
40:24:020:0	And pray that your flight will not be in winter or on the Sabbath .
40:24:021:0	For there will be greater anguish than at any time since the world began . And it will never be so great again .
40:24:022:0	In fact , unless that time of calamity is shortened , not a single person will survive . But it will be shortened for the sake of God 's chosen ones .
40:24:023:0	“ Then if anyone tells you , ‘ Look , here is the Messiah , ' or ‘ There he is , ' do n't believe it .
40:24:024:0	For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to deceive , if possible , even God 's chosen ones .
40:24:025:0	See , I have warned you about this ahead of time .
40:24:026:0	“ So if someone tells you , ‘ Look , the Messiah is out in the desert , ' do n't bother to go and look . Or , ‘ Look , he is hiding here , ' do n't believe it !
40:24:027:0	For as the lightning flashes in the east and shines to the west , so it will be when the Son of Man comes .
40:24:028:0	Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby , so these signs indicate that the end is near .
40:24:029:0	“ Immediately after the anguish of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will give no light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
40:24:030:0	And then at last , the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens , and there will be deep mourning among all the peoples of the earth . And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40:24:031:0	And he will send out his angels with the mighty blast of a trumpet , and they will gather his chosen ones from all over the world — from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven .
40:24:032:0	“ Now learn a lesson from the fig tree . When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout , you know that summer is near .
40:24:033:0	In the same way , when you see all these things , you can know his return is very near , right at the door .
40:24:034:0	I tell you the truth , this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things take place .
40:24:035:0	Heaven and earth will disappear , but my words will never disappear .
40:24:036:0	“ However , no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen , not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself . Only the Father knows .
40:24:037:0	“ When the Son of Man returns , it will be like it was in Noah 's day .
40:24:038:0	In those days before the flood , the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat .
40:24:039:0	People did n't realize what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away . That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes .
40:24:040:0	“ Two men will be working together in the field ; one will be taken , the other left .
40:24:041:0	Two women will be grinding flour at the mill ; one will be taken , the other left .
40:24:042:0	“ So you , too , must keep watch ! For you do n't know what day your Lord is coming .
40:24:043:0	Understand this : If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming , he would keep watch and not permit his house to be broken into .
40:24:044:0	You also must be ready all the time , for the Son of Man will come when least expected .
40:24:045:0	“ A faithful , sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them .
40:24:046:0	If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job , there will be a reward .
40:24:047:0	I tell you the truth , the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns .
40:24:048:0	But what if the servant is evil and thinks , ‘ My master wo n't be back for a while , '
40:24:049:0	and he begins beating the other servants , partying , and getting drunk ?
40:24:050:0	The master will return unannounced and unexpected ,
40:24:051:0	and he will cut the servant to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
