40:21:001:1	Jesus ' Triumphant Entry
40:21:001:0	As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem , they came to the town of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent two of them on ahead .
40:21:002:0	“ Go into the village over there , ” he said . “ As soon as you enter it , you will see a donkey tied there , with its colt beside it . Untie them and bring them to me .
40:21:003:0	If anyone asks what you are doing , just say , ‘ The Lord needs them , ' and he will immediately let you take them . ”
40:21:004:0	This took place to fulfill the prophecy that said ,
40:21:005:0	“ Tell the people of Jerusalem , ‘ Look , your King is coming to you.He is humble , riding on a donkey — riding on a donkey 's colt . ' ”
40:21:006:0	The two disciples did as Jesus commanded .
40:21:007:0	They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt , and he sat on it .
40:21:008:0	Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him , and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40:21:009:0	Jesus was in the center of the procession , and the people all around him were shouting , “ Praise God for the Son of David ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Praise God in highest heaven ! ”
40:21:010:0	The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered . “ Who is this ? ” they asked .
40:21:002:1	Jesus Clears the Temple
40:21:011:0	And the crowds replied , “ It 's Jesus , the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee . ”
40:21:012:0	Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice . He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves .
40:21:013:0	He said to them , “ The Scriptures declare , ‘ My Temple will be called a house of prayer , ' but you have turned it into a den of thieves ! ”
40:21:014:0	The blind and the lame came to him in the Temple , and he healed them .
40:21:015:0	The leading priests and the teachers of religious law saw these wonderful miracles and heard even the children in the Temple shouting , “ Praise God for the Son of David. ” But the leaders were indignant .
40:21:016:0	They asked Jesus , “ Do you hear what these children are saying ? ” “ Yes , ” Jesus replied . “ Have n't you ever read the Scriptures ? For they say , ‘ You have taught children and infants to give you praise . ' ”
40:21:003:1	Jesus Curses the Fig Tree
40:21:017:0	Then he returned to Bethany , where he stayed overnight .
40:21:018:0	In the morning , as Jesus was returning to Jerusalem , he was hungry ,
40:21:019:0	and he noticed a fig tree beside the road . He went over to see if there were any figs , but there were only leaves . Then he said to it , “ May you never bear fruit again ! ” And immediately the fig tree withered up .
40:21:020:0	The disciples were amazed when they saw this and asked , “ How did the fig tree wither so quickly ? ”
40:21:021:0	Then Jesus told them , “ I tell you the truth , if you have faith and do n't doubt , you can do things like this and much more . You can even say to this mountain , ‘ May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ' and it will happen .
40:21:004:1	The Authority of Jesus Challenged
40:21:022:0	You can pray for anything , and if you have faith , you will receive it . ”
40:21:023:0	When Jesus returned to the Temple and began teaching , the leading priests and elders came up to him . They demanded , “ By what authority are you doing all these things ? Who gave you the right ? ”
40:21:024:0	“ I 'll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question , ” Jesus replied .
40:21:025:0	“ Did John 's authority to baptize come from heaven , or was it merely human ? ” They talked it over among themselves . “ If we say it was from heaven , he will ask us why we did n't believe John .
40:21:026:0	But if we say it was merely human , we 'll be mobbed because the people believe John was a prophet . ”
40:21:005:1	Parable of the Two Sons
40:21:027:0	So they finally replied , “ We do n't know. ” And Jesus responded , “ Then I wo n't tell you by what authority I do these things .
40:21:028:0	“ But what do you think about this ? A man with two sons told the older boy , ‘ Son , go out and work in the vineyard today . '
40:21:029:0	The son answered , ‘ No , I wo n't go , ' but later he changed his mind and went anyway .
40:21:030:0	Then the father told the other son , ‘ You go , ' and he said , ‘ Yes , sir , I will . ' But he did n't go .
40:21:031:0	“ Which of the two obeyed his father ? ” They replied , “ The first. ” Then Jesus explained his meaning : “ I tell you the truth , corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom of God before you do .
40:21:006:1	Parable of the Evil Farmers
40:21:032:0	For John the Baptist came and showed you the right way to live , but you did n't believe him , while tax collectors and prostitutes did . And even when you saw this happening , you refused to believe him and repent of your sins .
40:21:033:0	“ Now listen to another story . A certain landowner planted a vineyard , built a wall around it , dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice , and built a lookout tower . Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country .
40:21:034:0	At the time of the grape harvest , he sent his servants to collect his share of the crop .
40:21:035:0	But the farmers grabbed his servants , beat one , killed one , and stoned another .
40:21:036:0	So the landowner sent a larger group of his servants to collect for him , but the results were the same .
40:21:037:0	“ Finally , the owner sent his son , thinking , ‘ Surely they will respect my son . '
40:21:038:0	“ But when the tenant farmers saw his son coming , they said to one another , ‘ Here comes the heir to this estate . Come on , let 's kill him and get the estate for ourselves ! '
40:21:039:0	So they grabbed him , dragged him out of the vineyard , and murdered him .
40:21:040:0	“ When the owner of the vineyard returns , ” Jesus asked , “ what do you think he will do to those farmers ? ”
40:21:041:0	The religious leaders replied , “ He will put the wicked men to a horrible death and lease the vineyard to others who will give him his share of the crop after each harvest . ”
40:21:042:0	Then Jesus asked them , “ Did n't you ever read this in the Scriptures ? ‘ The stone that the builders rejectedhas now become the cornerstone.This is the 's doing , and it is wonderful to see . '
40:21:043:0	I tell you , the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit .
40:21:044:0	Anyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces , and it will crush anyone it falls on . ”
40:21:045:0	When the leading priests and Pharisees heard this parable , they realized he was telling the story against them — they were the wicked farmers .
40:21:046:0	They wanted to arrest him , but they were afraid of the crowds , who considered Jesus to be a prophet .
