40:11:001:1	Jesus and John the Baptist
40:11:001:0	When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples , he went out to teach and preach in towns throughout the region .
40:11:002:0	John the Baptist , who was in prison , heard about all the things the Messiah was doing . So he sent his disciples to ask Jesus ,
40:11:003:0	“ Are you the Messiah we 've been expecting , or should we keep looking for someone else ? ”
40:11:004:0	Jesus told them , “ Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen —
40:11:005:0	the blind see , the lame walk , those with leprosy are cured , the deaf hear , the dead are raised to life , and the Good News is being preached to the poor . ”
40:11:006:0	And he added , “ God blesses those who do not fall away because of me . ”
40:11:007:0	As John 's disciples were leaving , Jesus began talking about him to the crowds . “ What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see ? Was he a weak reed , swayed by every breath of wind ?
40:11:008:0	Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes ? No , people with expensive clothes live in palaces .
40:11:009:0	Were you looking for a prophet ? Yes , and he is more than a prophet .
40:11:010:0	John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say , ‘ Look , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , and he will prepare your way before you . '
40:11:011:0	“ I tell you the truth , of all who have ever lived , none is greater than John the Baptist . Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is !
40:11:012:0	And from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now , the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing , and violent people are attacking it .
40:11:013:0	For before John came , all the prophets and the law of Moses looked forward to this present time .
40:11:014:0	And if you are willing to accept what I say , he is Elijah , the one the prophets said would come .
40:11:015:0	Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand !
40:11:016:0	“ To what can I compare this generation ? It is like children playing a game in the public square . They complain to their friends ,
40:11:017:0	‘ We played wedding songs , and you did n't dance , so we played funeral songs , and you did n't mourn . '
40:11:018:0	For John did n't spend his time eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ He 's possessed by a demon . '
40:11:002:1	Judgment for the Unbelievers
40:11:019:0	The Son of Man , on the other hand , feasts and drinks , and you say , ‘ He 's a glutton and a drunkard , and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners ! ' But wisdom is shown to be right by its results . ”
40:11:020:0	Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles , because they had n't repented of their sins and turned to God .
40:11:021:0	“ What sorrow awaits you , Korazin and Bethsaida ! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon , their people would have repented of their sins long ago , clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse .
40:11:022:0	I tell you , Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you .
40:11:023:0	“ And you people of Capernaum , will you be honored in heaven ? No , you will go down to the place of the dead . For if the miracles I did for you had been done in wicked Sodom , it would still be here today .
40:11:003:1	Jesus ' Prayer of Thanksgiving
40:11:024:0	I tell you , even Sodom will be better off on judgment day than you . ”
40:11:025:0	At that time Jesus prayed this prayer : “ O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever , and for revealing them to the childlike .
40:11:026:0	Yes , Father , it pleased you to do it this way !
40:11:027:0	“ My Father has entrusted everything to me . No one truly knows the Son except the Father , and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him . ”
40:11:028:0	Then Jesus said , “ Come to me , all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens , and I will give you rest .
40:11:029:0	Take my yoke upon you . Let me teach you , because I am humble and gentle at heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
40:11:030:0	For my yoke is easy to bear , and the burden I give you is light . ”
