40:28:001:1	The Resurrection
40:28:001:0	Early on Sunday morning , as the new day was dawning , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went out to visit the tomb .
40:28:002:0	Suddenly there was a great earthquake ! For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven , rolled aside the stone , and sat on it .
40:28:003:0	His face shone like lightning , and his clothing was as white as snow .
40:28:004:0	The guards shook with fear when they saw him , and they fell into a dead faint .
40:28:005:0	Then the angel spoke to the women . “ Do n't be afraid ! ” he said . “ I know you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
40:28:006:0	He is n't here ! He is risen from the dead , just as he said would happen . Come , see where his body was lying .
40:28:007:0	And now , go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead , and he is going ahead of you to Galilee . You will see him there . Remember what I have told you . ”
40:28:008:0	The women ran quickly from the tomb . They were very frightened but also filled with great joy , and they rushed to give the disciples the angel 's message .
40:28:009:0	And as they went , Jesus met them and greeted them . And they ran to him , grasped his feet , and worshiped him .
40:28:002:1	The Report of the Guard
40:28:010:0	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do n't be afraid ! Go tell my brothers to leave for Galilee , and they will see me there . ”
40:28:011:0	As the women were on their way , some of the guards went into the city and told the leading priests what had happened .
40:28:012:0	A meeting with the elders was called , and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe .
40:28:013:0	They told the soldiers , “ You must say , ‘ Jesus ' disciples came during the night while we were sleeping , and they stole his body . '
40:28:014:0	If the governor hears about it , we 'll stand up for you so you wo n't get in trouble . ”
40:28:003:1	The Great Commission
40:28:015:0	So the guards accepted the bribe and said what they were told to say . Their story spread widely among the Jews , and they still tell it today .
40:28:016:0	Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee , going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go .
40:28:017:0	When they saw him , they worshiped him—but some of them doubted !
40:28:018:0	Jesus came and told his disciples , “ I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth .
40:28:019:0	Therefore , go and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit .
40:28:020:0	Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you . And be sure of this : I am with you always , even to the end of the age . ”
