40:17:001:1	The Transfiguration
40:17:001:0	Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers , James and John , and led them up a high mountain to be alone .
40:17:002:0	As the men watched , Jesus ' appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun , and his clothes became as white as light .
40:17:003:0	Suddenly , Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus .
40:17:004:0	Peter exclaimed , “ Lord , it 's wonderful for us to be here ! If you want , I 'll make three shelters as memorials—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40:17:005:0	But even as he spoke , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my dearly loved Son , who brings me great joy . Listen to him . ”
40:17:006:0	The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground .
40:17:007:0	Then Jesus came over and touched them . “ Get up , ” he said . “ Do n't be afraid . ”
40:17:008:0	And when they looked up , Moses and Elijah were gone , and they saw only Jesus .
40:17:009:0	As they went back down the mountain , Jesus commanded them , “ Do n't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead . ”
40:17:010:0	Then his disciples asked him , “ Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes ? ”
40:17:011:0	Jesus replied , “ Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready .
40:17:012:0	But I tell you , Elijah has already come , but he was n't recognized , and they chose to abuse him . And in the same way they will also make the Son of Man suffer . ”
40:17:002:1	Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy
40:17:013:0	Then the disciples realized he was talking about John the Baptist .
40:17:014:0	At the foot of the mountain , a large crowd was waiting for them . A man came and knelt before Jesus and said ,
40:17:015:0	“ Lord , have mercy on my son . He has seizures and suffers terribly . He often falls into the fire or into the water .
40:17:016:0	So I brought him to your disciples , but they could n't heal him . ”
40:17:017:0	Jesus said , “ You faithless and corrupt people ! How long must I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me . ”
40:17:018:0	Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy , and it left him . From that moment the boy was well .
40:17:019:0	Afterward the disciples asked Jesus privately , “ Why could n't we cast out that demon ? ”
40:17:003:1	Jesus Again Predicts His Death
40:17:020:0	“ You do n't have enough faith , ” Jesus told them . “ I tell you the truth , if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed , you could say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ' and it would move . Nothing would be impossible . ”
40:17:022:0	After they gathered again in Galilee , Jesus told them , “ The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies .
40:17:004:1	Payment of the Temple Tax
40:17:023:0	He will be killed , but on the third day he will be raised from the dead. ” And the disciples were filled with grief .
40:17:024:0	On their arrival in Capernaum , the collectors of the Temple tax came to Peter and asked him , “ Does n't your teacher pay the Temple tax ? ”
40:17:025:0	“ Yes , he does , ” Peter replied . Then he went into the house.But before he had a chance to speak , Jesus asked him , “ What do you think , Peter ? Do kings tax their own people or the people they have conquered ? ”
40:17:026:0	“ They tax the people they have conquered , ” Peter replied. “ Well , then , ” Jesus said , “ the citizens are free !
40:17:027:0	However , we do n't want to offend them , so go down to the lake and throw in a line . Open the mouth of the first fish you catch , and you will find a large silver coin . Take it and pay the tax for both of us . ”
