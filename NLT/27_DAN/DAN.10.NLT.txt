27:10:001:1	Daniel 's Vision of a Messenger
27:10:001:0	In the third year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia , Daniel ( also known as Belteshazzar ) had another vision . He understood that the vision concerned events certain to happen in the future—times of war and great hardship .
27:10:002:0	When this vision came to me , I , Daniel , had been in mourning for three whole weeks .
27:10:003:0	All that time I had eaten no rich food . No meat or wine crossed my lips , and I used no fragrant lotions until those three weeks had passed .
27:10:004:0	On April 23 , as I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River ,
27:10:005:0	I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothing , with a belt of pure gold around his waist .
27:10:006:0	His body looked like a precious gem . His face flashed like lightning , and his eyes flamed like torches . His arms and feet shone like polished bronze , and his voice roared like a vast multitude of people .
27:10:007:0	Only I , Daniel , saw this vision . The men with me saw nothing , but they were suddenly terrified and ran away to hide .
27:10:008:0	So I was left there all alone to see this amazing vision . My strength left me , my face grew deathly pale , and I felt very weak .
27:10:009:0	Then I heard the man speak , and when I heard the sound of his voice , I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground .
27:10:010:0	Just then a hand touched me and lifted me , still trembling , to my hands and knees .
27:10:011:0	And the man said to me , “ Daniel , you are very precious to God , so listen carefully to what I have to say to you . Stand up , for I have been sent to you. ” When he said this to me , I stood up , still trembling .
27:10:012:0	Then he said , “ Do n't be afraid , Daniel . Since the first day you began to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God , your request has been heard in heaven . I have come in answer to your prayer .
27:10:013:0	But for twenty-one days the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way . Then Michael , one of the archangels , came to help me , and I left him there with the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia .
27:10:014:0	Now I am here to explain what will happen to your people in the future , for this vision concerns a time yet to come . ”
27:10:015:0	While he was speaking to me , I looked down at the ground , unable to say a word .
27:10:016:0	Then the one who looked like a man touched my lips , and I opened my mouth and began to speak . I said to the one standing in front of me , “ I am filled with anguish because of the vision I have seen , my lord , and I am very weak .
27:10:017:0	How can someone like me , your servant , talk to you , my lord ? My strength is gone , and I can hardly breathe . ”
27:10:018:0	Then the one who looked like a man touched me again , and I felt my strength returning .
27:10:019:0	“ Do n't be afraid , ” he said , “ for you are very precious to God . Peace ! Be encouraged ! Be strong ! ” As he spoke these words to me , I suddenly felt stronger and said to him , “ Please speak to me , my lord , for you have strengthened me . ”
27:10:020:0	He replied , “ Do you know why I have come ? Soon I must return to fight against the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia , and after that the spirit prince of the kingdom of Greece will come .
27:10:021:0	Meanwhile , I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth . ( No one helps me against these spirit princes except Michael , your spirit prince .
27:10:022:0	I have been standing beside Michael to support and strengthen him since the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede . )
