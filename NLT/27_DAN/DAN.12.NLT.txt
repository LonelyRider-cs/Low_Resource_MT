27:12:001:1	The Time of the End
27:12:001:0	“ At that time Michael , the archangel who stands guard over your nation , will arise . Then there will be a time of anguish greater than any since nations first came into existence . But at that time every one of your people whose name is written in the book will be rescued .
27:12:002:0	Many of those whose bodies lie dead and buried will rise up , some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting disgrace .
27:12:003:0	Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky , and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever .
27:12:004:0	But you , Daniel , keep this prophecy a secret ; seal up the book until the time of the end , when many will rush here and there , and knowledge will increase . ”
27:12:005:0	Then I , Daniel , looked and saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river .
27:12:006:0	One of them asked the man dressed in linen , who was now standing above the river , “ How long will it be until these shocking events are over ? ”
27:12:007:0	The man dressed in linen , who was standing above the river , raised both his hands toward heaven and took a solemn oath by the One who lives forever , saying , “ It will go on for a time , times , and half a time . When the shattering of the holy people has finally come to an end , all these things will have happened . ”
27:12:008:0	I heard what he said , but I did not understand what he meant . So I asked , “ How will all this finally end , my lord ? ”
27:12:009:0	But he said , “ Go now , Daniel , for what I have said is kept secret and sealed until the time of the end .
27:12:010:0	Many will be purified , cleansed , and refined by these trials . But the wicked will continue in their wickedness , and none of them will understand . Only those who are wise will know what it means .
27:12:011:0	“ From the time the daily sacrifice is stopped and the sacrilegious object that causes desecration is set up to be worshiped , there will be 1,290 days .
27:12:012:0	And blessed are those who wait and remain until the end of the 1,335 days !
27:12:013:0	“ As for you , go your way until the end . You will rest , and then at the end of the days , you will rise again to receive the inheritance set aside for you . ”
