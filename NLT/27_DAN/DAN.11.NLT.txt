27:11:001:1	Kings of the South and North
27:11:001:0	
27:11:002:0	“ Now then , I will reveal the truth to you . Three more Persian kings will reign , to be succeeded by a fourth , far richer than the others . He will use his wealth to stir up everyone to fight against the kingdom of Greece .
27:11:003:0	“ Then a mighty king will rise to power who will rule with great authority and accomplish everything he sets out to do .
27:11:004:0	But at the height of his power , his kingdom will be broken apart and divided into four parts . It will not be ruled by the king 's descendants , nor will the kingdom hold the authority it once had . For his empire will be uprooted and given to others .
27:11:005:0	“ The king of the south will increase in power , but one of his own officials will become more powerful than he and will rule his kingdom with great strength .
27:11:006:0	“ Some years later an alliance will be formed between the king of the north and the king of the south . The daughter of the king of the south will be given in marriage to the king of the north to secure the alliance , but she will lose her influence over him , and so will her father . She will be abandoned along with her supporters .
27:11:007:0	But when one of her relatives becomes king of the south , he will raise an army and enter the fortress of the king of the north and defeat him .
27:11:008:0	When he returns to Egypt , he will carry back their idols with him , along with priceless articles of gold and silver . For some years afterward he will leave the king of the north alone .
27:11:009:0	“ Later the king of the north will invade the realm of the king of the south but will soon return to his own land .
27:11:010:0	However , the sons of the king of the north will assemble a mighty army that will advance like a flood and carry the battle as far as the enemy 's fortress .
27:11:011:0	“ Then , in a rage , the king of the south will rally against the vast forces assembled by the king of the north and will defeat them .
27:11:012:0	After the enemy army is swept away , the king of the south will be filled with pride and will execute many thousands of his enemies . But his success will be short lived .
27:11:013:0	“ A few years later the king of the north will return with a fully equipped army far greater than before .
27:11:014:0	At that time there will be a general uprising against the king of the south . Violent men among your own people will join them in fulfillment of this vision , but they will not succeed .
27:11:015:0	Then the king of the north will come and lay siege to a fortified city and capture it . The best troops of the south will not be able to stand in the face of the onslaught .
27:11:016:0	“ The king of the north will march onward unopposed ; none will be able to stop him . He will pause in the glorious land of Israel , intent on destroying it .
27:11:017:0	He will make plans to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will form an alliance with the king of the south . He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom from within , but his plan will fail .
27:11:018:0	“ After this , he will turn his attention to the coastland and conquer many cities . But a commander from another land will put an end to his insolence and cause him to retreat in shame .
27:11:019:0	He will take refuge in his own fortresses but will stumble and fall and be seen no more .
27:11:020:0	“ His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor . But after a very brief reign , he will die , though not from anger or in battle .
27:11:021:0	“ The next to come to power will be a despicable man who is not in line for royal succession . He will slip in when least expected and take over the kingdom by flattery and intrigue .
27:11:022:0	Before him great armies will be swept away , including a covenant prince .
27:11:023:0	With deceitful promises , he will make various alliances . He will become strong despite having only a handful of followers .
27:11:024:0	Without warning he will enter the richest areas of the land . Then he will distribute among his followers the plunder and wealth of the rich—something his predecessors had never done . He will plot the overthrow of strongholds , but this will last for only a short while .
27:11:025:0	“ Then he will stir up his courage and raise a great army against the king of the south . The king of the south will go to battle with a mighty army , but to no avail , for there will be plots against him .
27:11:026:0	His own household will cause his downfall . His army will be swept away , and many will be killed .
27:11:027:0	Seeking nothing but each other 's harm , these kings will plot against each other at the conference table , attempting to deceive each other . But it will make no difference , for the end will come at the appointed time .
27:11:028:0	“ The king of the north will then return home with great riches . On the way he will set himself against the people of the holy covenant , doing much damage before continuing his journey .
27:11:029:0	“ Then at the appointed time he will once again invade the south , but this time the result will be different .
27:11:030:0	For warships from western coastlands will scare him off , and he will withdraw and return home . But he will vent his anger against the people of the holy covenant and reward those who forsake the covenant .
27:11:031:0	“ His army will take over the Temple fortress , pollute the sanctuary , put a stop to the daily sacrifices , and set up the sacrilegious object that causes desecration .
27:11:032:0	He will flatter and win over those who have violated the covenant . But the people who know their God will be strong and will resist him .
27:11:033:0	“ Wise leaders will give instruction to many , but these teachers will die by fire and sword , or they will be jailed and robbed .
27:11:034:0	During these persecutions , little help will arrive , and many who join them will not be sincere .
27:11:035:0	And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution . In this way , they will be refined and cleansed and made pure until the time of the end , for the appointed time is still to come .
27:11:036:0	“ The king will do as he pleases , exalting himself and claiming to be greater than every god , even blaspheming the God of gods . He will succeed , but only until the time of wrath is completed . For what has been determined will surely take place .
27:11:037:0	He will have no respect for the gods of his ancestors , or for the god loved by women , or for any other god , for he will boast that he is greater than them all .
27:11:038:0	Instead of these , he will worship the god of fortresses—a god his ancestors never knew—and lavish on him gold , silver , precious stones , and expensive gifts .
27:11:039:0	Claiming this foreign god 's help , he will attack the strongest fortresses . He will honor those who submit to him , appointing them to positions of authority and dividing the land among them as their reward .
27:11:040:0	“ Then at the time of the end , the king of the south will attack the king of the north . The king of the north will storm out with chariots , charioteers , and a vast navy . He will invade various lands and sweep through them like a flood .
27:11:041:0	He will enter the glorious land of Israel , and many nations will fall , but Moab , Edom , and the best part of Ammon will escape .
27:11:042:0	He will conquer many countries , and even Egypt will not escape .
27:11:043:0	He will gain control over the gold , silver , and treasures of Egypt , and the Libyans and Ethiopians will be his servants .
27:11:044:0	“ But then news from the east and the north will alarm him , and he will set out in great anger to destroy and obliterate many .
27:11:045:0	He will stop between the glorious holy mountain and the sea and will pitch his royal tents . But while he is there , his time will suddenly run out , and no one will help him .
