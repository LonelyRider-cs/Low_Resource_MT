27:7:001:1	Daniel 's Vision of Four Beasts
27:7:001:0	Earlier , during the first year of King Belshazzar 's reign in Babylon , Daniel had a dream and saw visions as he lay in his bed . He wrote down the dream , and this is what he saw .
27:7:002:0	In my vision that night , I , Daniel , saw a great storm churning the surface of a great sea , with strong winds blowing from every direction .
27:7:003:0	Then four huge beasts came up out of the water , each different from the others .
27:7:004:0	The first beast was like a lion with eagles ' wings . As I watched , its wings were pulled off , and it was left standing with its two hind feet on the ground , like a human being . And it was given a human mind .
27:7:005:0	Then I saw a second beast , and it looked like a bear . It was rearing up on one side , and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . And I heard a voice saying to it , “ Get up ! Devour the flesh of many people ! ”
27:7:006:0	Then the third of these strange beasts appeared , and it looked like a leopard . It had four bird 's wings on its back , and it had four heads . Great authority was given to this beast .
27:7:007:0	Then in my vision that night , I saw a fourth beast—terrifying , dreadful , and very strong . It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled their remains beneath its feet . It was different from any of the other beasts , and it had ten horns .
27:7:008:0	As I was looking at the horns , suddenly another small horn appeared among them . Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it . This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly .
27:7:009:0	I watched as thrones were put in placeand the Ancient One sat down to judge.His clothing was as white as snow , his hair like purest wool.He sat on a fiery thronewith wheels of blazing fire ,
27:7:010:0	and a river of fire was pouring out , flowing from his presence.Millions of angels ministered to him ; many millions stood to attend him.Then the court began its session , and the books were opened .
27:7:011:0	I continued to watch because I could hear the little horn 's boastful speech . I kept watching until the fourth beast was killed and its body was destroyed by fire .
27:7:012:0	The other three beasts had their authority taken from them , but they were allowed to live a while longer .
27:7:013:0	As my vision continued that night , I saw someone like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven . He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence .
27:7:002:1	The Vision Is Explained
27:7:014:0	He was given authority , honor , and sovereignty over all the nations of the world , so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him . His rule is eternal—it will never end . His kingdom will never be destroyed .
27:7:015:0	I , Daniel , was troubled by all I had seen , and my visions terrified me .
27:7:016:0	So I approached one of those standing beside the throne and asked him what it all meant . He explained it to me like this :
27:7:017:0	“ These four huge beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the earth .
27:7:018:0	But in the end , the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom , and they will rule forever and ever . ”
27:7:019:0	Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast , the one so different from the others and so terrifying . It had devoured and crushed its victims with iron teeth and bronze claws , trampling their remains beneath its feet .
27:7:020:0	I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast 's head and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns . This horn had seemed greater than the others , and it had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly .
27:7:021:0	As I watched , this horn was waging war against God 's holy people and was defeating them ,
27:7:022:0	until the Ancient One—the Most High—came and judged in favor of his holy people . Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom .
27:7:023:0	Then he said to me , “ This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth . It will be different from all the others . It will devour the whole world , trampling and crushing everything in its path .
27:7:024:0	Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire . Then another king will arise , different from the other ten , who will subdue three of them .
27:7:025:0	He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High . He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws , and they will be placed under his control for a time , times , and half a time .
27:7:026:0	“ But then the court will pass judgment , and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed .
27:7:027:0	Then the sovereignty , power , and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High . His kingdom will last forever , and all rulers will serve and obey him . ”
27:7:028:0	That was the end of the vision . I , Daniel , was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear , but I kept these things to myself .
