27:2:001:1	Nebuchadnezzar 's Dream
27:2:001:0	One night during the second year of his reign , Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing dreams that he could n't sleep .
27:2:002:0	He called in his magicians , enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers , and he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed . As they stood before the king ,
27:2:003:0	he said , “ I have had a dream that deeply troubles me , and I must know what it means . ”
27:2:004:0	Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic , “ Long live the king ! Tell us the dream , and we will tell you what it means . ”
27:2:005:0	But the king said to the astrologers , “ I am serious about this . If you do n't tell me what my dream was and what it means , you will be torn limb from limb , and your houses will be turned into heaps of rubble !
27:2:006:0	But if you tell me what I dreamed and what the dream means , I will give you many wonderful gifts and honors . Just tell me the dream and what it means ! ”
27:2:007:0	They said again , “ Please , Your Majesty . Tell us the dream , and we will tell you what it means . ”
27:2:008:0	The king replied , “ I know what you are doing ! You 're stalling for time because you know I am serious when I say ,
27:2:009:0	‘ If you do n't tell me the dream , you are doomed . ' So you have conspired to tell me lies , hoping I will change my mind . But tell me the dream , and then I 'll know that you can tell me what it means . ”
27:2:010:0	The astrologers replied to the king , “ No one on earth can tell the king his dream ! And no king , however great and powerful , has ever asked such a thing of any magician , enchanter , or astrologer !
27:2:011:0	The king 's demand is impossible . No one except the gods can tell you your dream , and they do not live here among people . ”
27:2:012:0	The king was furious when he heard this , and he ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be executed .
27:2:013:0	And because of the king 's decree , men were sent to find and kill Daniel and his friends .
27:2:014:0	When Arioch , the commander of the king 's guard , came to kill them , Daniel handled the situation with wisdom and discretion .
27:2:015:0	He asked Arioch , “ Why has the king issued such a harsh decree ? ” So Arioch told him all that had happened .
27:2:016:0	Daniel went at once to see the king and requested more time to tell the king what the dream meant .
27:2:017:0	Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah what had happened .
27:2:018:0	He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling them the secret , so they would not be executed along with the other wise men of Babylon .
27:2:019:0	That night the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision . Then Daniel praised the God of heaven .
27:2:020:0	He said , “ Praise the name of God forever and ever , for he has all wisdom and power .
27:2:021:0	He controls the course of world events ; he removes kings and sets up other kings.He gives wisdom to the wiseand knowledge to the scholars .
27:2:022:0	He reveals deep and mysterious thingsand knows what lies hidden in darkness , though he is surrounded by light .
27:2:002:1	Daniel Interprets the Dream
27:2:023:0	I thank and praise you , God of my ancestors , for you have given me wisdom and strength.You have told me what we asked of youand revealed to us what the king demanded . ”
27:2:024:0	Then Daniel went in to see Arioch , whom the king had ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon . Daniel said to him , “ Do n't kill the wise men . Take me to the king , and I will tell him the meaning of his dream . ”
27:2:025:0	Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king and said , “ I have found one of the captives from Judah who will tell the king the meaning of his dream ! ”
27:2:026:0	The king said to Daniel ( also known as Belteshazzar ) , “ Is this true ? Can you tell me what my dream was and what it means ? ”
27:2:027:0	Daniel replied , “ There are no wise men , enchanters , magicians , or fortune-tellers who can reveal the king 's secret .
27:2:028:0	But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future . Now I will tell you your dream and the visions you saw as you lay on your bed .
27:2:029:0	“ While Your Majesty was sleeping , you dreamed about coming events . He who reveals secrets has shown you what is going to happen .
27:2:030:0	And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else that I know the secret of your dream , but because God wants you to understand what was in your heart .
27:2:031:0	“ In your vision , Your Majesty , you saw standing before you a huge , shining statue of a man . It was a frightening sight .
27:2:032:0	The head of the statue was made of fine gold . Its chest and arms were silver , its belly and thighs were bronze ,
27:2:033:0	its legs were iron , and its feet were a combination of iron and baked clay .
27:2:034:0	As you watched , a rock was cut from a mountain , but not by human hands . It struck the feet of iron and clay , smashing them to bits .
27:2:035:0	The whole statue was crushed into small pieces of iron , clay , bronze , silver , and gold . Then the wind blew them away without a trace , like chaff on a threshing floor . But the rock that knocked the statue down became a great mountain that covered the whole earth .
27:2:036:0	“ That was the dream . Now we will tell the king what it means .
27:2:037:0	Your Majesty , you are the greatest of kings . The God of heaven has given you sovereignty , power , strength , and honor .
27:2:038:0	He has made you the ruler over all the inhabited world and has put even the wild animals and birds under your control . You are the head of gold .
27:2:039:0	“ But after your kingdom comes to an end , another kingdom , inferior to yours , will rise to take your place . After that kingdom has fallen , yet a third kingdom , represented by bronze , will rise to rule the world .
27:2:040:0	Following that kingdom , there will be a fourth one , as strong as iron . That kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires , just as iron smashes and crushes everything it strikes .
27:2:041:0	The feet and toes you saw were a combination of iron and baked clay , showing that this kingdom will be divided . Like iron mixed with clay , it will have some of the strength of iron .
27:2:042:0	But while some parts of it will be as strong as iron , other parts will be as weak as clay .
27:2:043:0	This mixture of iron and clay also shows that these kingdoms will try to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage . But they will not hold together , just as iron and clay do not mix .
27:2:044:0	“ During the reigns of those kings , the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed or conquered . It will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness , and it will stand forever .
27:2:003:1	Nebuchadnezzar Rewards Daniel
27:2:045:0	That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain , though not by human hands , that crushed to pieces the statue of iron , bronze , clay , silver , and gold . The great God was showing the king what will happen in the future . The dream is true , and its meaning is certain . ”
27:2:046:0	Then King Nebuchadnezzar threw himself down before Daniel and worshiped him , and he commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense before him .
27:2:047:0	The king said to Daniel , “ Truly , your God is the greatest of gods , the Lord over kings , a revealer of mysteries , for you have been able to reveal this secret . ”
27:2:048:0	Then the king appointed Daniel to a high position and gave him many valuable gifts . He made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon , as well as chief over all his wise men .
27:2:049:0	At Daniel 's request , the king appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon , while Daniel remained in the king 's court .
