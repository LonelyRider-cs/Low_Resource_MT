27:8:001:1	Daniel 's Vision of a Ram and Goat
27:8:001:0	During the third year of King Belshazzar 's reign , I , Daniel , saw another vision , following the one that had already appeared to me .
27:8:002:0	In this vision I was at the fortress of Susa , in the province of Elam , standing beside the Ulai River .
27:8:003:0	As I looked up , I saw a ram with two long horns standing beside the river . One of the horns was longer than the other , even though it had grown later than the other one .
27:8:004:0	The ram butted everything out of his way to the west , to the north , and to the south , and no one could stand against him or help his victims . He did as he pleased and became very great .
27:8:005:0	While I was watching , suddenly a male goat appeared from the west , crossing the land so swiftly that he did n't even touch the ground . This goat , which had one very large horn between its eyes ,
27:8:006:0	headed toward the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the river , rushing at him in a rage .
27:8:007:0	The goat charged furiously at the ram and struck him , breaking off both his horns . Now the ram was helpless , and the goat knocked him down and trampled him . No one could rescue the ram from the goat 's power .
27:8:008:0	The goat became very powerful . But at the height of his power , his large horn was broken off . In the large horn 's place grew four prominent horns pointing in the four directions of the earth .
27:8:009:0	Then from one of the prominent horns came a small horn whose power grew very great . It extended toward the south and the east and toward the glorious land of Israel .
27:8:010:0	Its power reached to the heavens , where it attacked the heavenly army , throwing some of the heavenly beings and some of the stars to the ground and trampling them .
27:8:011:0	It even challenged the Commander of heaven 's army by canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him and by destroying his Temple .
27:8:012:0	The army of heaven was restrained from responding to this rebellion . So the daily sacrifice was halted , and truth was overthrown . The horn succeeded in everything it did .
27:8:013:0	Then I heard two holy ones talking to each other . One of them asked , “ How long will the events of this vision last ? How long will the rebellion that causes desecration stop the daily sacrifices ? How long will the Temple and heaven 's army be trampled on ? ”
27:8:002:1	Gabriel Explains the Vision
27:8:014:0	The other replied , “ It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings ; then the Temple will be made right again . ”
27:8:015:0	As I , Daniel , was trying to understand the meaning of this vision , someone who looked like a man stood in front of me .
27:8:016:0	And I heard a human voice calling out from the Ulai River , “ Gabriel , tell this man the meaning of his vision . ”
27:8:017:0	As Gabriel approached the place where I was standing , I became so terrified that I fell with my face to the ground . “ Son of man , ” he said , “ you must understand that the events you have seen in your vision relate to the time of the end . ”
27:8:018:0	While he was speaking , I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground . But Gabriel roused me with a touch and helped me to my feet .
27:8:019:0	Then he said , “ I am here to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath . What you have seen pertains to the very end of time .
27:8:020:0	The two-horned ram represents the kings of Media and Persia .
27:8:021:0	The shaggy male goat represents the king of Greece , and the large horn between his eyes represents the first king of the Greek Empire .
27:8:022:0	The four prominent horns that replaced the one large horn show that the Greek Empire will break into four kingdoms , but none as great as the first .
27:8:023:0	“ At the end of their rule , when their sin is at its height , a fierce king , a master of intrigue , will rise to power .
27:8:024:0	He will become very strong , but not by his own power . He will cause a shocking amount of destruction and succeed in everything he does . He will destroy powerful leaders and devastate the holy people .
27:8:025:0	He will be a master of deception and will become arrogant ; he will destroy many without warning . He will even take on the Prince of princes in battle , but he will be broken , though not by human power .
27:8:026:0	“ This vision about the 2,300 evenings and mornings is true . But none of these things will happen for a long time , so keep this vision a secret . ”
27:8:027:0	Then I , Daniel , was overcome and lay sick for several days . Afterward I got up and performed my duties for the king , but I was greatly troubled by the vision and could not understand it .
