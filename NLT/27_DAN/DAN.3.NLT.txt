27:3:001:1	Nebuchadnezzar 's Gold Statue
27:3:001:0	King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet tall and nine feet wide and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon .
27:3:002:0	Then he sent messages to the high officers , officials , governors , advisers , treasurers , judges , magistrates , and all the provincial officials to come to the dedication of the statue he had set up .
27:3:003:0	So all these officials came and stood before the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
27:3:004:0	Then a herald shouted out , “ People of all races and nations and languages , listen to the king 's command !
27:3:005:0	When you hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipes , and other musical instruments , bow to the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar 's gold statue .
27:3:006:0	Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace . ”
27:3:007:0	So at the sound of the musical instruments , all the people , whatever their race or nation or language , bowed to the ground and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
27:3:008:0	But some of the astrologers went to the king and informed on the Jews .
27:3:009:0	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar , “ Long live the king !
27:3:010:0	You issued a decree requiring all the people to bow down and worship the gold statue when they hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipes , and other musical instruments .
27:3:011:0	That decree also states that those who refuse to obey must be thrown into a blazing furnace .
27:3:012:0	But there are some Jews—Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego—whom you have put in charge of the province of Babylon . They pay no attention to you , Your Majesty . They refuse to serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up . ”
27:3:013:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and ordered that Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego be brought before him . When they were brought in ,
27:3:014:0	Nebuchadnezzar said to them , “ Is it true , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , that you refuse to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I have set up ?
27:3:015:0	I will give you one more chance to bow down and worship the statue I have made when you hear the sound of the musical instruments . But if you refuse , you will be thrown immediately into the blazing furnace . And then what god will be able to rescue you from my power ? ”
27:3:016:0	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego replied , “ O Nebuchadnezzar , we do not need to defend ourselves before you .
27:3:017:0	If we are thrown into the blazing furnace , the God whom we serve is able to save us . He will rescue us from your power , Your Majesty .
27:3:002:1	The Blazing Furnace
27:3:018:0	But even if he does n't , we want to make it clear to you , Your Majesty , that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up . ”
27:3:019:0	Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage . He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual .
27:3:020:0	Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace .
27:3:021:0	So they tied them up and threw them into the furnace , fully dressed in their pants , turbans , robes , and other garments .
27:3:022:0	And because the king , in his anger , had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace , the flames killed the soldiers as they threw the three men in .
27:3:023:0	So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , securely tied , fell into the roaring flames .
27:3:024:0	But suddenly , Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his advisers , “ Did n't we tie up three men and throw them into the furnace ? ” “ Yes , Your Majesty , we certainly did , ” they replied .
27:3:025:0	“ Look ! ” Nebuchadnezzar shouted . “ I see four men , unbound , walking around in the fire unharmed ! And the fourth looks like a god ! ”
27:3:026:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted : “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , servants of the Most High God , come out ! Come here ! ” So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego stepped out of the fire .
27:3:027:0	Then the high officers , officials , governors , and advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not touched them . Not a hair on their heads was singed , and their clothing was not scorched . They did n't even smell of smoke !
27:3:028:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar said , “ Praise to the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him . They defied the king 's command and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God .
27:3:029:0	Therefore , I make this decree : If any people , whatever their race or nation or language , speak a word against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , they will be torn limb from limb , and their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble . There is no other god who can rescue like this ! ”
27:3:030:0	Then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego to even higher positions in the province of Babylon .
