27:9:001:1	Daniel 's Prayer for His People
27:9:001:0	It was the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede , the son of Ahasuerus , who became king of the Babylonians .
27:9:002:0	During the first year of his reign , I , Daniel , learned from reading the word of the Lord , as revealed to Jeremiah the prophet , that Jerusalem must lie desolate for seventy years .
27:9:003:0	So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and fasting . I also wore rough burlap and sprinkled myself with ashes .
27:9:004:0	I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed : “ O Lord , you are a great and awesome God ! You always fulfill your covenant and keep your promises of unfailing love to those who love you and obey your commands .
27:9:005:0	But we have sinned and done wrong . We have rebelled against you and scorned your commands and regulations .
27:9:006:0	We have refused to listen to your servants the prophets , who spoke on your authority to our kings and princes and ancestors and to all the people of the land .
27:9:007:0	“ Lord , you are in the right ; but as you see , our faces are covered with shame . This is true of all of us , including the people of Judah and Jerusalem and all Israel , scattered near and far , wherever you have driven us because of our disloyalty to you .
27:9:008:0	O Lord , we and our kings , princes , and ancestors are covered with shame because we have sinned against you .
27:9:009:0	But the Lord our God is merciful and forgiving , even though we have rebelled against him .
27:9:010:0	We have not obeyed the Lord our God , for we have not followed the instructions he gave us through his servants the prophets .
27:9:011:0	All Israel has disobeyed your instruction and turned away , refusing to listen to your voice. “ So now the solemn curses and judgments written in the Law of Moses , the servant of God , have been poured down on us because of our sin .
27:9:012:0	You have kept your word and done to us and our rulers exactly as you warned . Never has there been such a disaster as happened in Jerusalem .
27:9:013:0	Every curse written against us in the Law of Moses has come true . Yet we have refused to seek mercy from the Lord our God by turning from our sins and recognizing his truth .
27:9:014:0	Therefore , the Lord has brought upon us the disaster he prepared . The Lord our God was right to do all of these things , for we did not obey him .
27:9:015:0	“ O Lord our God , you brought lasting honor to your name by rescuing your people from Egypt in a great display of power . But we have sinned and are full of wickedness .
27:9:016:0	In view of all your faithful mercies , Lord , please turn your furious anger away from your city Jerusalem , your holy mountain . All the neighboring nations mock Jerusalem and your people because of our sins and the sins of our ancestors .
27:9:017:0	“ O our God , hear your servant 's prayer ! Listen as I plead . For your own sake , Lord , smile again on your desolate sanctuary .
27:9:018:0	“ O my God , lean down and listen to me . Open your eyes and see our despair . See how your city—the city that bears your name—lies in ruins . We make this plea , not because we deserve help , but because of your mercy .
27:9:002:1	Gabriel 's Message about the Anointed One
27:9:019:0	“ O Lord , hear . O Lord , forgive . O Lord , listen and act ! For your own sake , do not delay , O my God , for your people and your city bear your name . ”
27:9:020:0	I went on praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people , pleading with the Lord my God for Jerusalem , his holy mountain .
27:9:021:0	As I was praying , Gabriel , whom I had seen in the earlier vision , came swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice .
27:9:022:0	He explained to me , “ Daniel , I have come here to give you insight and understanding .
27:9:023:0	The moment you began praying , a command was given . And now I am here to tell you what it was , for you are very precious to God . Listen carefully so that you can understand the meaning of your vision .
27:9:024:0	“ A period of seventy sets of seven has been decreed for your people and your holy city to finish their rebellion , to put an end to their sin , to atone for their guilt , to bring in everlasting righteousness , to confirm the prophetic vision , and to anoint the Most Holy Place .
27:9:025:0	Now listen and understand ! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of seven will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until a ruler—the Anointed One—comes . Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses , despite the perilous times .
27:9:026:0	“ After this period of sixty-two sets of seven , the Anointed One will be killed , appearing to have accomplished nothing , and a ruler will arise whose armies will destroy the city and the Temple . The end will come with a flood , and war and its miseries are decreed from that time to the very end .
27:9:027:0	The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of seven , but after half this time , he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings . And as a climax to all his terrible deeds , he will set up a sacrilegious object that causes desecration , until the fate decreed for this defiler is finally poured out on him . ”
