27:5:001:1	The Writing on the Wall
27:5:001:0	Many years later King Belshazzar gave a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles , and he drank wine with them .
27:5:002:0	While Belshazzar was drinking the wine , he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups that his predecessor , Nebuchadnezzar , had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem . He wanted to drink from them with his nobles , his wives , and his concubines .
27:5:003:0	So they brought these gold cups taken from the Temple , the house of God in Jerusalem , and the king and his nobles , his wives , and his concubines drank from them .
27:5:004:0	While they drank from them they praised their idols made of gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone .
27:5:005:0	Suddenly , they saw the fingers of a human hand writing on the plaster wall of the king 's palace , near the lampstand . The king himself saw the hand as it wrote ,
27:5:006:0	and his face turned pale with fright . His knees knocked together in fear and his legs gave way beneath him .
27:5:007:0	The king shouted for the enchanters , astrologers , and fortune-tellers to be brought before him . He said to these wise men of Babylon , “ Whoever can read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed in purple robes of royal honor and will have a gold chain placed around his neck . He will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom ! ”
27:5:008:0	But when all the king 's wise men had come in , none of them could read the writing or tell him what it meant .
27:5:009:0	So the king grew even more alarmed , and his face turned pale . His nobles , too , were shaken .
27:5:010:0	But when the queen mother heard what was happening , she hurried to the banquet hall . She said to Belshazzar , “ Long live the king ! Do n't be so pale and frightened .
27:5:011:0	There is a man in your kingdom who has within him the spirit of the holy gods . During Nebuchadnezzar 's reign , this man was found to have insight , understanding , and wisdom like that of the gods . Your predecessor , the king — your predecessor King Nebuchadnezzar — made him chief over all the magicians , enchanters , astrologers , and fortune-tellers of Babylon .
27:5:002:1	Daniel Explains the Writing
27:5:012:0	This man Daniel , whom the king named Belteshazzar , has exceptional ability and is filled with divine knowledge and understanding . He can interpret dreams , explain riddles , and solve difficult problems . Call for Daniel , and he will tell you what the writing means . ”
27:5:013:0	So Daniel was brought in before the king . The king asked him , “ Are you Daniel , one of the exiles brought from Judah by my predecessor , King Nebuchadnezzar ?
27:5:014:0	I have heard that you have the spirit of the gods within you and that you are filled with insight , understanding , and wisdom .
27:5:015:0	My wise men and enchanters have tried to read the words on the wall and tell me their meaning , but they can not do it .
27:5:016:0	I am told that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems . If you can read these words and tell me their meaning , you will be clothed in purple robes of royal honor , and you will have a gold chain placed around your neck . You will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom . ”
27:5:017:0	Daniel answered the king , “ Keep your gifts or give them to someone else , but I will tell you what the writing means .
27:5:018:0	Your Majesty , the Most High God gave sovereignty , majesty , glory , and honor to your predecessor , Nebuchadnezzar .
27:5:019:0	He made him so great that people of all races and nations and languages trembled before him in fear . He killed those he wanted to kill and spared those he wanted to spare . He honored those he wanted to honor and disgraced those he wanted to disgrace .
27:5:020:0	But when his heart and mind were puffed up with arrogance , he was brought down from his royal throne and stripped of his glory .
27:5:021:0	He was driven from human society . He was given the mind of a wild animal , and he lived among the wild donkeys . He ate grass like a cow , and he was drenched with the dew of heaven , until he learned that the Most High God rules over the kingdoms of the world and appoints anyone he desires to rule over them .
27:5:022:0	“ You are his successor , O Belshazzar , and you knew all this , yet you have not humbled yourself .
27:5:023:0	For you have proudly defied the Lord of heaven and have had these cups from his Temple brought before you . You and your nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver , gold , bronze , iron , wood , and stone — gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all . But you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny !
27:5:024:0	So God has sent this hand to write this message .
27:5:025:0	“ This is the message that was written : Mene , Mene , Tekel , and Parsin .
27:5:026:0	This is what these words mean : Mene means ‘ numbered ' — God has numbered the days of your reign and has brought it to an end .
27:5:027:0	Tekel means ‘ weighed ' — you have been weighed on the balances and have not measured up .
27:5:028:0	Parsin means ‘ divided ' — your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians . ”
27:5:029:0	Then at Belshazzar 's command , Daniel was dressed in purple robes , a gold chain was hung around his neck , and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom .
27:5:030:0	That very night Belshazzar , the Babylonian king , was killed .
27:5:031:0	And Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of sixty-two .
