63:1:001:1	Greetings
63:1:001:0	This letter is from John , the elder.I am writing to the chosen lady and to her children , whom I love in the truth—as does everyone else who knows the truth—
63:1:002:0	because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever .
63:1:002:1	Live in the Truth
63:1:003:0	Grace , mercy , and peace , which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ—the Son of the Father—will continue to be with us who live in truth and love .
63:1:004:0	How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth , just as the Father commanded .
63:1:005:0	I am writing to remind you , dear friends , that we should love one another . This is not a new commandment , but one we have had from the beginning .
63:1:006:0	Love means doing what God has commanded us , and he has commanded us to love one another , just as you heard from the beginning .
63:1:007:0	I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world . They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body . Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist .
63:1:008:0	Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked so hard to achieve . Be diligent so that you receive your full reward .
63:1:009:0	Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God . But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son .
63:1:010:0	If anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ , do n't invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement .
63:1:003:1	Conclusion
63:1:011:0	Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work .
63:1:012:0	I have much more to say to you , but I do n't want to do it with paper and ink . For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face . Then our joy will be complete .
63:1:013:0	Greetings from the children of your sister , chosen by God .
