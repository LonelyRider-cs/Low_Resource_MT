44:22:001:0	“ Brothers and esteemed fathers , ” Paul said , “ listen to me as I offer my defense . ”
44:22:002:0	When they heard him speaking in their own language , the silence was even greater .
44:22:003:0	Then Paul said , “ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , and I was brought up and educated here in Jerusalem under Gamaliel . As his student , I was carefully trained in our Jewish laws and customs . I became very zealous to honor God in everything I did , just like all of you today .
44:22:004:0	And I persecuted the followers of the Way , hounding some to death , arresting both men and women and throwing them in prison .
44:22:005:0	The high priest and the whole council of elders can testify that this is so . For I received letters from them to our Jewish brothers in Damascus , authorizing me to bring the followers of the Way from there to Jerusalem , in chains , to be punished .
44:22:006:0	“ As I was on the road , approaching Damascus about noon , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shone down around me .
44:22:007:0	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '
44:22:008:0	“ ‘ Who are you , lord ? ' I asked. “ And the voice replied , ‘ I am Jesus the Nazarene , the one you are persecuting . '
44:22:009:0	The people with me saw the light but did n't understand the voice speaking to me .
44:22:010:0	“ I asked , ‘ What should I do , Lord ? ' “ And the Lord told me , ‘ Get up and go into Damascus , and there you will be told everything you are to do . '
44:22:011:0	“ I was blinded by the intense light and had to be led by the hand to Damascus by my companions .
44:22:012:0	A man named Ananias lived there . He was a godly man , deeply devoted to the law , and well regarded by all the Jews of Damascus .
44:22:013:0	He came and stood beside me and said , ‘ Brother Saul , regain your sight . ' And that very moment I could see him !
44:22:014:0	“ Then he told me , ‘ The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and hear him speak .
44:22:015:0	For you are to be his witness , telling everyone what you have seen and heard .
44:22:016:0	What are you waiting for ? Get up and be baptized . Have your sins washed away by calling on the name of the Lord . '
44:22:017:0	“ After I returned to Jerusalem , I was praying in the Temple and fell into a trance .
44:22:018:0	I saw a vision of Jesus saying to me , ‘ Hurry ! Leave Jerusalem , for the people here wo n't accept your testimony about me . '
44:22:019:0	“ ‘ But Lord , ' I argued , ‘ they certainly know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you .
44:22:020:0	And I was in complete agreement when your witness Stephen was killed . I stood by and kept the coats they took off when they stoned him . '
44:22:021:0	“ But the Lord said to me , ‘ Go , for I will send you far away to the Gentiles ! ' ”
44:22:022:0	The crowd listened until Paul said that word . Then they all began to shout , “ Away with such a fellow ! He is n't fit to live ! ”
44:22:001:1	Paul Reveals His Roman Citizenship
44:22:023:0	They yelled , threw off their coats , and tossed handfuls of dust into the air .
44:22:024:0	The commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime . He wanted to find out why the crowd had become so furious .
44:22:025:0	When they tied Paul down to lash him , Paul said to the officer standing there , “ Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who has n't even been tried ? ”
44:22:026:0	When the officer heard this , he went to the commander and asked , “ What are you doing ? This man is a Roman citizen ! ”
44:22:027:0	So the commander went over and asked Paul , “ Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? ” “ Yes , I certainly am , ” Paul replied .
44:22:028:0	“ I am , too , ” the commander muttered , “ and it cost me plenty ! ” Paul answered , “ But I am a citizen by birth ! ”
44:22:002:1	Paul before the High Council
44:22:029:0	The soldiers who were about to interrogate Paul quickly withdrew when they heard he was a Roman citizen , and the commander was frightened because he had ordered him bound and whipped .
44:22:030:0	The next day the commander ordered the leading priests into session with the Jewish high council . He wanted to find out what the trouble was all about , so he released Paul to have him stand before them .
