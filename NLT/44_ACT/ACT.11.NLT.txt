44:11:001:1	Peter Explains His Actions
44:11:001:0	Soon the news reached the apostles and other believers in Judea that the Gentiles had received the word of God .
44:11:002:0	But when Peter arrived back in Jerusalem , the Jewish believers criticized him .
44:11:003:0	“ You entered the home of Gentiles and even ate with them ! ” they said .
44:11:004:0	Then Peter told them exactly what had happened .
44:11:005:0	“ I was in the town of Joppa , ” he said , “ and while I was praying , I went into a trance and saw a vision . Something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners from the sky . And it came right down to me .
44:11:006:0	When I looked inside the sheet , I saw all sorts of tame and wild animals , reptiles , and birds .
44:11:007:0	And I heard a voice say , ‘ Get up , Peter ; kill and eat them . '
44:11:008:0	“ ‘ No , Lord , ' I replied . ‘ I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure or unclean . '
44:11:009:0	“ But the voice from heaven spoke again : ‘ Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean . '
44:11:010:0	This happened three times before the sheet and all it contained was pulled back up to heaven .
44:11:011:0	“ Just then three men who had been sent from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were staying .
44:11:012:0	The Holy Spirit told me to go with them and not to worry that they were Gentiles . These six brothers here accompanied me , and we soon entered the home of the man who had sent for us .
44:11:013:0	He told us how an angel had appeared to him in his home and had told him , ‘ Send messengers to Joppa , and summon a man named Simon Peter .
44:11:014:0	He will tell you how you and everyone in your household can be saved ! '
44:11:015:0	“ As I began to speak , ” Peter continued , “ the Holy Spirit fell on them , just as he fell on us at the beginning .
44:11:016:0	Then I thought of the Lord 's words when he said , ‘ John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . '
44:11:017:0	And since God gave these Gentiles the same gift he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I to stand in God 's way ? ”
44:11:002:1	The Church in Antioch of Syria
44:11:018:0	When the others heard this , they stopped objecting and began praising God . They said , “ We can see that God has also given the Gentiles the privilege of repenting of their sins and receiving eternal life . ”
44:11:019:0	Meanwhile , the believers who had been scattered during the persecution after Stephen 's death traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch of Syria . They preached the word of God , but only to Jews .
44:11:020:0	However , some of the believers who went to Antioch from Cyprus and Cyrene began preaching to the Gentiles about the Lord Jesus .
44:11:021:0	The power of the Lord was with them , and a large number of these Gentiles believed and turned to the Lord .
44:11:022:0	When the church at Jerusalem heard what had happened , they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44:11:023:0	When he arrived and saw this evidence of God 's blessing , he was filled with joy , and he encouraged the believers to stay true to the Lord .
44:11:024:0	Barnabas was a good man , full of the Holy Spirit and strong in faith . And many people were brought to the Lord .
44:11:025:0	Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul .
44:11:026:0	When he found him , he brought him back to Antioch . Both of them stayed there with the church for a full year , teaching large crowds of people . ( It was at Antioch that the believers were first called Christians . )
44:11:027:0	During this time some prophets traveled from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44:11:028:0	One of them named Agabus stood up in one of the meetings and predicted by the Spirit that a great famine was coming upon the entire Roman world . ( This was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius . )
44:11:029:0	So the believers in Antioch decided to send relief to the brothers and sisters in Judea , everyone giving as much as they could .
44:11:030:0	This they did , entrusting their gifts to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem .
