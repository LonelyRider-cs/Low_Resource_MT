44:12:001:0	About that time King Herod Agrippa began to persecute some believers in the church .
44:12:002:0	He had the apostle James ( John 's brother ) killed with a sword .
44:12:003:0	When Herod saw how much this pleased the Jewish people , he also arrested Peter . ( This took place during the Passover celebration . )
44:12:004:0	Then he imprisoned him , placing him under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each . Herod intended to bring Peter out for public trial after the Passover .
44:12:002:1	Peter 's Miraculous Escape from Prison
44:12:005:0	But while Peter was in prison , the church prayed very earnestly for him .
44:12:006:0	The night before Peter was to be placed on trial , he was asleep , fastened with two chains between two soldiers . Others stood guard at the prison gate .
44:12:007:0	Suddenly , there was a bright light in the cell , and an angel of the Lord stood before Peter . The angel struck him on the side to awaken him and said , “ Quick ! Get up ! ” And the chains fell off his wrists .
44:12:008:0	Then the angel told him , “ Get dressed and put on your sandals. ” And he did . “ Now put on your coat and follow me , ” the angel ordered .
44:12:009:0	So Peter left the cell , following the angel . But all the time he thought it was a vision . He did n't realize it was actually happening .
44:12:010:0	They passed the first and second guard posts and came to the iron gate leading to the city , and this opened for them all by itself . So they passed through and started walking down the street , and then the angel suddenly left him .
44:12:011:0	Peter finally came to his senses . “ It 's really true ! ” he said . “ The Lord has sent his angel and saved me from Herod and from what the Jewish leaders had planned to do to me ! ”
44:12:012:0	When he realized this , he went to the home of Mary , the mother of John Mark , where many were gathered for prayer .
44:12:013:0	He knocked at the door in the gate , and a servant girl named Rhoda came to open it .
44:12:014:0	When she recognized Peter 's voice , she was so overjoyed that , instead of opening the door , she ran back inside and told everyone , “ Peter is standing at the door ! ”
44:12:015:0	“ You 're out of your mind ! ” they said . When she insisted , they decided , “ It must be his angel . ”
44:12:016:0	Meanwhile , Peter continued knocking . When they finally opened the door and saw him , they were amazed .
44:12:017:0	He motioned for them to quiet down and told them how the Lord had led him out of prison . “ Tell James and the other brothers what happened , ” he said . And then he went to another place .
44:12:018:0	At dawn there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter .
44:12:003:1	The Death of Herod Agrippa
44:12:019:0	Herod Agrippa ordered a thorough search for him . When he could n't be found , Herod interrogated the guards and sentenced them to death . Afterward Herod left Judea to stay in Caesarea for a while .
44:12:020:0	Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon . So they sent a delegation to make peace with him because their cities were dependent upon Herod 's country for food . The delegates won the support of Blastus , Herod 's personal assistant ,
44:12:021:0	and an appointment with Herod was granted . When the day arrived , Herod put on his royal robes , sat on his throne , and made a speech to them .
44:12:022:0	The people gave him a great ovation , shouting , “ It 's the voice of a god , not of a man ! ”
44:12:023:0	Instantly , an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness , because he accepted the people 's worship instead of giving the glory to God . So he was consumed with worms and died .
44:12:024:0	Meanwhile , the word of God continued to spread , and there were many new believers .
44:12:025:0	When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission to Jerusalem , they returned , taking John Mark with them .
