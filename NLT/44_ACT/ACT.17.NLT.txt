44:17:001:1	Paul Preaches in Thessalonica
44:17:001:0	Paul and Silas then traveled through the towns of Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
44:17:002:0	As was Paul 's custom , he went to the synagogue service , and for three Sabbaths in a row he used the Scriptures to reason with the people .
44:17:003:0	He explained the prophecies and proved that the Messiah must suffer and rise from the dead . He said , “ This Jesus I 'm telling you about is the Messiah . ”
44:17:004:0	Some of the Jews who listened were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas , along with many God-fearing Greek men and quite a few prominent women .
44:17:005:0	But some of the Jews were jealous , so they gathered some troublemakers from the marketplace to form a mob and start a riot . They attacked the home of Jason , searching for Paul and Silas so they could drag them out to the crowd .
44:17:006:0	Not finding them there , they dragged out Jason and some of the other believers instead and took them before the city council . “ Paul and Silas have caused trouble all over the world , ” they shouted , “ and now they are here disturbing our city , too .
44:17:007:0	And Jason has welcomed them into his home . They are all guilty of treason against Caesar , for they profess allegiance to another king , named Jesus . ”
44:17:008:0	The people of the city , as well as the city council , were thrown into turmoil by these reports .
44:17:002:1	Paul and Silas in Berea
44:17:009:0	So the officials forced Jason and the other believers to post bond , and then they released them .
44:17:010:0	That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea . When they arrived there , they went to the Jewish synagogue .
44:17:011:0	And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica , and they listened eagerly to Paul 's message . They searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas were teaching the truth .
44:17:012:0	As a result , many Jews believed , as did many of the prominent Greek women and men .
44:17:013:0	But when some Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea , they went there and stirred up trouble .
44:17:014:0	The believers acted at once , sending Paul on to the coast , while Silas and Timothy remained behind .
44:17:003:1	Paul Preaches in Athens
44:17:015:0	Those escorting Paul went with him all the way to Athens ; then they returned to Berea with instructions for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him .
44:17:016:0	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens , he was deeply troubled by all the idols he saw everywhere in the city .
44:17:017:0	He went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles , and he spoke daily in the public square to all who happened to be there .
44:17:018:0	He also had a debate with some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers . When he told them about Jesus and his resurrection , they said , “ What 's this babbler trying to say with these strange ideas he 's picked up ? ” Others said , “ He seems to be preaching about some foreign gods . ”
44:17:019:0	Then they took him to the high council of the city . “ Come and tell us about this new teaching , ” they said .
44:17:020:0	“ You are saying some rather strange things , and we want to know what it 's all about . ”
44:17:021:0	( It should be explained that all the Athenians as well as the foreigners in Athens seemed to spend all their time discussing the latest ideas . )
44:17:022:0	So Paul , standing before the council , addressed them as follows : “ Men of Athens , I notice that you are very religious in every way ,
44:17:023:0	for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines . And one of your altars had this inscription on it : ‘ To an Unknown God . ' This God , whom you worship without knowing , is the one I 'm telling you about .
44:17:024:0	“ He is the God who made the world and everything in it . Since he is Lord of heaven and earth , he does n't live in man-made temples ,
44:17:025:0	and human hands ca n't serve his needs—for he has no needs . He himself gives life and breath to everything , and he satisfies every need .
44:17:026:0	From one man he created all the nations throughout the whole earth . He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall , and he determined their boundaries .
44:17:027:0	“ His purpose was for the nations to seek after God and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him—though he is not far from any one of us .
44:17:028:0	For in him we live and move and exist . As some of your own poets have said , ‘ We are his offspring . '
44:17:029:0	And since this is true , we should n't think of God as an idol designed by craftsmen from gold or silver or stone .
44:17:030:0	“ God overlooked people 's ignorance about these things in earlier times , but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him .
44:17:031:0	For he has set a day for judging the world with justice by the man he has appointed , and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead . ”
44:17:032:0	When they heard Paul speak about the resurrection of the dead , some laughed in contempt , but others said , “ We want to hear more about this later . ”
44:17:033:0	That ended Paul 's discussion with them ,
44:17:034:0	but some joined him and became believers . Among them were Dionysius , a member of the council , a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
