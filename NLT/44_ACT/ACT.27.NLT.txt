44:27:001:1	Paul Sails for Rome
44:27:001:0	When the time came , we set sail for Italy . Paul and several other prisoners were placed in the custody of a Roman officer named Julius , a captain of the Imperial Regiment .
44:27:002:0	Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica , was also with us . We left on a ship whose home port was Adramyttium on the northwest coast of the province of Asia ; it was scheduled to make several stops at ports along the coast of the province .
44:27:003:0	The next day when we docked at Sidon , Julius was very kind to Paul and let him go ashore to visit with friends so they could provide for his needs .
44:27:004:0	Putting out to sea from there , we encountered strong headwinds that made it difficult to keep the ship on course , so we sailed north of Cyprus between the island and the mainland .
44:27:005:0	Keeping to the open sea , we passed along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , landing at Myra , in the province of Lycia .
44:27:006:0	There the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy , and he put us on board .
44:27:007:0	We had several days of slow sailing , and after great difficulty we finally neared Cnidus . But the wind was against us , so we sailed across to Crete and along the sheltered coast of the island , past the cape of Salmone .
44:27:008:0	We struggled along the coast with great difficulty and finally arrived at Fair Havens , near the town of Lasea .
44:27:009:0	We had lost a lot of time . The weather was becoming dangerous for sea travel because it was so late in the fall , and Paul spoke to the ship 's officers about it .
44:27:010:0	“ Men , ” he said , “ I believe there is trouble ahead if we go on—shipwreck , loss of cargo , and danger to our lives as well . ”
44:27:011:0	But the officer in charge of the prisoners listened more to the ship 's captain and the owner than to Paul .
44:27:002:1	The Storm at Sea
44:27:012:0	And since Fair Havens was an exposed harbor—a poor place to spend the winter—most of the crew wanted to go on to Phoenix , farther up the coast of Crete , and spend the winter there . Phoenix was a good harbor with only a southwest and northwest exposure .
44:27:013:0	When a light wind began blowing from the south , the sailors thought they could make it . So they pulled up anchor and sailed close to the shore of Crete .
44:27:014:0	But the weather changed abruptly , and a wind of typhoon strength ( called a “ northeaster ” ) burst across the island and blew us out to sea .
44:27:015:0	The sailors could n't turn the ship into the wind , so they gave up and let it run before the gale .
44:27:016:0	We sailed along the sheltered side of a small island named Cauda , where with great difficulty we hoisted aboard the lifeboat being towed behind us .
44:27:017:0	Then the sailors bound ropes around the hull of the ship to strengthen it . They were afraid of being driven across to the sandbars of Syrtis off the African coast , so they lowered the sea anchor to slow the ship and were driven before the wind .
44:27:018:0	The next day , as gale-force winds continued to batter the ship , the crew began throwing the cargo overboard .
44:27:019:0	The following day they even took some of the ship 's gear and threw it overboard .
44:27:020:0	The terrible storm raged for many days , blotting out the sun and the stars , until at last all hope was gone .
44:27:021:0	No one had eaten for a long time . Finally , Paul called the crew together and said , “ Men , you should have listened to me in the first place and not left Crete . You would have avoided all this damage and loss .
44:27:022:0	But take courage ! None of you will lose your lives , even though the ship will go down .
44:27:023:0	For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me ,
44:27:024:0	and he said , ‘ Do n't be afraid , Paul , for you will surely stand trial before Caesar ! What 's more , God in his goodness has granted safety to everyone sailing with you . '
44:27:025:0	So take courage ! For I believe God . It will be just as he said .
44:27:003:1	The Shipwreck
44:27:026:0	But we will be shipwrecked on an island . ”
44:27:027:0	About midnight on the fourteenth night of the storm , as we were being driven across the Sea of Adria , the sailors sensed land was near .
44:27:028:0	They dropped a weighted line and found that the water was 120 feet deep . But a little later they measured again and found it was only 90 feet deep .
44:27:029:0	At this rate they were afraid we would soon be driven against the rocks along the shore , so they threw out four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for daylight .
44:27:030:0	Then the sailors tried to abandon the ship ; they lowered the lifeboat as though they were going to put out anchors from the front of the ship .
44:27:031:0	But Paul said to the commanding officer and the soldiers , “ You will all die unless the sailors stay aboard . ”
44:27:032:0	So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away .
44:27:033:0	Just as day was dawning , Paul urged everyone to eat . “ You have been so worried that you have n't touched food for two weeks , ” he said .
44:27:034:0	“ Please eat something now for your own good . For not a hair of your heads will perish . ”
44:27:035:0	Then he took some bread , gave thanks to God before them all , and broke off a piece and ate it .
44:27:036:0	Then everyone was encouraged and began to eat—
44:27:037:0	all 276 of us who were on board .
44:27:038:0	After eating , the crew lightened the ship further by throwing the cargo of wheat overboard .
44:27:039:0	When morning dawned , they did n't recognize the coastline , but they saw a bay with a beach and wondered if they could get to shore by running the ship aground .
44:27:040:0	So they cut off the anchors and left them in the sea . Then they lowered the rudders , raised the foresail , and headed toward shore .
44:27:041:0	But they hit a shoal and ran the ship aground too soon . The bow of the ship stuck fast , while the stern was repeatedly smashed by the force of the waves and began to break apart .
44:27:042:0	The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners to make sure they did n't swim ashore and escape .
44:27:043:0	But the commanding officer wanted to spare Paul , so he did n't let them carry out their plan . Then he ordered all who could swim to jump overboard first and make for land .
44:27:044:0	The others held on to planks or debris from the broken ship . So everyone escaped safely to shore .
