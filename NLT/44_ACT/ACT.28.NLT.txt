44:28:001:1	Paul on the Island of Malta
44:28:001:0	Once we were safe on shore , we learned that we were on the island of Malta .
44:28:002:0	The people of the island were very kind to us . It was cold and rainy , so they built a fire on the shore to welcome us .
44:28:003:0	As Paul gathered an armful of sticks and was laying them on the fire , a poisonous snake , driven out by the heat , bit him on the hand .
44:28:004:0	The people of the island saw it hanging from his hand and said to each other , “ A murderer , no doubt ! Though he escaped the sea , justice will not permit him to live . ”
44:28:005:0	But Paul shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed .
44:28:006:0	The people waited for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead . But when they had waited a long time and saw that he was n't harmed , they changed their minds and decided he was a god .
44:28:007:0	Near the shore where we landed was an estate belonging to Publius , the chief official of the island . He welcomed us and treated us kindly for three days .
44:28:008:0	As it happened , Publius 's father was ill with fever and dysentery . Paul went in and prayed for him , and laying his hands on him , he healed him .
44:28:009:0	Then all the other sick people on the island came and were healed .
44:28:002:1	Paul Arrives at Rome
44:28:010:0	As a result we were showered with honors , and when the time came to sail , people supplied us with everything we would need for the trip .
44:28:011:0	It was three months after the shipwreck that we set sail on another ship that had wintered at the island—an Alexandrian ship with the twin gods as its figurehead .
44:28:012:0	Our first stop was Syracuse , where we stayed three days .
44:28:013:0	From there we sailed across to Rhegium . A day later a south wind began blowing , so the following day we sailed up the coast to Puteoli .
44:28:014:0	There we found some believers , who invited us to spend a week with them . And so we came to Rome .
44:28:015:0	The brothers and sisters in Rome had heard we were coming , and they came to meet us at the Forum on the Appian Way . Others joined us at The Three Taverns . When Paul saw them , he was encouraged and thanked God .
44:28:003:1	Paul Preaches at Rome under Guard
44:28:016:0	When we arrived in Rome , Paul was permitted to have his own private lodging , though he was guarded by a soldier .
44:28:017:0	Three days after Paul 's arrival , he called together the local Jewish leaders . He said to them , “ Brothers , I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Roman government , even though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors .
44:28:018:0	The Romans tried me and wanted to release me , because they found no cause for the death sentence .
44:28:019:0	But when the Jewish leaders protested the decision , I felt it necessary to appeal to Caesar , even though I had no desire to press charges against my own people .
44:28:020:0	I asked you to come here today so we could get acquainted and so I could explain to you that I am bound with this chain because I believe that the hope of Israel—the Messiah—has already come . ”
44:28:021:0	They replied , “ We have had no letters from Judea or reports against you from anyone who has come here .
44:28:022:0	But we want to hear what you believe , for the only thing we know about this movement is that it is denounced everywhere . ”
44:28:023:0	So a time was set , and on that day a large number of people came to Paul 's lodging . He explained and testified about the Kingdom of God and tried to persuade them about Jesus from the Scriptures . Using the law of Moses and the books of the prophets , he spoke to them from morning until evening .
44:28:024:0	Some were persuaded by the things he said , but others did not believe .
44:28:025:0	And after they had argued back and forth among themselves , they left with this final word from Paul : “ The Holy Spirit was right when he said to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet ,
44:28:026:0	‘ Go and say to this people : When you hear what I say , you will not understand.When you see what I do , you will not comprehend .
44:28:027:0	For the hearts of these people are hardened , and their ears can not hear , and they have closed their eyes—so their eyes can not see , and their ears can not hear , and their hearts can not understand , and they can not turn to meand let me heal them . '
44:28:028:0	So I want you to know that this salvation from God has also been offered to the Gentiles , and they will accept it . ”
44:28:030:0	For the next two years , Paul lived in Rome at his own expense . He welcomed all who visited him ,
44:28:031:0	boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ . And no one tried to stop him .
