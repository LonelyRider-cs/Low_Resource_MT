44:5:001:1	Ananias and Sapphira
44:5:001:0	But there was a certain man named Ananias who , with his wife , Sapphira , sold some property .
44:5:002:0	He brought part of the money to the apostles , claiming it was the full amount . With his wife 's consent , he kept the rest .
44:5:003:0	Then Peter said , “ Ananias , why have you let Satan fill your heart ? You lied to the Holy Spirit , and you kept some of the money for yourself .
44:5:004:0	The property was yours to sell or not sell , as you wished . And after selling it , the money was also yours to give away . How could you do a thing like this ? You were n't lying to us but to God ! ”
44:5:005:0	As soon as Ananias heard these words , he fell to the floor and died . Everyone who heard about it was terrified .
44:5:006:0	Then some young men got up , wrapped him in a sheet , and took him out and buried him .
44:5:007:0	About three hours later his wife came in , not knowing what had happened .
44:5:008:0	Peter asked her , “ Was this the price you and your husband received for your land ? ” “ Yes , ” she replied , “ that was the price . ”
44:5:009:0	And Peter said , “ How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this ? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door , and they will carry you out , too . ”
44:5:010:0	Instantly , she fell to the floor and died . When the young men came in and saw that she was dead , they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44:5:002:1	The Apostles Heal Many
44:5:011:0	Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened .
44:5:012:0	The apostles were performing many miraculous signs and wonders among the people . And all the believers were meeting regularly at the Temple in the area known as Solomon 's Colonnade .
44:5:013:0	But no one else dared to join them , even though all the people had high regard for them .
44:5:014:0	Yet more and more people believed and were brought to the Lord — crowds of both men and women .
44:5:015:0	As a result of the apostles ' work , sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that Peter 's shadow might fall across some of them as he went by .
44:5:003:1	The Apostles Meet Opposition
44:5:016:0	Crowds came from the villages around Jerusalem , bringing their sick and those possessed by evil spirits , and they were all healed .
44:5:017:0	The high priest and his officials , who were Sadducees , were filled with jealousy .
44:5:018:0	They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail .
44:5:019:0	But an angel of the Lord came at night , opened the gates of the jail , and brought them out . Then he told them ,
44:5:020:0	“ Go to the Temple and give the people this message of life ! ”
44:5:021:0	So at daybreak the apostles entered the Temple , as they were told , and immediately began teaching.When the high priest and his officials arrived , they convened the high council — the full assembly of the elders of Israel . Then they sent for the apostles to be brought from the jail for trial .
44:5:022:0	But when the Temple guards went to the jail , the men were gone . So they returned to the council and reported ,
44:5:023:0	“ The jail was securely locked , with the guards standing outside , but when we opened the gates , no one was there ! ”
44:5:024:0	When the captain of the Temple guard and the leading priests heard this , they were perplexed , wondering where it would all end .
44:5:025:0	Then someone arrived with startling news : “ The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple , teaching the people ! ”
44:5:026:0	The captain went with his Temple guards and arrested the apostles , but without violence , for they were afraid the people would stone them .
44:5:027:0	Then they brought the apostles before the high council , where the high priest confronted them .
44:5:028:0	“ We gave you strict orders never again to teach in this man 's name ! ” he said . “ Instead , you have filled all Jerusalem with your teaching about him , and you want to make us responsible for his death ! ”
44:5:029:0	But Peter and the apostles replied , “ We must obey God rather than any human authority .
44:5:030:0	The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead after you killed him by hanging him on a cross .
44:5:031:0	Then God put him in the place of honor at his right hand as Prince and Savior . He did this so the people of Israel would repent of their sins and be forgiven .
44:5:032:0	We are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit , who is given by God to those who obey him . ”
44:5:033:0	When they heard this , the high council was furious and decided to kill them .
44:5:034:0	But one member , a Pharisee named Gamaliel , who was an expert in religious law and respected by all the people , stood up and ordered that the men be sent outside the council chamber for a while .
44:5:035:0	Then he said to his colleagues , “ Men of Israel , take care what you are planning to do to these men !
44:5:036:0	Some time ago there was that fellow Theudas , who pretended to be someone great . About 400 others joined him , but he was killed , and all his followers went their various ways . The whole movement came to nothing .
44:5:037:0	After him , at the time of the census , there was Judas of Galilee . He got people to follow him , but he was killed , too , and all his followers were scattered .
44:5:038:0	“ So my advice is , leave these men alone . Let them go . If they are planning and doing these things merely on their own , it will soon be overthrown .
44:5:039:0	But if it is from God , you will not be able to overthrow them . You may even find yourselves fighting against God ! ”
44:5:040:0	The others accepted his advice . They called in the apostles and had them flogged . Then they ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus , and they let them go .
44:5:041:0	The apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus .
44:5:042:0	And every day , in the Temple and from house to house , they continued to teach and preach this message : “ Jesus is the Messiah . ”
