44:1:001:1	The Promise of the Holy Spirit
44:1:001:0	In my first book I told you , Theophilus , about everything Jesus began to do and teach
44:1:002:0	until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving his chosen apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit .
44:1:003:0	During the forty days after he suffered and died , he appeared to the apostles from time to time , and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive . And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God .
44:1:004:0	Once when he was eating with them , he commanded them , “ Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised , as I told you before .
44:1:002:1	The Ascension of Jesus
44:1:005:0	John baptized with water , but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ”
44:1:006:0	So when the apostles were with Jesus , they kept asking him , “ Lord , has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom ? ”
44:1:007:0	He replied , “ The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times , and they are not for you to know .
44:1:008:0	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you . And you will be my witnesses , telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem , throughout Judea , in Samaria , and to the ends of the earth . ”
44:1:009:0	After saying this , he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching , and they could no longer see him .
44:1:010:0	As they strained to see him rising into heaven , two white-robed men suddenly stood among them .
44:1:003:1	Matthias Replaces Judas
44:1:011:0	“ Men of Galilee , ” they said , “ why are you standing here staring into heaven ? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven , but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go ! ”
44:1:012:0	Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives , a distance of half a mile .
44:1:013:0	When they arrived , they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were staying.Here are the names of those who were present : Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew , Matthew , James ( son of Alphaeus ) , Simon ( the zealot ) , and Judas ( son of James ) .
44:1:014:0	They all met together and were constantly united in prayer , along with Mary the mother of Jesus , several other women , and the brothers of Jesus .
44:1:015:0	During this time , when about 120 believers were together in one place , Peter stood up and addressed them .
44:1:016:0	“ Brothers , ” he said , “ the Scriptures had to be fulfilled concerning Judas , who guided those who arrested Jesus . This was predicted long ago by the Holy Spirit , speaking through King David .
44:1:017:0	Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us . ”
44:1:018:0	( Judas had bought a field with the money he received for his treachery . Falling headfirst there , his body split open , spilling out all his intestines .
44:1:019:0	The news of his death spread to all the people of Jerusalem , and they gave the place the Aramaic name Akeldama , which means “ Field of Blood . ” )
44:1:020:0	Peter continued , “ This was written in the book of Psalms , where it says , ‘ Let his home become desolate , with no one living in it . ' It also says , ‘ Let someone else take his position . '
44:1:021:0	“ So now we must choose a replacement for Judas from among the men who were with us the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus—
44:1:022:0	from the time he was baptized by John until the day he was taken from us . Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus ' resurrection . ”
44:1:023:0	So they nominated two men : Joseph called Barsabbas ( also known as Justus ) and Matthias .
44:1:024:0	Then they all prayed , “ O Lord , you know every heart . Show us which of these men you have chosen
44:1:025:0	as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry , for he has deserted us and gone where he belongs . ”
44:1:026:0	Then they cast lots , and Matthias was selected to become an apostle with the other eleven .
