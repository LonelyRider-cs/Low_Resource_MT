44:19:001:1	Paul 's Third Missionary Journey
44:19:001:0	While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul traveled through the interior regions until he reached Ephesus , on the coast , where he found several believers .
44:19:002:0	“ Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ” he asked them. “ No , ” they replied , “ we have n't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . ”
44:19:003:0	“ Then what baptism did you experience ? ” he asked.And they replied , “ The baptism of John . ”
44:19:004:0	Paul said , “ John 's baptism called for repentance from sin . But John himself told the people to believe in the one who would come later , meaning Jesus . ”
44:19:005:0	As soon as they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44:19:006:0	Then when Paul laid his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they spoke in other tongues and prophesied .
44:19:002:1	Paul Ministers in Ephesus
44:19:007:0	There were about twelve men in all .
44:19:008:0	Then Paul went to the synagogue and preached boldly for the next three months , arguing persuasively about the Kingdom of God .
44:19:009:0	But some became stubborn , rejecting his message and publicly speaking against the Way . So Paul left the synagogue and took the believers with him . Then he held daily discussions at the lecture hall of Tyrannus .
44:19:010:0	This went on for the next two years , so that people throughout the province of Asia — both Jews and Greeks — heard the word of the Lord .
44:19:011:0	God gave Paul the power to perform unusual miracles .
44:19:012:0	When handkerchiefs or aprons that had merely touched his skin were placed on sick people , they were healed of their diseases , and evil spirits were expelled .
44:19:013:0	A group of Jews was traveling from town to town casting out evil spirits . They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus in their incantation , saying , “ I command you in the name of Jesus , whom Paul preaches , to come out ! ”
44:19:014:0	Seven sons of Sceva , a leading priest , were doing this .
44:19:015:0	But one time when they tried it , the evil spirit replied , “ I know Jesus , and I know Paul , but who are you ? ”
44:19:016:0	Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them , overpowered them , and attacked them with such violence that they fled from the house , naked and battered .
44:19:017:0	The story of what happened spread quickly all through Ephesus , to Jews and Greeks alike . A solemn fear descended on the city , and the name of the Lord Jesus was greatly honored .
44:19:018:0	Many who became believers confessed their sinful practices .
44:19:019:0	A number of them who had been practicing sorcery brought their incantation books and burned them at a public bonfire . The value of the books was several million dollars .
44:19:020:0	So the message about the Lord spread widely and had a powerful effect .
44:19:021:0	Afterward Paul felt compelled by the Spirit to go over to Macedonia and Achaia before going to Jerusalem . “ And after that , ” he said , “ I must go on to Rome ! ”
44:19:003:1	The Riot in Ephesus
44:19:022:0	He sent his two assistants , Timothy and Erastus , ahead to Macedonia while he stayed awhile longer in the province of Asia .
44:19:023:0	About that time , serious trouble developed in Ephesus concerning the Way .
44:19:024:0	It began with Demetrius , a silversmith who had a large business manufacturing silver shrines of the Greek goddess Artemis . He kept many craftsmen busy .
44:19:025:0	He called them together , along with others employed in similar trades , and addressed them as follows : “ Gentlemen , you know that our wealth comes from this business .
44:19:026:0	But as you have seen and heard , this man Paul has persuaded many people that handmade gods are n't really gods at all . And he 's done this not only here in Ephesus but throughout the entire province !
44:19:027:0	Of course , I 'm not just talking about the loss of public respect for our business . I 'm also concerned that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will lose its influence and that Artemis — this magnificent goddess worshiped throughout the province of Asia and all around the world — will be robbed of her great prestige ! ”
44:19:028:0	At this their anger boiled , and they began shouting , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44:19:029:0	Soon the whole city was filled with confusion . Everyone rushed to the amphitheater , dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus , who were Paul 's traveling companions from Macedonia .
44:19:030:0	Paul wanted to go in , too , but the believers would n't let him .
44:19:031:0	Some of the officials of the province , friends of Paul , also sent a message to him , begging him not to risk his life by entering the amphitheater .
44:19:032:0	Inside , the people were all shouting , some one thing and some another . Everything was in confusion . In fact , most of them did n't even know why they were there .
44:19:033:0	The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward and told him to explain the situation . He motioned for silence and tried to speak .
44:19:034:0	But when the crowd realized he was a Jew , they started shouting again and kept it up for about two hours : “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44:19:035:0	At last the mayor was able to quiet them down enough to speak . “ Citizens of Ephesus , ” he said . “ Everyone knows that Ephesus is the official guardian of the temple of the great Artemis , whose image fell down to us from heaven .
44:19:036:0	Since this is an undeniable fact , you should stay calm and not do anything rash .
44:19:037:0	You have brought these men here , but they have stolen nothing from the temple and have not spoken against our goddess .
44:19:038:0	“ If Demetrius and the craftsmen have a case against them , the courts are in session and the officials can hear the case at once . Let them make formal charges .
44:19:039:0	And if there are complaints about other matters , they can be settled in a legal assembly .
44:19:040:0	I am afraid we are in danger of being charged with rioting by the Roman government , since there is no cause for all this commotion . And if Rome demands an explanation , we wo n't know what to say . ”
44:19:041:0	Then he dismissed them , and they dispersed .
