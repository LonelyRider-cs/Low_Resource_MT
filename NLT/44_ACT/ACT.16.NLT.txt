44:16:001:1	Paul 's Second Missionary Journey
44:16:001:0	Paul went first to Derbe and then to Lystra , where there was a young disciple named Timothy . His mother was a Jewish believer , but his father was a Greek .
44:16:002:0	Timothy was well thought of by the believers in Lystra and Iconium ,
44:16:003:0	so Paul wanted him to join them on their journey . In deference to the Jews of the area , he arranged for Timothy to be circumcised before they left , for everyone knew that his father was a Greek .
44:16:004:0	Then they went from town to town , instructing the believers to follow the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem .
44:16:002:1	A Call from Macedonia
44:16:005:0	So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day .
44:16:006:0	Next Paul and Silas traveled through the area of Phrygia and Galatia , because the Holy Spirit had prevented them from preaching the word in the province of Asia at that time .
44:16:007:0	Then coming to the borders of Mysia , they headed north for the province of Bithynia , but again the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go there .
44:16:008:0	So instead , they went on through Mysia to the seaport of Troas .
44:16:009:0	That night Paul had a vision : A man from Macedonia in northern Greece was standing there , pleading with him , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us ! ”
44:16:003:1	Lydia of Philippi Believes in Jesus
44:16:010:0	So we decided to leave for Macedonia at once , having concluded that God was calling us to preach the Good News there .
44:16:011:0	We boarded a boat at Troas and sailed straight across to the island of Samothrace , and the next day we landed at Neapolis .
44:16:012:0	From there we reached Philippi , a major city of that district of Macedonia and a Roman colony . And we stayed there several days .
44:16:013:0	On the Sabbath we went a little way outside the city to a riverbank , where we thought people would be meeting for prayer , and we sat down to speak with some women who had gathered there .
44:16:014:0	One of them was Lydia from Thyatira , a merchant of expensive purple cloth , who worshiped God . As she listened to us , the Lord opened her heart , and she accepted what Paul was saying .
44:16:004:1	Paul and Silas in Prison
44:16:015:0	She and her household were baptized , and she asked us to be her guests . “ If you agree that I am a true believer in the Lord , ” she said , “ come and stay at my home. ” And she urged us until we agreed .
44:16:016:0	One day as we were going down to the place of prayer , we met a slave girl who had a spirit that enabled her to tell the future . She earned a lot of money for her masters by telling fortunes .
44:16:017:0	She followed Paul and the rest of us , shouting , “ These men are servants of the Most High God , and they have come to tell you how to be saved . ”
44:16:018:0	This went on day after day until Paul got so exasperated that he turned and said to the demon within her , “ I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. ” And instantly it left her .
44:16:019:0	Her masters ' hopes of wealth were now shattered , so they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities at the marketplace .
44:16:020:0	“ The whole city is in an uproar because of these Jews ! ” they shouted to the city officials .
44:16:021:0	“ They are teaching customs that are illegal for us Romans to practice . ”
44:16:022:0	A mob quickly formed against Paul and Silas , and the city officials ordered them stripped and beaten with wooden rods .
44:16:023:0	They were severely beaten , and then they were thrown into prison . The jailer was ordered to make sure they did n't escape .
44:16:024:0	So the jailer put them into the inner dungeon and clamped their feet in the stocks .
44:16:025:0	Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the other prisoners were listening .
44:16:026:0	Suddenly , there was a massive earthquake , and the prison was shaken to its foundations . All the doors immediately flew open , and the chains of every prisoner fell off !
44:16:027:0	The jailer woke up to see the prison doors wide open . He assumed the prisoners had escaped , so he drew his sword to kill himself .
44:16:028:0	But Paul shouted to him , “ Stop ! Do n't kill yourself ! We are all here ! ”
44:16:029:0	The jailer called for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas .
44:16:030:0	Then he brought them out and asked , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44:16:031:0	They replied , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved , along with everyone in your household . ”
44:16:032:0	And they shared the word of the Lord with him and with all who lived in his household .
44:16:033:0	Even at that hour of the night , the jailer cared for them and washed their wounds . Then he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized .
44:16:034:0	He brought them into his house and set a meal before them , and he and his entire household rejoiced because they all believed in God .
44:16:035:0	The next morning the city officials sent the police to tell the jailer , “ Let those men go ! ”
44:16:036:0	So the jailer told Paul , “ The city officials have said you and Silas are free to leave . Go in peace . ”
44:16:037:0	But Paul replied , “ They have publicly beaten us without a trial and put us in prison—and we are Roman citizens . So now they want us to leave secretly ? Certainly not ! Let them come themselves to release us ! ”
44:16:038:0	When the police reported this , the city officials were alarmed to learn that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens .
44:16:039:0	So they came to the jail and apologized to them . Then they brought them out and begged them to leave the city .
44:16:040:0	When Paul and Silas left the prison , they returned to the home of Lydia . There they met with the believers and encouraged them once more . Then they left town .
