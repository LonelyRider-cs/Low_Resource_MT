44:18:001:1	Paul Meets Priscilla and Aquila in Corinth
44:18:001:0	Then Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44:18:002:0	There he became acquainted with a Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife , Priscilla . They had left Italy when Claudius Caesar deported all Jews from Rome .
44:18:003:0	Paul lived and worked with them , for they were tentmakers just as he was .
44:18:004:0	Each Sabbath found Paul at the synagogue , trying to convince the Jews and Greeks alike .
44:18:005:0	And after Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul spent all his time preaching the word . He testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah .
44:18:006:0	But when they opposed and insulted him , Paul shook the dust from his clothes and said , “ Your blood is upon your own heads—I am innocent . From now on I will go preach to the Gentiles . ”
44:18:007:0	Then he left and went to the home of Titius Justus , a Gentile who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue .
44:18:008:0	Crispus , the leader of the synagogue , and everyone in his household believed in the Lord . Many others in Corinth also heard Paul , became believers , and were baptized .
44:18:009:0	One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him , “ Do n't be afraid ! Speak out ! Do n't be silent !
44:18:010:0	For I am with you , and no one will attack and harm you , for many people in this city belong to me . ”
44:18:011:0	So Paul stayed there for the next year and a half , teaching the word of God .
44:18:012:0	But when Gallio became governor of Achaia , some Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the governor for judgment .
44:18:013:0	They accused Paul of “ persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our law . ”
44:18:014:0	But just as Paul started to make his defense , Gallio turned to Paul 's accusers and said , “ Listen , you Jews , if this were a case involving some wrongdoing or a serious crime , I would have a reason to accept your case .
44:18:015:0	But since it is merely a question of words and names and your Jewish law , take care of it yourselves . I refuse to judge such matters . ”
44:18:016:0	And he threw them out of the courtroom .
44:18:002:1	Paul Returns to Antioch of Syria
44:18:017:0	The crowd then grabbed Sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue , and beat him right there in the courtroom . But Gallio paid no attention .
44:18:018:0	Paul stayed in Corinth for some time after that , then said good-bye to the brothers and sisters and went to nearby Cenchrea . There he shaved his head according to Jewish custom , marking the end of a vow . Then he set sail for Syria , taking Priscilla and Aquila with him .
44:18:019:0	They stopped first at the port of Ephesus , where Paul left the others behind . While he was there , he went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews .
44:18:020:0	They asked him to stay longer , but he declined .
44:18:021:0	As he left , however , he said , “ I will come back later , God willing. ” Then he set sail from Ephesus .
44:18:022:0	The next stop was at the port of Caesarea . From there he went up and visited the church at Jerusalem and then went back to Antioch .
44:18:003:1	Apollos Instructed at Ephesus
44:18:023:0	After spending some time in Antioch , Paul went back through Galatia and Phrygia , visiting and strengthening all the believers .
44:18:024:0	Meanwhile , a Jew named Apollos , an eloquent speaker who knew the Scriptures well , had arrived in Ephesus from Alexandria in Egypt .
44:18:025:0	He had been taught the way of the Lord , and he taught others about Jesus with an enthusiastic spirit and with accuracy . However , he knew only about John 's baptism .
44:18:026:0	When Priscilla and Aquila heard him preaching boldly in the synagogue , they took him aside and explained the way of God even more accurately .
44:18:027:0	Apollos had been thinking about going to Achaia , and the brothers and sisters in Ephesus encouraged him to go . They wrote to the believers in Achaia , asking them to welcome him . When he arrived there , he proved to be of great benefit to those who , by God 's grace , had believed .
44:18:028:0	He refuted the Jews with powerful arguments in public debate . Using the Scriptures , he explained to them that Jesus was the Messiah .
