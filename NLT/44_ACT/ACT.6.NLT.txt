44:6:001:1	Seven Men Chosen to Serve
44:6:001:0	But as the believers rapidly multiplied , there were rumblings of discontent . The Greek-speaking believers complained about the Hebrew-speaking believers , saying that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food .
44:6:002:0	So the Twelve called a meeting of all the believers . They said , “ We apostles should spend our time teaching the word of God , not running a food program .
44:6:003:0	And so , brothers , select seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit and wisdom . We will give them this responsibility .
44:6:004:0	Then we apostles can spend our time in prayer and teaching the word . ”
44:6:005:0	Everyone liked this idea , and they chose the following : Stephen ( a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit ) , Philip , Procorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolas of Antioch ( an earlier convert to the Jewish faith ) .
44:6:006:0	These seven were presented to the apostles , who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them .
44:6:002:1	Stephen Is Arrested
44:6:007:0	So God 's message continued to spread . The number of believers greatly increased in Jerusalem , and many of the Jewish priests were converted , too .
44:6:008:0	Stephen , a man full of God 's grace and power , performed amazing miracles and signs among the people .
44:6:009:0	But one day some men from the Synagogue of Freed Slaves , as it was called , started to debate with him . They were Jews from Cyrene , Alexandria , Cilicia , and the province of Asia .
44:6:010:0	None of them could stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke .
44:6:011:0	So they persuaded some men to lie about Stephen , saying , “ We heard him blaspheme Moses , and even God . ”
44:6:012:0	This roused the people , the elders , and the teachers of religious law . So they arrested Stephen and brought him before the high council .
44:6:013:0	The lying witnesses said , “ This man is always speaking against the holy Temple and against the law of Moses .
44:6:014:0	We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the Temple and change the customs Moses handed down to us . ”
44:6:015:0	At this point everyone in the high council stared at Stephen , because his face became as bright as an angel 's .
