44:15:001:1	The Council at Jerusalem
44:15:001:0	While Paul and Barnabas were at Antioch of Syria , some men from Judea arrived and began to teach the believers : “ Unless you are circumcised as required by the law of Moses , you can not be saved . ”
44:15:002:0	Paul and Barnabas disagreed with them , arguing vehemently . Finally , the church decided to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem , accompanied by some local believers , to talk to the apostles and elders about this question .
44:15:003:0	The church sent the delegates to Jerusalem , and they stopped along the way in Phoenicia and Samaria to visit the believers . They told them—much to everyone 's joy—that the Gentiles , too , were being converted .
44:15:004:0	When they arrived in Jerusalem , Barnabas and Paul were welcomed by the whole church , including the apostles and elders . They reported everything God had done through them .
44:15:005:0	But then some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and insisted , “ The Gentile converts must be circumcised and required to follow the law of Moses . ”
44:15:006:0	So the apostles and elders met together to resolve this issue .
44:15:007:0	At the meeting , after a long discussion , Peter stood and addressed them as follows : “ Brothers , you all know that God chose me from among you some time ago to preach to the Gentiles so that they could hear the Good News and believe .
44:15:008:0	God knows people 's hearts , and he confirmed that he accepts Gentiles by giving them the Holy Spirit , just as he did to us .
44:15:009:0	He made no distinction between us and them , for he cleansed their hearts through faith .
44:15:010:0	So why are you now challenging God by burdening the Gentile believers with a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors were able to bear ?
44:15:011:0	We believe that we are all saved the same way , by the undeserved grace of the Lord Jesus . ”
44:15:012:0	Everyone listened quietly as Barnabas and Paul told about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles .
44:15:013:0	When they had finished , James stood and said , “ Brothers , listen to me .
44:15:014:0	Peter has told you about the time God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for himself .
44:15:015:0	And this conversion of Gentiles is exactly what the prophets predicted . As it is written :
44:15:016:0	‘ Afterward I will returnand restore the fallen house of David.I will rebuild its ruinsand restore it ,
44:15:017:0	so that the rest of humanity might seek the Lord , including the Gentiles—all those I have called to be mine.The Lord has spoken—
44:15:018:0	he who made these things known so long ago . '
44:15:019:0	“ And so my judgment is that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God .
44:15:020:0	Instead , we should write and tell them to abstain from eating food offered to idols , from sexual immorality , from eating the meat of strangled animals , and from consuming blood .
44:15:002:1	The Letter for Gentile Believers
44:15:021:0	For these laws of Moses have been preached in Jewish synagogues in every city on every Sabbath for many generations . ”
44:15:022:0	Then the apostles and elders together with the whole church in Jerusalem chose delegates , and they sent them to Antioch of Syria with Paul and Barnabas to report on this decision . The men chosen were two of the church leaders—Judas ( also called Barsabbas ) and Silas .
44:15:023:0	This is the letter they took with them : “ This letter is from the apostles and elders , your brothers in Jerusalem . It is written to the Gentile believers in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia . Greetings !
44:15:024:0	“ We understand that some men from here have troubled you and upset you with their teaching , but we did not send them !
44:15:025:0	So we decided , having come to complete agreement , to send you official representatives , along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44:15:026:0	who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44:15:027:0	We are sending Judas and Silas to confirm what we have decided concerning your question .
44:15:028:0	“ For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay no greater burden on you than these few requirements :
44:15:029:0	You must abstain from eating food offered to idols , from consuming blood or the meat of strangled animals , and from sexual immorality . If you do this , you will do well . Farewell . ”
44:15:030:0	The messengers went at once to Antioch , where they called a general meeting of the believers and delivered the letter .
44:15:031:0	And there was great joy throughout the church that day as they read this encouraging message .
44:15:032:0	Then Judas and Silas , both being prophets , spoke at length to the believers , encouraging and strengthening their faith .
44:15:033:0	They stayed for a while , and then the believers sent them back to the church in Jerusalem with a blessing of peace .
44:15:003:1	Paul and Barnabas Separate
44:15:035:0	Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch . They and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord there .
44:15:036:0	After some time Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let 's go back and visit each city where we previously preached the word of the Lord , to see how the new believers are doing . ”
44:15:037:0	Barnabas agreed and wanted to take along John Mark .
44:15:038:0	But Paul disagreed strongly , since John Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in their work .
44:15:039:0	Their disagreement was so sharp that they separated . Barnabas took John Mark with him and sailed for Cyprus .
44:15:040:0	Paul chose Silas , and as he left , the believers entrusted him to the Lord 's gracious care .
44:15:041:0	Then he traveled throughout Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches there .
