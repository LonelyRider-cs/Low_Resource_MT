44:8:001:1	Persecution Scatters the Believers
44:8:001:0	Saul was one of the witnesses , and he agreed completely with the killing of Stephen.A great wave of persecution began that day , sweeping over the church in Jerusalem ; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria .
44:8:002:0	( Some devout men came and buried Stephen with great mourning . )
44:8:002:1	Philip Preaches in Samaria
44:8:003:0	But Saul was going everywhere to destroy the church . He went from house to house , dragging out both men and women to throw them into prison .
44:8:004:0	But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went .
44:8:005:0	Philip , for example , went to the city of Samaria and told the people there about the Messiah .
44:8:006:0	Crowds listened intently to Philip because they were eager to hear his message and see the miraculous signs he did .
44:8:007:0	Many evil spirits were cast out , screaming as they left their victims . And many who had been paralyzed or lame were healed .
44:8:008:0	So there was great joy in that city .
44:8:009:0	A man named Simon had been a sorcerer there for many years , amazing the people of Samaria and claiming to be someone great .
44:8:010:0	Everyone , from the least to the greatest , often spoke of him as “ the Great One — the Power of God . ”
44:8:011:0	They listened closely to him because for a long time he had astounded them with his magic .
44:8:012:0	But now the people believed Philip 's message of Good News concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ . As a result , many men and women were baptized .
44:8:013:0	Then Simon himself believed and was baptized . He began following Philip wherever he went , and he was amazed by the signs and great miracles Philip performed .
44:8:014:0	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted God 's message , they sent Peter and John there .
44:8:015:0	As soon as they arrived , they prayed for these new believers to receive the Holy Spirit .
44:8:016:0	The Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them , for they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44:8:017:0	Then Peter and John laid their hands upon these believers , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44:8:018:0	When Simon saw that the Spirit was given when the apostles laid their hands on people , he offered them money to buy this power .
44:8:019:0	“ Let me have this power , too , ” he exclaimed , “ so that when I lay my hands on people , they will receive the Holy Spirit ! ”
44:8:020:0	But Peter replied , “ May your money be destroyed with you for thinking God 's gift can be bought !
44:8:021:0	You can have no part in this , for your heart is not right with God .
44:8:022:0	Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord . Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts ,
44:8:023:0	for I can see that you are full of bitter jealousy and are held captive by sin . ”
44:8:024:0	“ Pray to the Lord for me , ” Simon exclaimed , “ that these terrible things you 've said wo n't happen to me ! ”
44:8:003:1	Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch
44:8:025:0	After testifying and preaching the word of the Lord in Samaria , Peter and John returned to Jerusalem . And they stopped in many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the Good News .
44:8:026:0	As for Philip , an angel of the Lord said to him , “ Go south down the desert road that runs from Jerusalem to Gaza . ”
44:8:027:0	So he started out , and he met the treasurer of Ethiopia , a eunuch of great authority under the Kandake , the queen of Ethiopia . The eunuch had gone to Jerusalem to worship ,
44:8:028:0	and he was now returning . Seated in his carriage , he was reading aloud from the book of the prophet Isaiah .
44:8:029:0	The Holy Spirit said to Philip , “ Go over and walk along beside the carriage . ”
44:8:030:0	Philip ran over and heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah . Philip asked , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44:8:031:0	The man replied , “ How can I , unless someone instructs me ? ” And he urged Philip to come up into the carriage and sit with him .
44:8:032:0	The passage of Scripture he had been reading was this : “ He was led like a sheep to the slaughter.And as a lamb is silent before the shearers , he did not open his mouth .
44:8:033:0	He was humiliated and received no justice.Who can speak of his descendants ? For his life was taken from the earth . ”
44:8:034:0	The eunuch asked Philip , “ Tell me , was the prophet talking about himself or someone else ? ”
44:8:035:0	So beginning with this same Scripture , Philip told him the Good News about Jesus .
44:8:036:0	As they rode along , they came to some water , and the eunuch said , “ Look ! There 's some water ! Why ca n't I be baptized ? ”
44:8:038:0	He ordered the carriage to stop , and they went down into the water , and Philip baptized him .
44:8:039:0	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away . The eunuch never saw him again but went on his way rejoicing .
44:8:040:0	Meanwhile , Philip found himself farther north at the town of Azotus . He preached the Good News there and in every town along the way until he came to Caesarea .
