44:4:001:1	Peter and John before the Council
44:4:001:0	While Peter and John were speaking to the people , they were confronted by the priests , the captain of the Temple guard , and some of the Sadducees .
44:4:002:0	These leaders were very disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people that through Jesus there is a resurrection of the dead .
44:4:003:0	They arrested them and , since it was already evening , put them in jail until morning .
44:4:004:0	But many of the people who heard their message believed it , so the number of men who believed now totaled about 5,000 .
44:4:005:0	The next day the council of all the rulers and elders and teachers of religious law met in Jerusalem .
44:4:006:0	Annas the high priest was there , along with Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and other relatives of the high priest .
44:4:007:0	They brought in the two disciples and demanded , “ By what power , or in whose name , have you done this ? ”
44:4:008:0	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , “ Rulers and elders of our people ,
44:4:009:0	are we being questioned today because we 've done a good deed for a crippled man ? Do you want to know how he was healed ?
44:4:010:0	Let me clearly state to all of you and to all the people of Israel that he was healed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , the man you crucified but whom God raised from the dead .
44:4:011:0	For Jesus is the one referred to in the Scriptures , where it says , ‘ The stone that you builders rejectedhas now become the cornerstone . '
44:4:012:0	There is salvation in no one else ! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved . ”
44:4:013:0	The members of the council were amazed when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , for they could see that they were ordinary men with no special training in the Scriptures . They also recognized them as men who had been with Jesus .
44:4:014:0	But since they could see the man who had been healed standing right there among them , there was nothing the council could say .
44:4:015:0	So they ordered Peter and John out of the council chamber and conferred among themselves .
44:4:016:0	“ What should we do with these men ? ” they asked each other . “ We ca n't deny that they have performed a miraculous sign , and everybody in Jerusalem knows about it .
44:4:017:0	But to keep them from spreading their propaganda any further , we must warn them not to speak to anyone in Jesus ' name again . ”
44:4:018:0	So they called the apostles back in and commanded them never again to speak or teach in the name of Jesus .
44:4:019:0	But Peter and John replied , “ Do you think God wants us to obey you rather than him ?
44:4:020:0	We can not stop telling about everything we have seen and heard . ”
44:4:021:0	The council then threatened them further , but they finally let them go because they did n't know how to punish them without starting a riot . For everyone was praising God
44:4:002:1	The Believers Pray for Courage
44:4:022:0	for this miraculous sign — the healing of a man who had been lame for more than forty years .
44:4:023:0	As soon as they were freed , Peter and John returned to the other believers and told them what the leading priests and elders had said .
44:4:024:0	When they heard the report , all the believers lifted their voices together in prayer to God : “ O Sovereign Lord , Creator of heaven and earth , the sea , and everything in them —
44:4:025:0	you spoke long ago by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David , your servant , saying , ‘ Why were the nations so angry ? Why did they waste their time with futile plans ?
44:4:026:0	The kings of the earth prepared for battle ; the rulers gathered togetheragainst the Lordand against his Messiah . '
44:4:027:0	“ In fact , this has happened here in this very city ! For Herod Antipas , Pontius Pilate the governor , the Gentiles , and the people of Israel were all united against Jesus , your holy servant , whom you anointed .
44:4:028:0	But everything they did was determined beforehand according to your will .
44:4:029:0	And now , O Lord , hear their threats , and give us , your servants , great boldness in preaching your word .
44:4:030:0	Stretch out your hand with healing power ; may miraculous signs and wonders be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus . ”
44:4:003:1	The Believers Share Their Possessions
44:4:031:0	After this prayer , the meeting place shook , and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit . Then they preached the word of God with boldness .
44:4:032:0	All the believers were united in heart and mind . And they felt that what they owned was not their own , so they shared everything they had .
44:4:033:0	The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and God 's great blessing was upon them all .
44:4:034:0	There were no needy people among them , because those who owned land or houses would sell them
44:4:035:0	and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need .
44:4:036:0	For instance , there was Joseph , the one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas ( which means “ Son of Encouragement ” ) . He was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus .
44:4:037:0	He sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles .
