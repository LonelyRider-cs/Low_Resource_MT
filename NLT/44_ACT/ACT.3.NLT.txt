44:3:001:1	Peter Heals a Crippled Beggar
44:3:001:0	Peter and John went to the Temple one afternoon to take part in the three o'clock prayer service .
44:3:002:0	As they approached the Temple , a man lame from birth was being carried in . Each day he was put beside the Temple gate , the one called the Beautiful Gate , so he could beg from the people going into the Temple .
44:3:003:0	When he saw Peter and John about to enter , he asked them for some money .
44:3:004:0	Peter and John looked at him intently , and Peter said , “ Look at us ! ”
44:3:005:0	The lame man looked at them eagerly , expecting some money .
44:3:006:0	But Peter said , “ I do n't have any silver or gold for you . But I 'll give you what I have . In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , get up and walk ! ”
44:3:007:0	Then Peter took the lame man by the right hand and helped him up . And as he did , the man 's feet and ankles were instantly healed and strengthened .
44:3:008:0	He jumped up , stood on his feet , and began to walk ! Then , walking , leaping , and praising God , he went into the Temple with them .
44:3:009:0	All the people saw him walking and heard him praising God .
44:3:010:0	When they realized he was the lame beggar they had seen so often at the Beautiful Gate , they were absolutely astounded !
44:3:002:1	Peter Preaches in the Temple
44:3:011:0	They all rushed out in amazement to Solomon 's Colonnade , where the man was holding tightly to Peter and John .
44:3:012:0	Peter saw his opportunity and addressed the crowd . “ People of Israel , ” he said , “ what is so surprising about this ? And why stare at us as though we had made this man walk by our own power or godliness ?
44:3:013:0	For it is the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob—the God of all our ancestors—who has brought glory to his servant Jesus by doing this . This is the same Jesus whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate , despite Pilate 's decision to release him .
44:3:014:0	You rejected this holy , righteous one and instead demanded the release of a murderer .
44:3:015:0	You killed the author of life , but God raised him from the dead . And we are witnesses of this fact !
44:3:016:0	“ Through faith in the name of Jesus , this man was healed—and you know how crippled he was before . Faith in Jesus ' name has healed him before your very eyes .
44:3:017:0	“ Friends , I realize that what you and your leaders did to Jesus was done in ignorance .
44:3:018:0	But God was fulfilling what all the prophets had foretold about the Messiah—that he must suffer these things .
44:3:019:0	Now repent of your sins and turn to God , so that your sins may be wiped away .
44:3:020:0	Then times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord , and he will again send you Jesus , your appointed Messiah .
44:3:021:0	For he must remain in heaven until the time for the final restoration of all things , as God promised long ago through his holy prophets .
44:3:022:0	Moses said , ‘ The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your own people . Listen carefully to everything he tells you . '
44:3:023:0	Then Moses said , ‘ Anyone who will not listen to that Prophet will be completely cut off from God 's people . '
44:3:024:0	“ Starting with Samuel , every prophet spoke about what is happening today .
44:3:025:0	You are the children of those prophets , and you are included in the covenant God promised to your ancestors . For God said to Abraham , ‘ Through your descendants all the families on earth will be blessed . '
44:3:026:0	When God raised up his servant , Jesus , he sent him first to you people of Israel , to bless you by turning each of you back from your sinful ways . ”
