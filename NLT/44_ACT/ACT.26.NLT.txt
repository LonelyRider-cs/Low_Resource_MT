44:26:001:0	Then Agrippa said to Paul , “ You may speak in your defense. ” So Paul , gesturing with his hand , started his defense :
44:26:002:0	“ I am fortunate , King Agrippa , that you are the one hearing my defense today against all these accusations made by the Jewish leaders ,
44:26:003:0	for I know you are an expert on all Jewish customs and controversies . Now please listen to me patiently !
44:26:004:0	“ As the Jewish leaders are well aware , I was given a thorough Jewish training from my earliest childhood among my own people and in Jerusalem .
44:26:005:0	If they would admit it , they know that I have been a member of the Pharisees , the strictest sect of our religion .
44:26:006:0	Now I am on trial because of my hope in the fulfillment of God 's promise made to our ancestors .
44:26:007:0	In fact , that is why the twelve tribes of Israel zealously worship God night and day , and they share the same hope I have . Yet , Your Majesty , they accuse me for having this hope !
44:26:008:0	Why does it seem incredible to any of you that God can raise the dead ?
44:26:009:0	“ I used to believe that I ought to do everything I could to oppose the very name of Jesus the Nazarene .
44:26:010:0	Indeed , I did just that in Jerusalem . Authorized by the leading priests , I caused many believers there to be sent to prison . And I cast my vote against them when they were condemned to death .
44:26:011:0	Many times I had them punished in the synagogues to get them to curse Jesus . I was so violently opposed to them that I even chased them down in foreign cities .
44:26:012:0	“ One day I was on such a mission to Damascus , armed with the authority and commission of the leading priests .
44:26:013:0	About noon , Your Majesty , as I was on the road , a light from heaven brighter than the sun shone down on me and my companions .
44:26:014:0	We all fell down , and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? It is useless for you to fight against my will . '
44:26:015:0	“ ‘ Who are you , lord ? ' I asked. “ And the Lord replied , ‘ I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting .
44:26:016:0	Now get to your feet ! For I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant and witness . Tell people that you have seen me , and tell them what I will show you in the future .
44:26:017:0	And I will rescue you from both your own people and the Gentiles . Yes , I am sending you to the Gentiles
44:26:018:0	to open their eyes , so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God . Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and be given a place among God 's people , who are set apart by faith in me . '
44:26:019:0	“ And so , King Agrippa , I obeyed that vision from heaven .
44:26:020:0	I preached first to those in Damascus , then in Jerusalem and throughout all Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that all must repent of their sins and turn to God—and prove they have changed by the good things they do .
44:26:021:0	Some Jews arrested me in the Temple for preaching this , and they tried to kill me .
44:26:022:0	But God has protected me right up to this present time so I can testify to everyone , from the least to the greatest . I teach nothing except what the prophets and Moses said would happen—
44:26:023:0	that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead , and in this way announce God 's light to Jews and Gentiles alike . ”
44:26:024:0	Suddenly , Festus shouted , “ Paul , you are insane . Too much study has made you crazy ! ”
44:26:025:0	But Paul replied , “ I am not insane , Most Excellent Festus . What I am saying is the sober truth .
44:26:026:0	And King Agrippa knows about these things . I speak boldly , for I am sure these events are all familiar to him , for they were not done in a corner !
44:26:027:0	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know you do— ”
44:26:028:0	Agrippa interrupted him . “ Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly ? ”
44:26:029:0	Paul replied , “ Whether quickly or not , I pray to God that both you and everyone here in this audience might become the same as I am , except for these chains . ”
44:26:030:0	Then the king , the governor , Bernice , and all the others stood and left .
44:26:031:0	As they went out , they talked it over and agreed , “ This man has n't done anything to deserve death or imprisonment . ”
44:26:032:0	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ He could have been set free if he had n't appealed to Caesar . ”
