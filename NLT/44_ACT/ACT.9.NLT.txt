44:9:001:1	Saul 's Conversion
44:9:001:0	Meanwhile , Saul was uttering threats with every breath and was eager to kill the Lord 's followers . So he went to the high priest .
44:9:002:0	He requested letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus , asking for their cooperation in the arrest of any followers of the Way he found there . He wanted to bring them — both men and women — back to Jerusalem in chains .
44:9:003:0	As he was approaching Damascus on this mission , a light from heaven suddenly shone down around him .
44:9:004:0	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul ! Saul ! Why are you persecuting me ? ”
44:9:005:0	“ Who are you , lord ? ” Saul asked.And the voice replied , “ I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting !
44:9:006:0	Now get up and go into the city , and you will be told what you must do . ”
44:9:007:0	The men with Saul stood speechless , for they heard the sound of someone 's voice but saw no one !
44:9:008:0	Saul picked himself up off the ground , but when he opened his eyes he was blind . So his companions led him by the hand to Damascus .
44:9:009:0	He remained there blind for three days and did not eat or drink .
44:9:010:0	Now there was a believer in Damascus named Ananias . The Lord spoke to him in a vision , calling , “ Ananias ! ” “ Yes , Lord ! ” he replied .
44:9:011:0	The Lord said , “ Go over to Straight Street , to the house of Judas . When you get there , ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul . He is praying to me right now .
44:9:012:0	I have shown him a vision of a man named Ananias coming in and laying hands on him so he can see again . ”
44:9:013:0	“ But Lord , ” exclaimed Ananias , “ I 've heard many people talk about the terrible things this man has done to the believers in Jerusalem !
44:9:014:0	And he is authorized by the leading priests to arrest everyone who calls upon your name . ”
44:9:015:0	But the Lord said , “ Go , for Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings , as well as to the people of Israel .
44:9:016:0	And I will show him how much he must suffer for my name 's sake . ”
44:9:017:0	So Ananias went and found Saul . He laid his hands on him and said , “ Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , who appeared to you on the road , has sent me so that you might regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44:9:018:0	Instantly something like scales fell from Saul 's eyes , and he regained his sight . Then he got up and was baptized .
44:9:002:1	Saul in Damascus and Jerusalem
44:9:019:0	Afterward he ate some food and regained his strength.Saul stayed with the believers in Damascus for a few days .
44:9:020:0	And immediately he began preaching about Jesus in the synagogues , saying , “ He is indeed the Son of God ! ”
44:9:021:0	All who heard him were amazed . “ Is n't this the same man who caused such devastation among Jesus ' followers in Jerusalem ? ” they asked . “ And did n't he come here to arrest them and take them in chains to the leading priests ? ”
44:9:022:0	Saul 's preaching became more and more powerful , and the Jews in Damascus could n't refute his proofs that Jesus was indeed the Messiah .
44:9:023:0	After a while some of the Jews plotted together to kill him .
44:9:024:0	They were watching for him day and night at the city gate so they could murder him , but Saul was told about their plot .
44:9:025:0	So during the night , some of the other believers lowered him in a large basket through an opening in the city wall .
44:9:026:0	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem , he tried to meet with the believers , but they were all afraid of him . They did not believe he had truly become a believer !
44:9:027:0	Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the way to Damascus and how the Lord had spoken to Saul . He also told them that Saul had preached boldly in the name of Jesus in Damascus .
44:9:028:0	So Saul stayed with the apostles and went all around Jerusalem with them , preaching boldly in the name of the Lord .
44:9:029:0	He debated with some Greek-speaking Jews , but they tried to murder him .
44:9:030:0	When the believers heard about this , they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus , his hometown .
44:9:003:1	Peter Heals Aeneas and Raises Dorcas
44:9:031:0	The church then had peace throughout Judea , Galilee , and Samaria , and it became stronger as the believers lived in the fear of the Lord . And with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit , it also grew in numbers .
44:9:032:0	Meanwhile , Peter traveled from place to place , and he came down to visit the believers in the town of Lydda .
44:9:033:0	There he met a man named Aeneas , who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years .
44:9:034:0	Peter said to him , “ Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you ! Get up , and roll up your sleeping mat ! ” And he was healed instantly .
44:9:035:0	Then the whole population of Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas walking around , and they turned to the Lord .
44:9:036:0	There was a believer in Joppa named Tabitha ( which in Greek is Dorcas ) . She was always doing kind things for others and helping the poor .
44:9:037:0	About this time she became ill and died . Her body was washed for burial and laid in an upstairs room .
44:9:038:0	But the believers had heard that Peter was nearby at Lydda , so they sent two men to beg him , “ Please come as soon as possible ! ”
44:9:039:0	So Peter returned with them ; and as soon as he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room . The room was filled with widows who were weeping and showing him the coats and other clothes Dorcas had made for them .
44:9:040:0	But Peter asked them all to leave the room ; then he knelt and prayed . Turning to the body he said , “ Get up , Tabitha. ” And she opened her eyes ! When she saw Peter , she sat up !
44:9:041:0	He gave her his hand and helped her up . Then he called in the widows and all the believers , and he presented her to them alive .
44:9:042:0	The news spread through the whole town , and many believed in the Lord .
44:9:043:0	And Peter stayed a long time in Joppa , living with Simon , a tanner of hides .
