44:2:001:1	The Holy Spirit Comes
44:2:001:0	On the day of Pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place .
44:2:002:0	Suddenly , there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm , and it filled the house where they were sitting .
44:2:003:0	Then , what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them .
44:2:004:0	And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages , as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability .
44:2:005:0	At that time there were devout Jews from every nation living in Jerusalem .
44:2:006:0	When they heard the loud noise , everyone came running , and they were bewildered to hear their own languages being spoken by the believers .
44:2:007:0	They were completely amazed . “ How can this be ? ” they exclaimed . “ These people are all from Galilee ,
44:2:008:0	and yet we hear them speaking in our own native languages !
44:2:009:0	Here we are — Parthians , Medes , Elamites , people from Mesopotamia , Judea , Cappadocia , Pontus , the province of Asia ,
44:2:010:0	Phrygia , Pamphylia , Egypt , and the areas of Libya around Cyrene , visitors from Rome
44:2:011:0	( both Jews and converts to Judaism ) , Cretans , and Arabs . And we all hear these people speaking in our own languages about the wonderful things God has done ! ”
44:2:012:0	They stood there amazed and perplexed . “ What can this mean ? ” they asked each other .
44:2:002:1	Peter Preaches to the Crowd
44:2:013:0	But others in the crowd ridiculed them , saying , “ They 're just drunk , that 's all ! ”
44:2:014:0	Then Peter stepped forward with the eleven other apostles and shouted to the crowd , “ Listen carefully , all of you , fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem ! Make no mistake about this .
44:2:015:0	These people are not drunk , as some of you are assuming . Nine o'clock in the morning is much too early for that .
44:2:016:0	No , what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel :
44:2:017:0	‘ In the last days , ' God says , ‘ I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.Your sons and daughters will prophesy.Your young men will see visions , and your old men will dream dreams .
44:2:018:0	In those days I will pour out my Spiriteven on my servants — men and women alike — and they will prophesy .
44:2:019:0	And I will cause wonders in the heavens aboveand signs on the earth below — blood and fire and clouds of smoke .
44:2:020:0	The sun will become dark , and the moon will turn blood redbefore that great and glorious day of the Lord arrives .
44:2:021:0	But everyone who calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved . '
44:2:022:0	“ People of Israel , listen ! God publicly endorsed Jesus the Nazarene by doing powerful miracles , wonders , and signs through him , as you well know .
44:2:023:0	But God knew what would happen , and his prearranged plan was carried out when Jesus was betrayed . With the help of lawless Gentiles , you nailed him to a cross and killed him .
44:2:024:0	But God released him from the horrors of death and raised him back to life , for death could not keep him in its grip .
44:2:025:0	King David said this about him : ‘ I see that the Lord is always with me.I will not be shaken , for he is right beside me .
44:2:026:0	No wonder my heart is glad , and my tongue shouts his praises ! My body rests in hope .
44:2:027:0	For you will not leave my soul among the deador allow your Holy One to rot in the grave .
44:2:028:0	You have shown me the way of life , and you will fill me with the joy of your presence . '
44:2:029:0	“ Dear brothers , think about this ! You can be sure that the patriarch David was n't referring to himself , for he died and was buried , and his tomb is still here among us .
44:2:030:0	But he was a prophet , and he knew God had promised with an oath that one of David 's own descendants would sit on his throne .
44:2:031:0	David was looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah 's resurrection . He was saying that God would not leave him among the dead or allow his body to rot in the grave .
44:2:032:0	“ God raised Jesus from the dead , and we are all witnesses of this .
44:2:033:0	Now he is exalted to the place of highest honor in heaven , at God 's right hand . And the Father , as he had promised , gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us , just as you see and hear today .
44:2:034:0	For David himself never ascended into heaven , yet he said , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
44:2:035:0	until I humble your enemies , making them a footstool under your feet . ” '
44:2:036:0	“ So let everyone in Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus , whom you crucified , to be both Lord and Messiah ! ”
44:2:037:0	Peter 's words pierced their hearts , and they said to him and to the other apostles , “ Brothers , what should we do ? ”
44:2:038:0	Peter replied , “ Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God , and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins . Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44:2:039:0	This promise is to you , to your children , and to those far away — all who have been called by the Lord our God . ”
44:2:040:0	Then Peter continued preaching for a long time , strongly urging all his listeners , “ Save yourselves from this crooked generation ! ”
44:2:003:1	The Believers Form a Community
44:2:041:0	Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day — about 3,000 in all .
44:2:042:0	All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles ' teaching , and to fellowship , and to sharing in meals ( including the Lord 's Supper ) , and to prayer .
44:2:043:0	A deep sense of awe came over them all , and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders .
44:2:044:0	And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had .
44:2:045:0	They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need .
44:2:046:0	They worshiped together at the Temple each day , met in homes for the Lord 's Supper , and shared their meals with great joy and generosity —
44:2:047:0	all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people . And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved .
