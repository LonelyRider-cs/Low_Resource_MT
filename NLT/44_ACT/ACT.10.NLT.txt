44:10:001:1	Cornelius Calls for Peter
44:10:001:0	In Caesarea there lived a Roman army officer named Cornelius , who was a captain of the Italian Regiment .
44:10:002:0	He was a devout , God-fearing man , as was everyone in his household . He gave generously to the poor and prayed regularly to God .
44:10:003:0	One afternoon about three o'clock , he had a vision in which he saw an angel of God coming toward him . “ Cornelius ! ” the angel said .
44:10:004:0	Cornelius stared at him in terror . “ What is it , sir ? ” he asked the angel.And the angel replied , “ Your prayers and gifts to the poor have been received by God as an offering !
44:10:005:0	Now send some men to Joppa , and summon a man named Simon Peter .
44:10:006:0	He is staying with Simon , a tanner who lives near the seashore . ”
44:10:007:0	As soon as the angel was gone , Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier , one of his personal attendants .
44:10:002:1	Peter Visits Cornelius
44:10:008:0	He told them what had happened and sent them off to Joppa .
44:10:009:0	The next day as Cornelius 's messengers were nearing the town , Peter went up on the flat roof to pray . It was about noon ,
44:10:010:0	and he was hungry . But while a meal was being prepared , he fell into a trance .
44:10:011:0	He saw the sky open , and something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners .
44:10:012:0	In the sheet were all sorts of animals , reptiles , and birds .
44:10:013:0	Then a voice said to him , “ Get up , Peter ; kill and eat them . ”
44:10:014:0	“ No , Lord , ” Peter declared . “ I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure and unclean . ”
44:10:015:0	But the voice spoke again : “ Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean . ”
44:10:016:0	The same vision was repeated three times . Then the sheet was suddenly pulled up to heaven .
44:10:017:0	Peter was very perplexed . What could the vision mean ? Just then the men sent by Cornelius found Simon 's house . Standing outside the gate ,
44:10:018:0	they asked if a man named Simon Peter was staying there .
44:10:019:0	Meanwhile , as Peter was puzzling over the vision , the Holy Spirit said to him , “ Three men have come looking for you .
44:10:020:0	Get up , go downstairs , and go with them without hesitation . Do n't worry , for I have sent them . ”
44:10:021:0	So Peter went down and said , “ I 'm the man you are looking for . Why have you come ? ”
44:10:022:0	They said , “ We were sent by Cornelius , a Roman officer . He is a devout and God-fearing man , well respected by all the Jews . A holy angel instructed him to summon you to his house so that he can hear your message . ”
44:10:023:0	So Peter invited the men to stay for the night . The next day he went with them , accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa .
44:10:024:0	They arrived in Caesarea the following day . Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44:10:025:0	As Peter entered his home , Cornelius fell at his feet and worshiped him .
44:10:026:0	But Peter pulled him up and said , “ Stand up ! I 'm a human being just like you ! ”
44:10:027:0	So they talked together and went inside , where many others were assembled .
44:10:028:0	Peter told them , “ You know it is against our laws for a Jewish man to enter a Gentile home like this or to associate with you . But God has shown me that I should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean .
44:10:029:0	So I came without objection as soon as I was sent for . Now tell me why you sent for me . ”
44:10:030:0	Cornelius replied , “ Four days ago I was praying in my house about this same time , three o'clock in the afternoon . Suddenly , a man in dazzling clothes was standing in front of me .
44:10:031:0	He told me , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard , and your gifts to the poor have been noticed by God !
44:10:032:0	Now send messengers to Joppa , and summon a man named Simon Peter . He is staying in the home of Simon , a tanner who lives near the seashore . '
44:10:003:1	The Gentiles Hear the Good News
44:10:033:0	So I sent for you at once , and it was good of you to come . Now we are all here , waiting before God to hear the message the Lord has given you . ”
44:10:034:0	Then Peter replied , “ I see very clearly that God shows no favoritism .
44:10:035:0	In every nation he accepts those who fear him and do what is right .
44:10:036:0	This is the message of Good News for the people of Israel—that there is peace with God through Jesus Christ , who is Lord of all .
44:10:037:0	You know what happened throughout Judea , beginning in Galilee , after John began preaching his message of baptism .
44:10:038:0	And you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power . Then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
44:10:039:0	“ And we apostles are witnesses of all he did throughout Judea and in Jerusalem . They put him to death by hanging him on a cross ,
44:10:040:0	but God raised him to life on the third day . Then God allowed him to appear ,
44:10:041:0	not to the general public , but to us whom God had chosen in advance to be his witnesses . We were those who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
44:10:042:0	And he ordered us to preach everywhere and to testify that Jesus is the one appointed by God to be the judge of all—the living and the dead .
44:10:004:1	The Gentiles Receive the Holy Spirit
44:10:043:0	He is the one all the prophets testified about , saying that everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name . ”
44:10:044:0	Even as Peter was saying these things , the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message .
44:10:045:0	The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles , too .
44:10:046:0	For they heard them speaking in other tongues and praising God.Then Peter asked ,
44:10:047:0	“ Can anyone object to their being baptized , now that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we did ? ”
44:10:048:0	So he gave orders for them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Afterward Cornelius asked him to stay with them for several days .
