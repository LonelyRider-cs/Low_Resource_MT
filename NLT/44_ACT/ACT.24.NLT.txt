44:24:001:1	Paul Appears before Felix
44:24:001:0	Five days later Ananias , the high priest , arrived with some of the Jewish elders and the lawyer Tertullus , to present their case against Paul to the governor .
44:24:002:0	When Paul was called in , Tertullus presented the charges against Paul in the following address to the governor : “ You have provided a long period of peace for us Jews and with foresight have enacted reforms for us .
44:24:003:0	For all of this , Your Excellency , we are very grateful to you .
44:24:004:0	But I do n't want to bore you , so please give me your attention for only a moment .
44:24:005:0	We have found this man to be a troublemaker who is constantly stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world . He is a ringleader of the cult known as the Nazarenes .
44:24:006:0	Furthermore , he was trying to desecrate the Temple when we arrested him .
44:24:008:0	You can find out the truth of our accusations by examining him yourself . ”
44:24:009:0	Then the other Jews chimed in , declaring that everything Tertullus said was true .
44:24:010:0	The governor then motioned for Paul to speak . Paul said , “ I know , sir , that you have been a judge of Jewish affairs for many years , so I gladly present my defense before you .
44:24:011:0	You can quickly discover that I arrived in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago to worship at the Temple .
44:24:012:0	My accusers never found me arguing with anyone in the Temple , nor stirring up a riot in any synagogue or on the streets of the city .
44:24:013:0	These men can not prove the things they accuse me of doing .
44:24:014:0	“ But I admit that I follow the Way , which they call a cult . I worship the God of our ancestors , and I firmly believe the Jewish law and everything written in the prophets .
44:24:015:0	I have the same hope in God that these men have , that he will raise both the righteous and the unrighteous .
44:24:016:0	Because of this , I always try to maintain a clear conscience before God and all people .
44:24:017:0	“ After several years away , I returned to Jerusalem with money to aid my people and to offer sacrifices to God .
44:24:018:0	My accusers saw me in the Temple as I was completing a purification ceremony . There was no crowd around me and no rioting .
44:24:019:0	But some Jews from the province of Asia were there — and they ought to be here to bring charges if they have anything against me !
44:24:020:0	Ask these men here what crime the Jewish high council found me guilty of ,
44:24:021:0	except for the one time I shouted out , ‘ I am on trial before you today because I believe in the resurrection of the dead ! ' ”
44:24:022:0	At that point Felix , who was quite familiar with the Way , adjourned the hearing and said , “ Wait until Lysias , the garrison commander , arrives . Then I will decide the case . ”
44:24:023:0	He ordered an officer to keep Paul in custody but to give him some freedom and allow his friends to visit him and take care of his needs .
44:24:024:0	A few days later Felix came back with his wife , Drusilla , who was Jewish . Sending for Paul , they listened as he told them about faith in Christ Jesus .
44:24:025:0	As he reasoned with them about righteousness and self-control and the coming day of judgment , Felix became frightened . “ Go away for now , ” he replied . “ When it is more convenient , I 'll call for you again . ”
44:24:026:0	He also hoped that Paul would bribe him , so he sent for him quite often and talked with him .
44:24:027:0	After two years went by in this way , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus . And because Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jewish people , he left Paul in prison .
