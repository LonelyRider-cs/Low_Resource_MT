44:14:001:1	Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
44:14:001:0	The same thing happened in Iconium . Paul and Barnabas went to the Jewish synagogue and preached with such power that a great number of both Jews and Greeks became believers .
44:14:002:0	Some of the Jews , however , spurned God 's message and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas .
44:14:003:0	But the apostles stayed there a long time , preaching boldly about the grace of the Lord . And the Lord proved their message was true by giving them power to do miraculous signs and wonders .
44:14:004:0	But the people of the town were divided in their opinion about them . Some sided with the Jews , and some with the apostles .
44:14:005:0	Then a mob of Gentiles and Jews , along with their leaders , decided to attack and stone them .
44:14:006:0	When the apostles learned of it , they fled to the region of Lycaonia—to the towns of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding area .
44:14:002:1	Paul and Barnabas in Lystra and Derbe
44:14:007:0	And there they preached the Good News .
44:14:008:0	While they were at Lystra , Paul and Barnabas came upon a man with crippled feet . He had been that way from birth , so he had never walked . He was sitting
44:14:009:0	and listening as Paul preached . Looking straight at him , Paul realized he had faith to be healed .
44:14:010:0	So Paul called to him in a loud voice , “ Stand up ! ” And the man jumped to his feet and started walking .
44:14:011:0	When the crowd saw what Paul had done , they shouted in their local dialect , “ These men are gods in human form ! ”
44:14:012:0	They decided that Barnabas was the Greek god Zeus and that Paul was Hermes , since he was the chief speaker .
44:14:013:0	Now the temple of Zeus was located just outside the town . So the priest of the temple and the crowd brought bulls and wreaths of flowers to the town gates , and they prepared to offer sacrifices to the apostles .
44:14:014:0	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard what was happening , they tore their clothing in dismay and ran out among the people , shouting ,
44:14:015:0	“ Friends , why are you doing this ? We are merely human beings—just like you ! We have come to bring you the Good News that you should turn from these worthless things and turn to the living God , who made heaven and earth , the sea , and everything in them .
44:14:016:0	In the past he permitted all the nations to go their own ways ,
44:14:017:0	but he never left them without evidence of himself and his goodness . For instance , he sends you rain and good crops and gives you food and joyful hearts . ”
44:14:018:0	But even with these words , Paul and Barnabas could scarcely restrain the people from sacrificing to them .
44:14:019:0	Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds to their side . They stoned Paul and dragged him out of town , thinking he was dead .
44:14:003:1	Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch of Syria
44:14:020:0	But as the believers gathered around him , he got up and went back into the town . The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe .
44:14:021:0	After preaching the Good News in Derbe and making many disciples , Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch of Pisidia ,
44:14:022:0	where they strengthened the believers . They encouraged them to continue in the faith , reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God .
44:14:023:0	Paul and Barnabas also appointed elders in every church . With prayer and fasting , they turned the elders over to the care of the Lord , in whom they had put their trust .
44:14:024:0	Then they traveled back through Pisidia to Pamphylia .
44:14:025:0	They preached the word in Perga , then went down to Attalia .
44:14:026:0	Finally , they returned by ship to Antioch of Syria , where their journey had begun . The believers there had entrusted them to the grace of God to do the work they had now completed .
44:14:027:0	Upon arriving in Antioch , they called the church together and reported everything God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles , too .
44:14:028:0	And they stayed there with the believers for a long time .
