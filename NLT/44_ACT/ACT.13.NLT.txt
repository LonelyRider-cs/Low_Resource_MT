44:13:001:1	Barnabas and Saul Are Commissioned
44:13:001:0	Among the prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch of Syria were Barnabas , Simeon ( called “ the black man ” ) , Lucius ( from Cyrene ) , Manaen ( the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas ) , and Saul .
44:13:002:0	One day as these men were worshiping the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , “ Appoint Barnabas and Saul for the special work to which I have called them . ”
44:13:002:1	Paul 's First Missionary Journey
44:13:003:0	So after more fasting and prayer , the men laid their hands on them and sent them on their way .
44:13:004:0	So Barnabas and Saul were sent out by the Holy Spirit . They went down to the seaport of Seleucia and then sailed for the island of Cyprus .
44:13:005:0	There , in the town of Salamis , they went to the Jewish synagogues and preached the word of God . John Mark went with them as their assistant .
44:13:006:0	Afterward they traveled from town to town across the entire island until finally they reached Paphos , where they met a Jewish sorcerer , a false prophet named Bar-Jesus .
44:13:007:0	He had attached himself to the governor , Sergius Paulus , who was an intelligent man . The governor invited Barnabas and Saul to visit him , for he wanted to hear the word of God .
44:13:008:0	But Elymas , the sorcerer ( as his name means in Greek ) , interfered and urged the governor to pay no attention to what Barnabas and Saul said . He was trying to keep the governor from believing .
44:13:009:0	Saul , also known as Paul , was filled with the Holy Spirit , and he looked the sorcerer in the eye .
44:13:010:0	Then he said , “ You son of the devil , full of every sort of deceit and fraud , and enemy of all that is good ! Will you never stop perverting the true ways of the Lord ?
44:13:011:0	Watch now , for the Lord has laid his hand of punishment upon you , and you will be struck blind . You will not see the sunlight for some time. ” Instantly mist and darkness came over the man 's eyes , and he began groping around begging for someone to take his hand and lead him .
44:13:003:1	Paul Preaches in Antioch of Pisidia
44:13:012:0	When the governor saw what had happened , he became a believer , for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord .
44:13:013:0	Paul and his companions then left Paphos by ship for Pamphylia , landing at the port town of Perga . There John Mark left them and returned to Jerusalem .
44:13:014:0	But Paul and Barnabas traveled inland to Antioch of Pisidia.On the Sabbath they went to the synagogue for the services .
44:13:015:0	After the usual readings from the books of Moses and the prophets , those in charge of the service sent them this message : “ Brothers , if you have any word of encouragement for the people , come and give it . ”
44:13:016:0	So Paul stood , lifted his hand to quiet them , and started speaking . “ Men of Israel , ” he said , “ and you God-fearing Gentiles , listen to me .
44:13:017:0	“ The God of this nation of Israel chose our ancestors and made them multiply and grow strong during their stay in Egypt . Then with a powerful arm he led them out of their slavery .
44:13:018:0	He put up with them through forty years of wandering in the wilderness .
44:13:019:0	Then he destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to Israel as an inheritance .
44:13:020:0	All this took about 450 years. “ After that , God gave them judges to rule until the time of Samuel the prophet .
44:13:021:0	Then the people begged for a king , and God gave them Saul son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , who reigned for forty years .
44:13:022:0	But God removed Saul and replaced him with David , a man about whom God said , ‘ I have found David son of Jesse , a man after my own heart . He will do everything I want him to do . '
44:13:023:0	“ And it is one of King David 's descendants , Jesus , who is God 's promised Savior of Israel !
44:13:024:0	Before he came , John the Baptist preached that all the people of Israel needed to repent of their sins and turn to God and be baptized .
44:13:025:0	As John was finishing his ministry he asked , ‘ Do you think I am the Messiah ? No , I am not ! But he is coming soon—and I 'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the sandals on his feet . '
44:13:026:0	“ Brothers—you sons of Abraham , and also you God-fearing Gentiles—this message of salvation has been sent to us !
44:13:027:0	The people in Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize Jesus as the one the prophets had spoken about . Instead , they condemned him , and in doing this they fulfilled the prophets ' words that are read every Sabbath .
44:13:028:0	They found no legal reason to execute him , but they asked Pilate to have him killed anyway .
44:13:029:0	“ When they had done all that the prophecies said about him , they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb .
44:13:030:0	But God raised him from the dead !
44:13:031:0	And over a period of many days he appeared to those who had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem . They are now his witnesses to the people of Israel .
44:13:032:0	“ And now we are here to bring you this Good News . The promise was made to our ancestors ,
44:13:033:0	and God has now fulfilled it for us , their descendants , by raising Jesus . This is what the second psalm says about Jesus : ‘ You are my Son.Today I have become your Father . '
44:13:034:0	For God had promised to raise him from the dead , not leaving him to rot in the grave . He said , ‘ I will give you the sacred blessings I promised to David . '
44:13:035:0	Another psalm explains it more fully : ‘ You will not allow your Holy One to rot in the grave . '
44:13:036:0	This is not a reference to David , for after David had done the will of God in his own generation , he died and was buried with his ancestors , and his body decayed .
44:13:037:0	No , it was a reference to someone else—someone whom God raised and whose body did not decay .
44:13:038:0	“ Brothers , listen ! We are here to proclaim that through this man Jesus there is forgiveness for your sins .
44:13:039:0	Everyone who believes in him is made right in God 's sight—something the law of Moses could never do .
44:13:040:0	Be careful ! Do n't let the prophets ' words apply to you . For they said ,
44:13:041:0	‘ Look , you mockers , be amazed and die ! For I am doing something in your own day , something you would n't believeeven if someone told you about it . ' ”
44:13:042:0	As Paul and Barnabas left the synagogue that day , the people begged them to speak about these things again the next week .
44:13:004:1	Paul Turns to the Gentiles
44:13:043:0	Many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas , and the two men urged them to continue to rely on the grace of God .
44:13:044:0	The following week almost the entire city turned out to hear them preach the word of the Lord .
44:13:045:0	But when some of the Jews saw the crowds , they were jealous ; so they slandered Paul and argued against whatever he said .
44:13:046:0	Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and declared , “ It was necessary that we first preach the word of God to you Jews . But since you have rejected it and judged yourselves unworthy of eternal life , we will offer it to the Gentiles .
44:13:047:0	For the Lord gave us this command when he said , ‘ I have made you a light to the Gentiles , to bring salvation to the farthest corners of the earth . ' ”
44:13:048:0	When the Gentiles heard this , they were very glad and thanked the Lord for his message ; and all who were chosen for eternal life became believers .
44:13:049:0	So the Lord 's message spread throughout that region .
44:13:050:0	Then the Jews stirred up the influential religious women and the leaders of the city , and they incited a mob against Paul and Barnabas and ran them out of town .
44:13:051:0	So they shook the dust from their feet as a sign of rejection and went to the town of Iconium .
44:13:052:0	And the believers were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
