39:2:001:1	A Warning to the Priests
39:2:001:0	“ Listen , you priests — this command is for you !
39:2:002:0	Listen to me and make up your minds to honor my name , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , “ or I will bring a terrible curse against you . I will curse even the blessings you receive . Indeed , I have already cursed them , because you have not taken my warning to heart .
39:2:003:0	I will punish your descendants and splatter your faces with the manure from your festival sacrifices , and I will throw you on the manure pile .
39:2:004:0	Then at last you will know it was I who sent you this warning so that my covenant with the Levites can continue , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:2:005:0	“ The purpose of my covenant with the Levites was to bring life and peace , and that is what I gave them . This required reverence from them , and they greatly revered me and stood in awe of my name .
39:2:006:0	They passed on to the people the truth of the instructions they received from me . They did not lie or cheat ; they walked with me , living good and righteous lives , and they turned many from lives of sin .
39:2:007:0	“ The words of a priest 's lips should preserve knowledge of God , and people should go to him for instruction , for the priest is the messenger of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:2:008:0	But you priests have left God 's paths . Your instructions have caused many to stumble into sin . You have corrupted the covenant I made with the Levites , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:2:002:1	A Call to Faithfulness
39:2:009:0	“ So I have made you despised and humiliated in the eyes of all the people . For you have not obeyed me but have shown favoritism in the way you carry out my instructions . ”
39:2:010:0	Are we not all children of the same Father ? Are we not all created by the same God ? Then why do we betray each other , violating the covenant of our ancestors ?
39:2:011:0	Judah has been unfaithful , and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem . The men of Judah have defiled the Lord 's beloved sanctuary by marrying women who worship idols .
39:2:012:0	May the Lord cut off from the nation of Israel every last man who has done this and yet brings an offering to the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:2:013:0	Here is another thing you do . You cover the Lord 's altar with tears , weeping and groaning because he pays no attention to your offerings and does n't accept them with pleasure .
39:2:014:0	You cry out , “ Why does n't the Lord accept my worship ? ” I 'll tell you why ! Because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young . But you have been unfaithful to her , though she remained your faithful partner , the wife of your marriage vows .
39:2:015:0	Did n't the Lord make you one with your wife ? In body and spirit you are his . And what does he want ? Godly children from your union . So guard your heart ; remain loyal to the wife of your youth .
39:2:016:0	“ For I hate divorce ! ” says the Lord , the God of Israel . “ To divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . “ So guard your heart ; do not be unfaithful to your wife . ”
39:2:017:0	You have wearied the Lord with your words. “ How have we wearied him ? ” you ask.You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the Lord 's sight , and he is pleased with them . You have wearied him by asking , “ Where is the God of justice ? ”
