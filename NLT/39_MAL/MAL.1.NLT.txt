39:1:001:1	The
39:1:002:1	Lord
39:1:003:1	's Love for Israel
39:1:001:0	This is the message that the Lord gave to Israel through the prophet Malachi .
39:1:002:0	“ I have always loved you , ” says the Lord.But you retort , “ Really ? How have you loved us ? ” And the Lord replies , “ This is how I showed my love for you : I loved your ancestor Jacob ,
39:1:003:0	but I rejected his brother , Esau , and devastated his hill country . I turned Esau 's inheritance into a desert for jackals . ”
39:1:004:0	Esau 's descendants in Edom may say , “ We have been shattered , but we will rebuild the ruins. ” But the Lord of Heaven 's Armies replies , “ They may try to rebuild , but I will demolish them again . Their country will be known as ‘ The Land of Wickedness , ' and their people will be called ‘ The People with Whom the Lord Is Forever Angry . '
39:1:004:1	Unworthy Sacrifices
39:1:005:0	When you see the destruction for yourselves , you will say , ‘ Truly , the Lord 's greatness reaches far beyond Israel 's borders ! ' ”
39:1:006:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies says to the priests : “ A son honors his father , and a servant respects his master . If I am your father and master , where are the honor and respect I deserve ? You have shown contempt for my name ! “ But you ask , ‘ How have we ever shown contempt for your name ? '
39:1:007:0	“ You have shown contempt by offering defiled sacrifices on my altar. “ Then you ask , ‘ How have we defiled the sacrifices ? ' “ You defile them by saying the altar of the Lord deserves no respect .
39:1:008:0	When you give blind animals as sacrifices , is n't that wrong ? And is n't it wrong to offer animals that are crippled and diseased ? Try giving gifts like that to your governor , and see how pleased he is ! ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:1:009:0	“ Go ahead , beg God to be merciful to you ! But when you bring that kind of offering , why should he show you any favor at all ? ” asks the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:1:010:0	“ How I wish one of you would shut the Temple doors so that these worthless sacrifices could not be offered ! I am not pleased with you , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , “ and I will not accept your offerings .
39:1:011:0	But my name is honored by people of other nations from morning till night . All around the world they offer sweet incense and pure offerings in honor of my name . For my name is great among the nations , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
39:1:012:0	“ But you dishonor my name with your actions . By bringing contemptible food , you are saying it 's all right to defile the Lord 's table .
39:1:013:0	You say , ‘ It 's too hard to serve the Lord , ' and you turn up your noses at my commands , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . “ Think of it ! Animals that are stolen and crippled and sick are being presented as offerings ! Should I accept from you such offerings as these ? ” asks the Lord .
39:1:014:0	“ Cursed is the cheat who promises to give a fine ram from his flock but then sacrifices a defective one to the Lord . For I am a great king , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , “ and my name is feared among the nations !
