29:1:001:1	Mourning over the Locust Plague
29:1:001:0	The Lord gave this message to Joel son of Pethuel .
29:1:002:0	Hear this , you leaders of the people.Listen , all who live in the land.In all your history , has anything like this happened before ?
29:1:003:0	Tell your children about it in the years to come , and let your children tell their children.Pass the story down from generation to generation .
29:1:004:0	After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops , the swarming locusts took what was left ! After them came the hopping locusts , and then the stripping locusts , too !
29:1:005:0	Wake up , you drunkards , and weep ! Wail , all you wine-drinkers ! All the grapes are ruined , and all your sweet wine is gone .
29:1:006:0	A vast army of locusts has invaded my land , a terrible army too numerous to count.Its teeth are like lions ' teeth , its fangs like those of a lioness .
29:1:007:0	It has destroyed my grapevinesand ruined my fig trees , stripping their bark and destroying it , leaving the branches white and bare .
29:1:008:0	Weep like a bride dressed in black , mourning the death of her husband .
29:1:009:0	For there is no grain or wineto offer at the Temple of the Lord.So the priests are in mourning.The ministers of the Lord are weeping .
29:1:010:0	The fields are ruined , the land is stripped bare.The grain is destroyed , the grapes have shriveled , and the olive oil is gone .
29:1:011:0	Despair , all you farmers ! Wail , all you vine growers ! Weep , because the wheat and barley — all the crops of the field — are ruined .
29:1:012:0	The grapevines have dried up , and the fig trees have withered.The pomegranate trees , palm trees , and apple trees — all the fruit trees — have dried up.And the people 's joy has dried up with them .
29:1:013:0	Dress yourselves in burlap and weep , you priests ! Wail , you who serve before the altar ! Come , spend the night in burlap , you ministers of my God.For there is no grain or wineto offer at the Temple of your God .
29:1:014:0	Announce a time of fasting ; call the people together for a solemn meeting.Bring the leadersand all the people of the landinto the Temple of the Lord your God , and cry out to him there .
29:1:015:0	The day of the Lord is near , the day when destruction comes from the Almighty.How terrible that day will be !
29:1:016:0	Our food disappears before our very eyes.No joyful celebrations are held in the house of our God .
29:1:017:0	The seeds die in the parched ground , and the grain crops fail.The barns stand empty , and granaries are abandoned .
29:1:018:0	How the animals moan with hunger ! The herds of cattle wander about confused , because they have no pasture.The flocks of sheep and goats bleat in misery .
29:1:019:0	Lord , help us ! The fire has consumed the wilderness pastures , and flames have burned up all the trees .
29:1:020:0	Even the wild animals cry out to youbecause the streams have dried up , and fire has consumed the wilderness pastures .
