29:3:001:1	Judgment against Enemy Nations
29:3:001:0	“ At the time of those events , ” says the Lord , “ when I restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem ,
29:3:002:0	I will gather the armies of the worldinto the valley of Jehoshaphat.There I will judge themfor harming my people , my special possession , for scattering my people among the nations , and for dividing up my land .
29:3:003:0	They threw dice to decide which of my peoplewould be their slaves.They traded boys to obtain prostitutesand sold girls for enough wine to get drunk .
29:3:004:0	“ What do you have against me , Tyre and Sidon and you cities of Philistia ? Are you trying to take revenge on me ? If you are , then watch out ! I will strike swiftly and pay you back for everything you have done .
29:3:005:0	You have taken my silver and gold and all my precious treasures , and have carried them off to your pagan temples .
29:3:006:0	You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks , so they could take them far from their homeland .
29:3:007:0	“ But I will bring them back from all the places to which you sold them , and I will pay you back for everything you have done .
29:3:008:0	I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah , and they will sell them to the people of Arabia , a nation far away . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
29:3:009:0	Say to the nations far and wide : “ Get ready for war ! Call out your best warriors.Let all your fighting men advance for the attack .
29:3:010:0	Hammer your plowshares into swordsand your pruning hooks into spears.Train even your weaklings to be warriors .
29:3:011:0	Come quickly , all you nations everywhere.Gather together in the valley. ” And now , O Lord , call out your warriors !
29:3:012:0	“ Let the nations be called to arms.Let them march to the valley of Jehoshaphat.There I , the Lord , will sitto pronounce judgment on them all .
29:3:013:0	Swing the sickle , for the harvest is ripe.Come , tread the grapes , for the winepress is full.The storage vats are overflowingwith the wickedness of these people . ”
29:3:014:0	Thousands upon thousands are waiting in the valley of decision.There the day of the Lord will soon arrive .
29:3:015:0	The sun and moon will grow dark , and the stars will no longer shine .
29:3:002:1	Blessings for God 's People
29:3:016:0	The Lord 's voice will roar from Zionand thunder from Jerusalem , and the heavens and the earth will shake.But the Lord will be a refuge for his people , a strong fortress for the people of Israel .
29:3:017:0	“ Then you will know that I , the Lord your God , live in Zion , my holy mountain.Jerusalem will be holy forever , and foreign armies will never conquer her again .
29:3:018:0	In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine , and the hills will flow with milk.Water will fill the streambeds of Judah , and a fountain will burst forth from the Lord 's Temple , watering the arid valley of acacias .
29:3:019:0	But Egypt will become a wastelandand Edom will become a wilderness , because they attacked the people of Judahand killed innocent people in their land .
29:3:020:0	“ But Judah will be filled with people forever , and Jerusalem will endure through all generations .
29:3:021:0	I will pardon my people 's crimes , which I have not yet pardoned ; and I , the Lord , will make my homein Jerusalem with my people . ”
