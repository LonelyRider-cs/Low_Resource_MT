29:2:001:1	Locusts Invade like an Army
29:2:001:0	Sound the trumpet in Jerusalem ! Raise the alarm on my holy mountain ! Let everyone tremble in fearbecause the day of the Lord is upon us .
29:2:002:0	It is a day of darkness and gloom , a day of thick clouds and deep blackness.Suddenly , like dawn spreading across the mountains , a great and mighty army appears.Nothing like it has been seen beforeor will ever be seen again .
29:2:003:0	Fire burns in front of them , and flames follow after them.Ahead of them the land liesas beautiful as the Garden of Eden.Behind them is nothing but desolation ; not one thing escapes .
29:2:004:0	They look like horses ; they charge forward like warhorses .
29:2:005:0	Look at them as they leap along the mountaintops.Listen to the noise they make—like the rumbling of chariots , like the roar of fire sweeping across a field of stubble , or like a mighty army moving into battle .
29:2:006:0	Fear grips all the people ; every face grows pale with terror .
29:2:007:0	The attackers march like warriorsand scale city walls like soldiers.Straight forward they march , never breaking rank .
29:2:008:0	They never jostle each other ; each moves in exactly the right position.They break through defenseswithout missing a step .
29:2:009:0	They swarm over the cityand run along its walls.They enter all the houses , climbing like thieves through the windows .
29:2:010:0	The earth quakes as they advance , and the heavens tremble.The sun and moon grow dark , and the stars no longer shine .
29:2:002:1	A Call to Repentance
29:2:011:0	The Lord is at the head of the column.He leads them with a shout.This is his mighty army , and they follow his orders.The day of the Lord is an awesome , terrible thing.Who can possibly survive ?
29:2:012:0	That is why the Lord says , “ Turn to me now , while there is time.Give me your hearts.Come with fasting , weeping , and mourning .
29:2:013:0	Do n't tear your clothing in your grief , but tear your hearts instead. ” Return to the Lord your God , for he is merciful and compassionate , slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.He is eager to relent and not punish .
29:2:014:0	Who knows ? Perhaps he will give you a reprieve , sending you a blessing instead of this curse.Perhaps you will be able to offer grain and wineto the Lord your God as before .
29:2:015:0	Blow the ram 's horn in Jerusalem ! Announce a time of fasting ; call the people togetherfor a solemn meeting .
29:2:016:0	Gather all the people—the elders , the children , and even the babies.Call the bridegroom from his quartersand the bride from her private room .
29:2:003:1	The
29:2:004:1	Lord
29:2:005:1	's Promise of Restoration
29:2:017:0	Let the priests , who minister in the Lord 's presence , stand and weep between the entry room to the Temple and the altar.Let them pray , “ Spare your people , Lord ! Do n't let your special possession become an object of mockery.Do n't let them become a joke for unbelieving foreigners who say , ‘ Has the God of Israel left them ? ' ”
29:2:018:0	Then the Lord will pity his peopleand jealously guard the honor of his land .
29:2:019:0	The Lord will reply , “ Look ! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive oil , enough to satisfy your needs.You will no longer be an object of mockeryamong the surrounding nations .
29:2:020:0	I will drive away these armies from the north.I will send them into the parched wastelands.Those in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea , and those at the rear into the Mediterranean.The stench of their rotting bodies will rise over the land. ” Surely the Lord has done great things !
29:2:021:0	Do n't be afraid , O land.Be glad now and rejoice , for the Lord has done great things .
29:2:022:0	Do n't be afraid , you animals of the field , for the wilderness pastures will soon be green.The trees will again be filled with fruit ; fig trees and grapevines will be loaded down once more .
29:2:023:0	Rejoice , you people of Jerusalem ! Rejoice in the Lord your God ! For the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness.Once more the autumn rains will come , as well as the rains of spring .
29:2:024:0	The threshing floors will again be piled high with grain , and the presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil .
29:2:025:0	The Lord says , “ I will give you back what you lostto the swarming locusts , the hopping locusts , the stripping locusts , and the cutting locusts.It was I who sent this great destroying army against you .
29:2:026:0	Once again you will have all the food you want , and you will praise the Lord your God , who does these miracles for you.Never again will my people be disgraced .
29:2:006:1	The
29:2:007:1	Lord
29:2:008:1	's Promise of His Spirit
29:2:027:0	Then you will know that I am among my people Israel , that I am the Lord your God , and there is no other.Never again will my people be disgraced .
29:2:028:0	“ Then , after doing all those things , I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.Your sons and daughters will prophesy.Your old men will dream dreams , and your young men will see visions .
29:2:029:0	In those days I will pour out my Spiriteven on servants—men and women alike .
29:2:030:0	And I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth—blood and fire and columns of smoke .
29:2:031:0	The sun will become dark , and the moon will turn blood redbefore that great and terrible day of the Lord arrives .
29:2:032:0	But everyone who calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved , for some on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will escape , just as the Lord has said.These will be among the survivorswhom the Lord has called .
