4:14:001:1	The People Rebel
4:14:001:0	Then the whole community began weeping aloud , and they cried all night .
4:14:002:0	Their voices rose in a great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron . “ If only we had died in Egypt , or even here in the wilderness ! ” they complained .
4:14:003:0	“ Why is the Lord taking us to this country only to have us die in battle ? Our wives and our little ones will be carried off as plunder ! Would n't it be better for us to return to Egypt ? ”
4:14:004:0	Then they plotted among themselves , “ Let 's choose a new leader and go back to Egypt ! ”
4:14:005:0	Then Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground before the whole community of Israel .
4:14:006:0	Two of the men who had explored the land , Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh , tore their clothing .
4:14:007:0	They said to all the people of Israel , “ The land we traveled through and explored is a wonderful land !
4:14:008:0	And if the Lord is pleased with us , he will bring us safely into that land and give it to us . It is a rich land flowing with milk and honey .
4:14:009:0	Do not rebel against the Lord , and do n't be afraid of the people of the land . They are only helpless prey to us ! They have no protection , but the Lord is with us ! Do n't be afraid of them ! ”
4:14:010:0	But the whole community began to talk about stoning Joshua and Caleb . Then the glorious presence of the Lord appeared to all the Israelites at the Tabernacle .
4:14:011:0	And the Lord said to Moses , “ How long will these people treat me with contempt ? Will they never believe me , even after all the miraculous signs I have done among them ?
4:14:002:1	Moses Intercedes for the People
4:14:012:0	I will disown them and destroy them with a plague . Then I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are ! ”
4:14:013:0	But Moses objected . “ What will the Egyptians think when they hear about it ? ” he asked the Lord . “ They know full well the power you displayed in rescuing your people from Egypt .
4:14:014:0	Now if you destroy them , the Egyptians will send a report to the inhabitants of this land , who have already heard that you live among your people . They know , Lord , that you have appeared to your people face to face and that your pillar of cloud hovers over them . They know that you go before them in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night .
4:14:015:0	Now if you slaughter all these people with a single blow , the nations that have heard of your fame will say ,
4:14:016:0	‘ The Lord was not able to bring them into the land he swore to give them , so he killed them in the wilderness . '
4:14:017:0	“ Please , Lord , prove that your power is as great as you have claimed . For you said ,
4:14:018:0	‘ The Lord is slow to anger and filled with unfailing love , forgiving every kind of sin and rebellion . But he does not excuse the guilty . He lays the sins of the parents upon their children ; the entire family is affected—even children in the third and fourth generations . '
4:14:019:0	In keeping with your magnificent , unfailing love , please pardon the sins of this people , just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt . ”
4:14:020:0	Then the Lord said , “ I will pardon them as you have requested .
4:14:021:0	But as surely as I live , and as surely as the earth is filled with the Lord 's glory ,
4:14:022:0	not one of these people will ever enter that land . They have all seen my glorious presence and the miraculous signs I performed both in Egypt and in the wilderness , but again and again they have tested me by refusing to listen to my voice .
4:14:023:0	They will never even see the land I swore to give their ancestors . None of those who have treated me with contempt will ever see it .
4:14:024:0	But my servant Caleb has a different attitude than the others have . He has remained loyal to me , so I will bring him into the land he explored . His descendants will possess their full share of that land .
4:14:003:1	The
4:14:004:1	Lord
4:14:005:1	Punishes the Israelites
4:14:025:0	Now turn around , and do n't go on toward the land where the Amalekites and Canaanites live . Tomorrow you must set out for the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea . ”
4:14:026:0	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
4:14:027:0	“ How long must I put up with this wicked community and its complaints about me ? Yes , I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making against me .
4:14:028:0	Now tell them this : ‘ As surely as I live , declares the Lord , I will do to you the very things I heard you say .
4:14:029:0	You will all drop dead in this wilderness ! Because you complained against me , every one of you who is twenty years old or older and was included in the registration will die .
4:14:030:0	You will not enter and occupy the land I swore to give you . The only exceptions will be Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun .
4:14:031:0	“ ‘ You said your children would be carried off as plunder . Well , I will bring them safely into the land , and they will enjoy what you have despised .
4:14:032:0	But as for you , you will drop dead in this wilderness .
4:14:033:0	And your children will be like shepherds , wandering in the wilderness for forty years . In this way , they will pay for your faithlessness , until the last of you lies dead in the wilderness .
4:14:034:0	“ ‘ Because your men explored the land for forty days , you must wander in the wilderness for forty years—a year for each day , suffering the consequences of your sins . Then you will discover what it is like to have me for an enemy . '
4:14:035:0	I , the Lord , have spoken ! I will certainly do these things to every member of the community who has conspired against me . They will be destroyed here in this wilderness , and here they will die ! ”
4:14:036:0	The ten men Moses had sent to explore the land—the ones who incited rebellion against the Lord with their bad report—
4:14:037:0	were struck dead with a plague before the Lord .
4:14:038:0	Of the twelve who had explored the land , only Joshua and Caleb remained alive .
4:14:039:0	When Moses reported the Lord 's words to all the Israelites , the people were filled with grief .
4:14:040:0	Then they got up early the next morning and went to the top of the range of hills . “ Let 's go , ” they said . “ We realize that we have sinned , but now we are ready to enter the land the Lord has promised us . ”
4:14:041:0	But Moses said , “ Why are you now disobeying the Lord 's orders to return to the wilderness ? It wo n't work .
4:14:042:0	Do not go up into the land now . You will only be crushed by your enemies because the Lord is not with you .
4:14:043:0	When you face the Amalekites and Canaanites in battle , you will be slaughtered . The Lord will abandon you because you have abandoned the Lord . ”
4:14:044:0	But the people defiantly pushed ahead toward the hill country , even though neither Moses nor the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant left the camp .
4:14:045:0	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in those hills came down and attacked them and chased them back as far as Hormah .
