4:30:001:1	Laws concerning Vows
4:30:001:0	Then Moses summoned the leaders of the tribes of Israel and told them , “ This is what the Lord has commanded :
4:30:002:0	A man who makes a vow to the Lord or makes a pledge under oath must never break it . He must do exactly what he said he would do .
4:30:003:0	“ If a young woman makes a vow to the Lord or a pledge under oath while she is still living at her father 's home ,
4:30:004:0	and her father hears of the vow or pledge and does not object to it , then all her vows and pledges will stand .
4:30:005:0	But if her father refuses to let her fulfill the vow or pledge on the day he hears of it , then all her vows and pledges will become invalid . The Lord will forgive her because her father would not let her fulfill them .
4:30:006:0	“ Now suppose a young woman makes a vow or binds herself with an impulsive pledge and later marries .
4:30:007:0	If her husband learns of her vow or pledge and does not object on the day he hears of it , her vows and pledges will stand .
4:30:008:0	But if her husband refuses to accept her vow or impulsive pledge on the day he hears of it , he nullifies her commitments , and the Lord will forgive her .
4:30:009:0	If , however , a woman is a widow or is divorced , she must fulfill all her vows and pledges .
4:30:010:0	“ But suppose a woman is married and living in her husband 's home when she makes a vow or binds herself with a pledge .
4:30:011:0	If her husband hears of it and does not object to it , her vow or pledge will stand .
4:30:012:0	But if her husband refuses to accept it on the day he hears of it , her vow or pledge will be nullified , and the Lord will forgive her .
4:30:013:0	So her husband may either confirm or nullify any vows or pledges she makes to deny herself .
4:30:014:0	But if he does not object on the day he hears of it , then he is agreeing to all her vows and pledges .
4:30:015:0	If he waits more than a day and then tries to nullify a vow or pledge , he will be punished for her guilt . ”
4:30:016:0	These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife , and between a father and a young daughter who still lives at home .
