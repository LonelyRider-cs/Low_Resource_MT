4:23:001:1	Balaam Blesses Israel
4:23:001:0	Then Balaam said to King Balak , “ Build me seven altars here , and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice . ”
4:23:002:0	Balak followed his instructions , and the two of them sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar .
4:23:003:0	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Stand here by your burnt offerings , and I will go to see if the Lord will respond to me . Then I will tell you whatever he reveals to me. ” So Balaam went alone to the top of a bare hill ,
4:23:004:0	and God met him there . Balaam said to him , “ I have prepared seven altars and have sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar . ”
4:23:005:0	The Lord gave Balaam a message for King Balak . Then he said , “ Go back to Balak and give him my message . ”
4:23:006:0	So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab .
4:23:007:0	This was the message Balaam delivered : “ Balak summoned me to come from Aram ; the king of Moab brought me from the eastern hills. ‘ Come , ' he said , ‘ curse Jacob for me ! Come and announce Israel 's doom . '
4:23:008:0	But how can I curse thosewhom God has not cursed ? How can I condemn thosewhom the Lord has not condemned ?
4:23:009:0	I see them from the cliff tops ; I watch them from the hills.I see a people who live by themselves , set apart from other nations .
4:23:010:0	Who can count Jacob 's descendants , as numerous as dust ? Who can count even a fourth of Israel 's people ? Let me die like the righteous ; let my life end like theirs . ”
4:23:011:0	Then King Balak demanded of Balaam , “ What have you done to me ? I brought you to curse my enemies . Instead , you have blessed them ! ”
4:23:002:1	Balaam 's Second Message
4:23:012:0	But Balaam replied , “ I will speak only the message that the Lord puts in my mouth . ”
4:23:013:0	Then King Balak told him , “ Come with me to another place . There you will see another part of the nation of Israel , but not all of them . Curse at least that many ! ”
4:23:014:0	So Balak took Balaam to the plateau of Zophim on Pisgah Peak . He built seven altars there and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar .
4:23:015:0	Then Balaam said to the king , “ Stand here by your burnt offerings while I go over there to meet the Lord . ”
4:23:016:0	And the Lord met Balaam and gave him a message . Then he said , “ Go back to Balak and give him my message . ”
4:23:017:0	So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab . “ What did the Lord say ? ” Balak asked eagerly .
4:23:018:0	This was the message Balaam delivered : “ Rise up , Balak , and listen ! Hear me , son of Zippor .
4:23:019:0	God is not a man , so he does not lie.He is not human , so he does not change his mind.Has he ever spoken and failed to act ? Has he ever promised and not carried it through ?
4:23:020:0	Listen , I received a command to bless ; God has blessed , and I can not reverse it !
4:23:021:0	No misfortune is in his plan for Jacob ; no trouble is in store for Israel.For the Lord their God is with them ; he has been proclaimed their king .
4:23:022:0	God brought them out of Egypt ; for them he is as strong as a wild ox .
4:23:023:0	No curse can touch Jacob ; no magic has any power against Israel.For now it will be said of Jacob , ‘ What wonders God has done for Israel ! '
4:23:024:0	These people rise up like a lioness , like a majestic lion rousing itself.They refuse to restuntil they have feasted on prey , drinking the blood of the slaughtered ! ”
4:23:025:0	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Fine , but if you wo n't curse them , at least do n't bless them ! ”
4:23:003:1	Balaam 's Third Message
4:23:026:0	But Balaam replied to Balak , “ Did n't I tell you that I can do only what the Lord tells me ? ”
4:23:027:0	Then King Balak said to Balaam , “ Come , I will take you to one more place . Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them from there . ”
4:23:028:0	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor , overlooking the wasteland .
4:23:029:0	Balaam again told Balak , “ Build me seven altars , and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice . ”
4:23:030:0	So Balak did as Balaam ordered and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar .
