4:4:017:0	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
4:4:018:0	“ Do not let the Kohathite clans be destroyed from among the Levites !
4:4:019:0	This is what you must do so they will live and not die when they approach the most sacred objects . Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and assign a specific duty or load to each person .
