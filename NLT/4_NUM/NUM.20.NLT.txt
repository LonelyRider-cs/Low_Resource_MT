4:20:001:1	Moses Strikes the Rock
4:20:001:0	In the first month of the year , the whole community of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh . While they were there , Miriam died and was buried .
4:20:002:0	There was no water for the people to drink at that place , so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron .
4:20:003:0	The people blamed Moses and said , “ If only we had died in the Lord 's presence with our brothers !
4:20:004:0	Why have you brought the congregation of the Lord 's people into this wilderness to die , along with all our livestock ?
4:20:005:0	Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this terrible place ? This land has no grain , no figs , no grapes , no pomegranates , and no water to drink ! ”
4:20:006:0	Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Tabernacle , where they fell face down on the ground . Then the glorious presence of the Lord appeared to them ,
4:20:007:0	and the Lord said to Moses ,
4:20:008:0	“ You and Aaron must take the staff and assemble the entire community . As the people watch , speak to the rock over there , and it will pour out its water . You will provide enough water from the rock to satisfy the whole community and their livestock . ”
4:20:009:0	So Moses did as he was told . He took the staff from the place where it was kept before the Lord .
4:20:010:0	Then he and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock . “ Listen , you rebels ! ” he shouted . “ Must we bring you water from this rock ? ”
4:20:011:0	Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the staff , and water gushed out . So the entire community and their livestock drank their fill .
4:20:012:0	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Because you did not trust me enough to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel , you will not lead them into the land I am giving them ! ”
4:20:002:1	Edom Refuses Israel Passage
4:20:013:0	This place was known as the waters of Meribah ( which means “ arguing ” ) because there the people of Israel argued with the Lord , and there he demonstrated his holiness among them .
4:20:014:0	While Moses was at Kadesh , he sent ambassadors to the king of Edom with this message : “ This is what your relatives , the people of Israel , say : You know all the hardships we have been through .
4:20:015:0	Our ancestors went down to Egypt , and we lived there a long time , and we and our ancestors were brutally mistreated by the Egyptians .
4:20:016:0	But when we cried out to the Lord , he heard us and sent an angel who brought us out of Egypt . Now we are camped at Kadesh , a town on the border of your land .
4:20:017:0	Please let us travel through your land . We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards . We wo n't even drink water from your wells . We will stay on the king 's road and never leave it until we have passed through your territory . ”
4:20:018:0	But the king of Edom said , “ Stay out of my land , or I will meet you with an army ! ”
4:20:019:0	The Israelites answered , “ We will stay on the main road . If our livestock drink your water , we will pay for it . Just let us pass through your country . That 's all we ask . ”
4:20:020:0	But the king of Edom replied , “ Stay out ! You may not pass through our land. ” With that he mobilized his army and marched out against them with an imposing force .
4:20:003:1	The Death of Aaron
4:20:021:0	Because Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their country , Israel was forced to turn around .
4:20:022:0	The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor .
4:20:023:0	There , on the border of the land of Edom , the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
4:20:024:0	“ The time has come for Aaron to join his ancestors in death . He will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel , because the two of you rebelled against my instructions concerning the water at Meribah .
4:20:025:0	Now take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor .
4:20:026:0	There you will remove Aaron 's priestly garments and put them on Eleazar , his son . Aaron will die there and join his ancestors . ”
4:20:027:0	So Moses did as the Lord commanded . The three of them went up Mount Hor together as the whole community watched .
4:20:028:0	At the summit , Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on Eleazar , Aaron 's son . Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain , and Moses and Eleazar went back down .
4:20:029:0	When the people realized that Aaron had died , all Israel mourned for him thirty days .
