4:32:001:1	The Tribes East of the Jordan
4:32:001:0	The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned vast numbers of livestock . So when they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideally suited for their flocks and herds ,
4:32:002:0	they came to Moses , Eleazar the priest , and the other leaders of the community . They said ,
4:32:003:0	“ Notice the towns of Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sibmah , Nebo , and Beon .
4:32:004:0	The Lord has conquered this whole area for the community of Israel , and it is ideally suited for all our livestock .
4:32:005:0	If we have found favor with you , please let us have this land as our property instead of giving us land across the Jordan River . ”
4:32:006:0	“ Do you intend to stay here while your brothers go across and do all the fighting ? ” Moses asked the men of Gad and Reuben .
4:32:007:0	“ Why do you want to discourage the rest of the people of Israel from going across to the land the Lord has given them ?
4:32:008:0	Your ancestors did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land .
4:32:009:0	After they went up to the valley of Eshcol and explored the land , they discouraged the people of Israel from entering the land the Lord was giving them .
4:32:010:0	Then the Lord was very angry with them , and he vowed ,
4:32:011:0	‘ Of all those I rescued from Egypt , no one who is twenty years old or older will ever see the land I swore to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , for they have not obeyed me wholeheartedly .
4:32:012:0	The only exceptions are Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun , for they have wholeheartedly followed the Lord . '
4:32:013:0	“ The Lord was angry with Israel and made them wander in the wilderness for forty years until the entire generation that sinned in the Lord 's sight had died .
4:32:014:0	But here you are , a brood of sinners , doing exactly the same thing ! You are making the Lord even angrier with Israel .
4:32:015:0	If you turn away from him like this and he abandons them again in the wilderness , you will be responsible for destroying this entire nation ! ”
4:32:016:0	But they approached Moses and said , “ We simply want to build pens for our livestock and fortified towns for our wives and children .
4:32:017:0	Then we will arm ourselves and lead our fellow Israelites into battle until we have brought them safely to their land . Meanwhile , our families will stay in the fortified towns we build here , so they will be safe from any attacks by the local people .
4:32:018:0	We will not return to our homes until all the people of Israel have received their portions of land .
4:32:019:0	But we do not claim any of the land on the other side of the Jordan . We would rather live here on the east side and accept this as our grant of land . ”
4:32:020:0	Then Moses said , “ If you keep your word and arm yourselves for the Lord 's battles ,
4:32:021:0	and if your troops cross the Jordan and keep fighting until the Lord has driven out his enemies ,
4:32:022:0	then you may return when the Lord has conquered the land . You will have fulfilled your duty to the Lord and to the rest of the people of Israel . And the land on the east side of the Jordan will be your property from the Lord .
4:32:023:0	But if you fail to keep your word , then you will have sinned against the Lord , and you may be sure that your sin will find you out .
4:32:024:0	Go ahead and build towns for your families and pens for your flocks , but do everything you have promised . ”
4:32:025:0	Then the men of Gad and Reuben replied , “ We , your servants , will follow your instructions exactly .
4:32:026:0	Our children , wives , flocks , and cattle will stay here in the towns of Gilead .
4:32:027:0	But all who are able to bear arms will cross over to fight for the Lord , just as you have said . ”
4:32:028:0	So Moses gave orders to Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and the leaders of the clans of Israel .
4:32:029:0	He said , “ The men of Gad and Reuben who are armed for battle must cross the Jordan with you to fight for the Lord . If they do , give them the land of Gilead as their property when the land is conquered .
4:32:030:0	But if they refuse to arm themselves and cross over with you , then they must accept land with the rest of you in the land of Canaan . ”
4:32:031:0	The tribes of Gad and Reuben said again , “ We are your servants , and we will do as the Lord has commanded !
4:32:032:0	We will cross the Jordan into Canaan fully armed to fight for the Lord , but our property will be here on this side of the Jordan . ”
4:32:033:0	So Moses assigned land to the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph . He gave them the territory of King Sihon of the Amorites and the land of King Og of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and surrounding lands .
4:32:034:0	The descendants of Gad built the towns of Dibon , Ataroth , Aroer ,
4:32:035:0	Atroth-shophan , Jazer , Jogbehah ,
4:32:036:0	Beth-nimrah , and Beth-haran . These were all fortified towns with pens for their flocks .
4:32:037:0	The descendants of Reuben built the towns of Heshbon , Elealeh , Kiriathaim ,
4:32:038:0	Nebo , Baal-meon , and Sibmah . They changed the names of some of the towns they conquered and rebuilt .
4:32:039:0	Then the descendants of Makir of the tribe of Manasseh went to Gilead and conquered it , and they drove out the Amorites living there .
4:32:040:0	So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites , descendants of Manasseh , and they settled there .
4:32:041:0	The people of Jair , another clan of the tribe of Manasseh , captured many of the towns in Gilead and changed the name of that region to the Towns of Jair .
4:32:042:0	Meanwhile , a man named Nobah captured the town of Kenath and its surrounding villages , and he renamed that area Nobah after himself .
