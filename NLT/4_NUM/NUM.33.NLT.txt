4:33:050:0	While they were camped near the Jordan River on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho , the Lord said to Moses ,
4:33:051:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel : When you cross the Jordan River into the land of Canaan ,
4:33:052:0	you must drive out all the people living there . You must destroy all their carved and molten images and demolish all their pagan shrines .
4:33:053:0	Take possession of the land and settle in it , because I have given it to you to occupy .
4:33:054:0	You must distribute the land among the clans by sacred lot and in proportion to their size . A larger portion of land will be allotted to each of the larger clans , and a smaller portion will be allotted to each of the smaller clans . The decision of the sacred lot is final . In this way , the portions of land will be divided among your ancestral tribes .
4:33:055:0	But if you fail to drive out the people who live in the land , those who remain will be like splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides . They will harass you in the land where you live .
4:33:056:0	And I will do to you what I had planned to do to them . ”
