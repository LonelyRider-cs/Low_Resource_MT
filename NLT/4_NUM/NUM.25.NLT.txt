4:25:001:1	Moab Seduces Israel
4:25:001:0	While the Israelites were camped at Acacia Grove , some of the men defiled themselves by having sexual relations with local Moabite women .
4:25:002:0	These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods , so the Israelites feasted with them and worshiped the gods of Moab .
4:25:003:0	In this way , Israel joined in the worship of Baal of Peor , causing the Lord 's anger to blaze against his people .
4:25:004:0	The Lord issued the following command to Moses : “ Seize all the ringleaders and execute them before the Lord in broad daylight , so his fierce anger will turn away from the people of Israel . ”
4:25:005:0	So Moses ordered Israel 's judges , “ Each of you must put to death the men under your authority who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor . ”
4:25:006:0	Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into his tent , right before the eyes of Moses and all the people , as everyone was weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
4:25:007:0	When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this , he jumped up and left the assembly . He took a spear
4:25:008:0	and rushed after the man into his tent . Phinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man 's body and into the woman 's stomach . So the plague against the Israelites was stopped ,
4:25:009:0	but not before 24,000 people had died .
4:25:010:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:25:011:0	“ Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest has turned my anger away from the Israelites by being as zealous among them as I was . So I stopped destroying all Israel as I had intended to do in my zealous anger .
4:25:012:0	Now tell him that I am making my special covenant of peace with him .
4:25:013:0	In this covenant , I give him and his descendants a permanent right to the priesthood , for in his zeal for me , his God , he purified the people of Israel , making them right with me . ”
4:25:014:0	The Israelite man killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son of Salu , the leader of a family from the tribe of Simeon .
4:25:015:0	The woman 's name was Cozbi ; she was the daughter of Zur , the leader of a Midianite clan .
4:25:016:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:25:017:0	“ Attack the Midianites and destroy them ,
4:25:018:0	because they assaulted you with deceit and tricked you into worshiping Baal of Peor , and because of Cozbi , the daughter of a Midianite leader , who was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor . ”
