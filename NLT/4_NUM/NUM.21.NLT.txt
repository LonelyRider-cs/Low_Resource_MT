4:21:001:1	Victory over the Canaanites
4:21:001:0	The Canaanite king of Arad , who lived in the Negev , heard that the Israelites were approaching on the road through Atharim . So he attacked the Israelites and took some of them as prisoners .
4:21:002:0	Then the people of Israel made this vow to the Lord : “ If you will hand these people over to us , we will completely destroy all their towns . ”
4:21:002:1	The Bronze Snake
4:21:003:0	The Lord heard the Israelites ' request and gave them victory over the Canaanites . The Israelites completely destroyed them and their towns , and the place has been called Hormah ever since .
4:21:004:0	Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor , taking the road to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom . But the people grew impatient with the long journey ,
4:21:005:0	and they began to speak against God and Moses . “ Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness ? ” they complained . “ There is nothing to eat here and nothing to drink . And we hate this horrible manna ! ”
4:21:006:0	So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people , and many were bitten and died .
4:21:007:0	Then the people came to Moses and cried out , “ We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you . Pray that the Lord will take away the snakes. ” So Moses prayed for the people .
4:21:008:0	Then the Lord told him , “ Make a replica of a poisonous snake and attach it to a pole . All who are bitten will live if they simply look at it ! ”
4:21:003:1	Israel 's Journey to Moab
4:21:009:0	So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole . Then anyone who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed !
4:21:010:0	The Israelites traveled next to Oboth and camped there .
4:21:011:0	Then they went on to Iye-abarim , in the wilderness on the eastern border of Moab .
4:21:012:0	From there they traveled to the valley of Zered Brook and set up camp .
4:21:013:0	Then they moved out and camped on the far side of the Arnon River , in the wilderness adjacent to the territory of the Amorites . The Arnon is the boundary line between the Moabites and the Amorites .
4:21:014:0	For this reason The Book of the Wars of the speaks of “ the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah , and the ravines of the Arnon River ,
4:21:015:0	and the ravines that extend as far as the settlement of Ar on the border of Moab . ”
4:21:016:0	From there the Israelites traveled to Beer , which is the well where the Lord said to Moses , “ Assemble the people , and I will give them water . ”
4:21:017:0	There the Israelites sang this song : “ Spring up , O well ! Yes , sing its praises !
4:21:018:0	Sing of this well , which princes dug , which great leaders hollowed outwith their scepters and staffs. ” Then the Israelites left the wilderness and proceeded on through Mattanah ,
4:21:019:0	Nahaliel , and Bamoth .
4:21:004:1	Victory over Sihon and Og
4:21:020:0	After that they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Peak overlooks the wasteland .
4:21:021:0	The Israelites sent ambassadors to King Sihon of the Amorites with this message :
4:21:022:0	“ Let us travel through your land . We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards . We wo n't even drink water from your wells . We will stay on the king 's road until we have passed through your territory . ”
4:21:023:0	But King Sihon refused to let them cross his territory . Instead , he mobilized his entire army and attacked Israel in the wilderness , engaging them in battle at Jahaz .
4:21:024:0	But the Israelites slaughtered them with their swords and occupied their land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River . They went only as far as the Ammonite border because the boundary of the Ammonites was fortified .
4:21:025:0	So Israel captured all the towns of the Amorites and settled in them , including the city of Heshbon and its surrounding villages .
4:21:026:0	Heshbon had been the capital of King Sihon of the Amorites . He had defeated a former Moabite king and seized all his land as far as the Arnon River .
4:21:027:0	Therefore , the ancient poets wrote this about him : “ Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt ! Let the city of Sihon be restored .
4:21:028:0	A fire flamed forth from Heshbon , a blaze from the city of Sihon.It burned the city of Ar in Moab ; it destroyed the rulers of the Arnon heights .
4:21:029:0	What sorrow awaits you , O people of Moab ! You are finished , O worshipers of Chemosh ! Chemosh has left his sons as refugees , his daughters as captives of Sihon , the Amorite king .
4:21:030:0	We have utterly destroyed them , from Heshbon to Dibon.We have completely wiped them outas far away as Nophah and Medeba . ”
4:21:031:0	So the people of Israel occupied the territory of the Amorites .
4:21:032:0	After Moses sent men to explore the Jazer area , they captured all the towns in the region and drove out the Amorites who lived there .
4:21:033:0	Then they turned and marched up the road to Bashan , but King Og of Bashan and all his people attacked them at Edrei .
4:21:034:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ Do not be afraid of him , for I have handed him over to you , along with all his people and his land . Do the same to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites , who ruled in Heshbon . ”
4:21:035:0	And Israel killed King Og , his sons , and all his subjects ; not a single survivor remained . Then Israel occupied their land .
