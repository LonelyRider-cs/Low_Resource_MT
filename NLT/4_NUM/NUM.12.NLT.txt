4:12:001:1	The Complaints of Miriam and Aaron
4:12:001:0	While they were at Hazeroth , Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he had married a Cushite woman .
4:12:002:0	They said , “ Has the Lord spoken only through Moses ? Has n't he spoken through us , too ? ” But the Lord heard them .
4:12:003:0	( Now Moses was very humble—more humble than any other person on earth . )
4:12:004:0	So immediately the Lord called to Moses , Aaron , and Miriam and said , “ Go out to the Tabernacle , all three of you ! ” So the three of them went to the Tabernacle .
4:12:005:0	Then the Lord descended in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle . “ Aaron and Miriam ! ” he called , and they stepped forward .
4:12:006:0	And the Lord said to them , “ Now listen to what I say : “ If there were prophets among you , I , the Lord , would reveal myself in visions.I would speak to them in dreams .
4:12:007:0	But not with my servant Moses.Of all my house , he is the one I trust .
4:12:008:0	I speak to him face to face , clearly , and not in riddles ! He sees the Lord as he is.So why were you not afraidto criticize my servant Moses ? ”
4:12:009:0	The Lord was very angry with them , and he departed .
4:12:010:0	As the cloud moved from above the Tabernacle , there stood Miriam , her skin as white as snow from leprosy . When Aaron saw what had happened to her ,
4:12:011:0	he cried out to Moses , “ Oh , my master ! Please do n't punish us for this sin we have so foolishly committed .
4:12:012:0	Do n't let her be like a stillborn baby , already decayed at birth . ”
4:12:013:0	So Moses cried out to the Lord , “ O God , I beg you , please heal her ! ”
4:12:014:0	But the Lord said to Moses , “ If her father had done nothing more than spit in her face , would n't she be defiled for seven days ? So keep her outside the camp for seven days , and after that she may be accepted back . ”
4:12:015:0	So Miriam was kept outside the camp for seven days , and the people waited until she was brought back before they traveled again .
4:12:016:0	Then they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran .
