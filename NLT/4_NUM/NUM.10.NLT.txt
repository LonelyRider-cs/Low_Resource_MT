4:10:001:1	The Silver Trumpets
4:10:001:0	Now the Lord said to Moses ,
4:10:002:0	“ Make two trumpets of hammered silver for calling the community to assemble and for signaling the breaking of camp .
4:10:003:0	When both trumpets are blown , everyone must gather before you at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
4:10:004:0	But if only one trumpet is blown , then only the leaders — the heads of the clans of Israel — must present themselves to you .
4:10:005:0	“ When you sound the signal to move on , the tribes camped on the east side of the Tabernacle must break camp and move forward .
4:10:006:0	When you sound the signal a second time , the tribes camped on the south will follow . You must sound short blasts as the signal for moving on .
4:10:007:0	But when you call the people to an assembly , blow the trumpets with a different signal .
4:10:008:0	Only the priests , Aaron 's descendants , are allowed to blow the trumpets . This is a permanent law for you , to be observed from generation to generation .
4:10:009:0	“ When you arrive in your own land and go to war against your enemies who attack you , sound the alarm with the trumpets . Then the Lord your God will remember you and rescue you from your enemies .
4:10:002:1	The Israelites Leave Sinai
4:10:010:0	Blow the trumpets in times of gladness , too , sounding them at your annual festivals and at the beginning of each month . And blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and peace offerings . The trumpets will remind your God of his covenant with you . I am the Lord your God . ”
4:10:011:0	In the second year after Israel 's departure from Egypt — on the twentieth day of the second month — the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle of the Covenant .
4:10:012:0	So the Israelites set out from the wilderness of Sinai and traveled on from place to place until the cloud stopped in the wilderness of Paran .
4:10:013:0	When the people set out for the first time , following the instructions the Lord had given through Moses ,
4:10:014:0	Judah 's troops led the way . They marched behind their banner , and their leader was Nahshon son of Amminadab .
4:10:015:0	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Issachar , led by Nethanel son of Zuar ,
4:10:016:0	and the troops of the tribe of Zebulun , led by Eliab son of Helon .
4:10:017:0	Then the Tabernacle was taken down , and the Gershonite and Merarite divisions of the Levites were next in the line of march , carrying the Tabernacle with them .
4:10:018:0	Reuben 's troops went next , marching behind their banner . Their leader was Elizur son of Shedeur .
4:10:019:0	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Simeon , led by Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai ,
4:10:020:0	and the troops of the tribe of Gad , led by Eliasaph son of Deuel .
4:10:021:0	Next came the Kohathite division of the Levites , carrying the sacred objects from the Tabernacle . Before they arrived at the next camp , the Tabernacle would already be set up at its new location .
4:10:022:0	Ephraim 's troops went next , marching behind their banner . Their leader was Elishama son of Ammihud .
4:10:023:0	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Manasseh , led by Gamaliel son of Pedahzur ,
4:10:024:0	and the troops of the tribe of Benjamin , led by Abidan son of Gideoni .
4:10:025:0	Dan 's troops went last , marching behind their banner and serving as the rear guard for all the tribal camps . Their leader was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai .
4:10:026:0	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Asher , led by Pagiel son of Ocran ,
4:10:027:0	and the troops of the tribe of Naphtali , led by Ahira son of Enan .
4:10:028:0	This was the order in which the Israelites marched , division by division .
4:10:029:0	One day Moses said to his brother-in-law , Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite , “ We are on our way to the place the Lord promised us , for he said , ‘ I will give it to you . ' Come with us and we will treat you well , for the Lord has promised wonderful blessings for Israel ! ”
4:10:030:0	But Hobab replied , “ No , I will not go . I must return to my own land and family . ”
4:10:031:0	“ Please do n't leave us , ” Moses pleaded . “ You know the places in the wilderness where we should camp . Come , be our guide .
4:10:032:0	If you do , we 'll share with you all the blessings the Lord gives us . ”
4:10:033:0	They marched for three days after leaving the mountain of the Lord , with the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant moving ahead of them to show them where to stop and rest .
4:10:034:0	As they moved on each day , the cloud of the Lord hovered over them .
4:10:035:0	And whenever the Ark set out , Moses would shout , “ Arise , O Lord , and let your enemies be scattered ! Let them flee before you ! ”
4:10:036:0	And when the Ark was set down , he would say , “ Return , O Lord , to the countless thousands of Israel ! ”
