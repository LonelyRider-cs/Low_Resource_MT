4:36:001:1	Women Who Inherit Property
4:36:001:0	Then the heads of the clans of Gilead — descendants of Makir , son of Manasseh , son of Joseph — came to Moses and the family leaders of Israel with a petition .
4:36:002:0	They said , “ Sir , the Lord instructed you to divide the land by sacred lot among the people of Israel . You were told by the Lord to give the grant of land owned by our brother Zelophehad to his daughters .
4:36:003:0	But if they marry men from another tribe , their grants of land will go with them to the tribe into which they marry . In this way , the total area of our tribal land will be reduced .
4:36:004:0	Then when the Year of Jubilee comes , their portion of land will be added to that of the new tribe , causing it to be lost forever to our ancestral tribe . ”
4:36:005:0	So Moses gave the Israelites this command from the Lord : “ The claim of the men of the tribe of Joseph is legitimate .
4:36:006:0	This is what the Lord commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad : Let them marry anyone they like , as long as it is within their own ancestral tribe .
4:36:007:0	None of the territorial land may pass from tribe to tribe , for all the land given to each tribe must remain within the tribe to which it was first allotted .
4:36:008:0	The daughters throughout the tribes of Israel who are in line to inherit property must marry within their tribe , so that all the Israelites will keep their ancestral property .
4:36:009:0	No grant of land may pass from one tribe to another ; each tribe of Israel must keep its allotted portion of land . ”
4:36:010:0	The daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord commanded Moses .
4:36:011:0	Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah all married cousins on their father 's side .
4:36:012:0	They married into the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph . Thus , their inheritance of land remained within their ancestral tribe .
4:36:013:0	These are the commands and regulations that the Lord gave to the people of Israel through Moses while they were camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River , across from Jericho .
