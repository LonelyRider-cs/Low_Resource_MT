4:17:001:1	The Budding of Aaron 's Staff
4:17:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:17:002:0	“ Tell the people of Israel to bring you twelve wooden staffs , one from each leader of Israel 's ancestral tribes , and inscribe each leader 's name on his staff .
4:17:003:0	Inscribe Aaron 's name on the staff of the tribe of Levi , for there must be one staff for the leader of each ancestral tribe .
4:17:004:0	Place these staffs in the Tabernacle in front of the Ark containing the tablets of the Covenant , where I meet with you .
4:17:005:0	Buds will sprout on the staff belonging to the man I choose . Then I will finally put an end to the people 's murmuring and complaining against you . ”
4:17:006:0	So Moses gave the instructions to the people of Israel , and each of the twelve tribal leaders , including Aaron , brought Moses a staff .
4:17:007:0	Moses placed the staffs in the Lord 's presence in the Tabernacle of the Covenant .
4:17:008:0	When he went into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the next day , he found that Aaron 's staff , representing the tribe of Levi , had sprouted , budded , blossomed , and produced ripe almonds !
4:17:009:0	When Moses brought all the staffs out from the Lord 's presence , he showed them to the people . Each man claimed his own staff .
4:17:010:0	And the Lord said to Moses : “ Place Aaron 's staff permanently before the Ark of the Covenant to serve as a warning to rebels . This should put an end to their complaints against me and prevent any further deaths . ”
4:17:011:0	So Moses did as the Lord commanded him .
4:17:012:0	Then the people of Israel said to Moses , “ Look , we are doomed ! We are dead ! We are ruined !
4:17:013:0	Everyone who even comes close to the Tabernacle of the Lord dies . Are we all doomed to die ? ”
