4:15:001:1	Laws concerning Offerings
4:15:001:0	Then the Lord told Moses ,
4:15:002:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. “ When you finally settle in the land I am giving you ,
4:15:003:0	you will offer special gifts as a pleasing aroma to the Lord . These gifts may take the form of a burnt offering , a sacrifice to fulfill a vow , a voluntary offering , or an offering at any of your annual festivals , and they may be taken from your herds of cattle or your flocks of sheep and goats .
4:15:004:0	When you present these offerings , you must also give the Lord a grain offering of two quarts of choice flour mixed with one quart of olive oil .
4:15:005:0	For each lamb offered as a burnt offering or a special sacrifice , you must also present one quart of wine as a liquid offering .
4:15:006:0	“ If the sacrifice is a ram , give a grain offering of four quarts of choice flour mixed with a third of a gallon of olive oil ,
4:15:007:0	and give a third of a gallon of wine as a liquid offering . This will be a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
4:15:008:0	“ When you present a young bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the Lord ,
4:15:009:0	you must also give a grain offering of six quarts of choice flour mixed with two quarts of olive oil ,
4:15:010:0	and give two quarts of wine as a liquid offering . This will be a special gift , a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
4:15:011:0	“ Each sacrifice of a bull , ram , lamb , or young goat should be prepared in this way .
4:15:012:0	Follow these instructions with each offering you present .
4:15:013:0	All of you native-born Israelites must follow these instructions when you offer a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
4:15:014:0	And if any foreigners visit you or live among you and want to present a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the Lord , they must follow these same procedures .
4:15:015:0	Native-born Israelites and foreigners are equal before the Lord and are subject to the same decrees . This is a permanent law for you , to be observed from generation to generation .
4:15:016:0	The same instructions and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigners living among you . ”
4:15:017:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:15:018:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. “ When you arrive in the land where I am taking you ,
4:15:019:0	and you eat the crops that grow there , you must set some aside as a sacred offering to the Lord .
4:15:020:0	Present a cake from the first of the flour you grind , and set it aside as a sacred offering , as you do with the first grain from the threshing floor .
4:15:021:0	Throughout the generations to come , you are to present a sacred offering to the Lord each year from the first of your ground flour .
4:15:022:0	“ But suppose you unintentionally fail to carry out all these commands that the Lord has given you through Moses .
4:15:023:0	And suppose your descendants in the future fail to do everything the Lord has commanded through Moses .
4:15:024:0	If the mistake was made unintentionally , and the community was unaware of it , the whole community must present a young bull for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the Lord . It must be offered along with its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering and with one male goat for a sin offering .
4:15:025:0	With it the priest will purify the whole community of Israel , making them right with the Lord , and they will be forgiven . For it was an unintentional sin , and they have corrected it with their offerings to the Lord—the special gift and the sin offering .
4:15:026:0	The whole community of Israel will be forgiven , including the foreigners living among you , for all the people were involved in the sin .
4:15:027:0	“ If one individual commits an unintentional sin , the guilty person must bring a one-year-old female goat for a sin offering .
4:15:028:0	The priest will sacrifice it to purify the guilty person before the Lord , and that person will be forgiven .
4:15:029:0	These same instructions apply both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you .
4:15:030:0	“ But those who brazenly violate the Lord 's will , whether native-born Israelites or foreigners , have blasphemed the Lord , and they must be cut off from the community .
4:15:002:1	Penalty for Breaking the Sabbath
4:15:031:0	Since they have treated the Lord 's word with contempt and deliberately disobeyed his command , they must be completely cut off and suffer the punishment for their guilt . ”
4:15:032:0	One day while the people of Israel were in the wilderness , they discovered a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day .
4:15:033:0	The people who found him doing this took him before Moses , Aaron , and the rest of the community .
4:15:034:0	They held him in custody because they did not know what to do with him .
4:15:035:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ The man must be put to death ! The whole community must stone him outside the camp . ”
4:15:003:1	Tassels on Clothing
4:15:036:0	So the whole community took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:15:037:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:15:038:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel : Throughout the generations to come you must make tassels for the hems of your clothing and attach them with a blue cord .
4:15:039:0	When you see the tassels , you will remember and obey all the commands of the Lord instead of following your own desires and defiling yourselves , as you are prone to do .
4:15:040:0	The tassels will help you remember that you must obey all my commands and be holy to your God .
4:15:041:0	I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt that I might be your God . I am the Lord your God ! ”
