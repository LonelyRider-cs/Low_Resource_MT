4:31:001:1	Conquest of the Midianites
4:31:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:31:002:0	“ On behalf of the people of Israel , take revenge on the Midianites for leading them into idolatry . After that , you will die and join your ancestors . ”
4:31:003:0	So Moses said to the people , “ Choose some men , and arm them to fight the Lord 's war of revenge against Midian .
4:31:004:0	From each tribe of Israel , send 1,000 men into battle . ”
4:31:005:0	So they chose 1,000 men from each tribe of Israel , a total of 12,000 men armed for battle .
4:31:006:0	Then Moses sent them out , 1,000 men from each tribe , and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest led them into battle . They carried along the holy objects of the sanctuary and the trumpets for sounding the charge .
4:31:007:0	They attacked Midian as the Lord had commanded Moses , and they killed all the men .
4:31:008:0	All five of the Midianite kings—Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur , and Reba—died in the battle . They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword .
4:31:009:0	Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder .
4:31:010:0	They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived .
4:31:011:0	After they had gathered the plunder and captives , both people and animals ,
4:31:012:0	they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest , and to the whole community of Israel , which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River , across from Jericho .
4:31:013:0	Moses , Eleazar the priest , and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp .
4:31:014:0	But Moses was furious with all the generals and captains who had returned from the battle .
4:31:015:0	“ Why have you let all the women live ? ” he demanded .
4:31:016:0	“ These are the very ones who followed Balaam 's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the Lord at Mount Peor . They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the Lord 's people .
4:31:017:0	So kill all the boys and all the women who have had intercourse with a man .
4:31:018:0	Only the young girls who are virgins may live ; you may keep them for yourselves .
4:31:019:0	And all of you who have killed anyone or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp for seven days . You must purify yourselves and your captives on the third and seventh days .
4:31:020:0	Purify all your clothing , too , and everything made of leather , goat hair , or wood . ”
4:31:021:0	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men who were in the battle , “ The Lord has given Moses this legal requirement :
4:31:022:0	Anything made of gold , silver , bronze , iron , tin , or lead—
4:31:023:0	that is , all metals that do not burn—must be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure . These metal objects must then be further purified with the water of purification . But everything that burns must be purified by the water alone .
4:31:002:1	Division of the Plunder
4:31:024:0	On the seventh day you must wash your clothes and be purified . Then you may return to the camp . ”
4:31:025:0	And the Lord said to Moses ,
4:31:026:0	“ You and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of each tribe are to make a list of all the plunder taken in the battle , including the people and animals .
4:31:027:0	Then divide the plunder into two parts , and give half to the men who fought the battle and half to the rest of the people .
4:31:028:0	From the army 's portion , first give the Lord his share of the plunder—one of every 500 of the prisoners and of the cattle , donkeys , sheep , and goats .
4:31:029:0	Give this share of the army 's half to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the Lord .
4:31:030:0	From the half that belongs to the people of Israel , take one of every fifty of the prisoners and of the cattle , donkeys , sheep , goats , and other animals . Give this share to the Levites , who are in charge of maintaining the Lord 's Tabernacle . ”
4:31:031:0	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses .
4:31:032:0	The plunder remaining from everything the fighting men had taken totaled 675,000 sheep and goats ,
4:31:033:0	72,000 cattle ,
4:31:034:0	61,000 donkeys ,
4:31:035:0	and 32,000 virgin girls .
4:31:036:0	Half of the plunder was given to the fighting men . It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats ,
4:31:037:0	of which 675 were the Lord 's share ;
4:31:038:0	36,000 cattle , of which 72 were the Lord 's share ;
4:31:039:0	30,500 donkeys , of which 61 were the Lord 's share ;
4:31:040:0	and 16,000 virgin girls , of whom 32 were the Lord 's share .
4:31:041:0	Moses gave all the Lord 's share to Eleazar the priest , just as the Lord had directed him .
4:31:042:0	Half of the plunder belonged to the people of Israel , and Moses separated it from the half belonging to the fighting men .
4:31:043:0	It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats ,
4:31:044:0	36,000 cattle ,
4:31:045:0	30,500 donkeys ,
4:31:046:0	and 16,000 virgin girls .
4:31:047:0	From the half-share given to the people , Moses took one of every fifty prisoners and animals and gave them to the Levites , who maintained the Lord 's Tabernacle . All this was done as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:31:048:0	Then all the generals and captains came to Moses
4:31:049:0	and said , “ We , your servants , have accounted for all the men who went out to battle under our command ; not one of us is missing !
4:31:050:0	So we are presenting the items of gold we captured as an offering to the Lord from our share of the plunder—armbands , bracelets , rings , earrings , and necklaces . This will purify our lives before the Lord and make us right with him . ”
4:31:051:0	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from all the military commanders—all kinds of jewelry and crafted objects .
4:31:052:0	In all , the gold that the generals and captains presented as a gift to the Lord weighed about 420 pounds .
4:31:053:0	All the fighting men had taken some of the plunder for themselves .
4:31:054:0	So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gifts from the generals and captains and brought the gold to the Tabernacle as a reminder to the Lord that the people of Israel belong to him .
