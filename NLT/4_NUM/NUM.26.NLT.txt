4:26:014:1	Results of the Registration
4:26:050:0	These were the clans of Naphtali . Their registered troops numbered 45,400 .
4:26:051:0	In summary , the registered troops of all Israel numbered 601,730 .
4:26:052:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:26:053:0	“ Divide the land among the tribes , and distribute the grants of land in proportion to the tribes ' populations , as indicated by the number of names on the list .
4:26:054:0	Give the larger tribes more land and the smaller tribes less land , each group receiving a grant in proportion to the size of its population .

4:26:062:0	The men from the Levite clans who were one month old or older numbered 23,000 . But the Levites were not included in the registration of the rest of the people of Israel because they were not given an allotment of land when it was divided among the Israelites .

4:26:064:0	Not one person on this list had been among those listed in the previous registration taken by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai .
4:26:065:0	For the Lord had said of them , “ They will all die in the wilderness. ” Not one of them survived except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun .
