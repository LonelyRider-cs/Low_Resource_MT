4:3:001:1	Levites Appointed for Service
4:3:001:0	This is the family line of Aaron and Moses as it was recorded when the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai :
4:3:002:0	The names of Aaron 's sons were Nadab ( the oldest ) , Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
4:3:003:0	These sons of Aaron were anointed and ordained to minister as priests .
4:3:004:0	But Nadab and Abihu died in the Lord 's presence in the wilderness of Sinai when they burned before the Lord the wrong kind of fire , different than he had commanded . Since they had no sons , this left only Eleazar and Ithamar to serve as priests with their father , Aaron .
4:3:005:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:3:006:0	“ Call forward the tribe of Levi , and present them to Aaron the priest to serve as his assistants .
4:3:007:0	They will serve Aaron and the whole community , performing their sacred duties in and around the Tabernacle .
4:3:008:0	They will also maintain all the furnishings of the sacred tent , serving in the Tabernacle on behalf of all the Israelites .
4:3:009:0	Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons . They have been given from among all the people of Israel to serve as their assistants .
4:3:010:0	Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood . But any unauthorized person who goes too near the sanctuary must be put to death . ”
4:3:011:0	And the Lord said to Moses ,
4:3:012:0	“ Look , I have chosen the Levites from among the Israelites to serve as substitutes for all the firstborn sons of the people of Israel . The Levites belong to me ,
4:3:002:1	Registration of the Levites
4:3:013:0	for all the firstborn males are mine . On the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians , I set apart for myself all the firstborn in Israel , both of people and of animals . They are mine ; I am the Lord . ”
4:3:014:0	The Lord spoke again to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai . He said ,
4:3:015:0	“ Record the names of the members of the tribe of Levi by their families and clans . List every male who is one month old or older . ”
4:3:016:0	So Moses listed them , just as the Lord had commanded .
4:3:017:0	Levi had three sons , whose names were Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
4:3:018:0	The clans descended from Gershon were named after two of his descendants , Libni and Shimei .
4:3:019:0	The clans descended from Kohath were named after four of his descendants , Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel .
4:3:020:0	The clans descended from Merari were named after two of his descendants , Mahli and Mushi.These were the Levite clans , listed according to their family groups .
4:3:021:0	The descendants of Gershon were composed of the clans descended from Libni and Shimei .
4:3:022:0	There were 7,500 males one month old or older among these Gershonite clans .
4:3:023:0	They were assigned the area to the west of the Tabernacle for their camp .
4:3:024:0	The leader of the Gershonite clans was Eliasaph son of Lael .
4:3:025:0	These two clans were responsible to care for the Tabernacle , including the sacred tent with its layers of coverings , the curtain at its entrance ,
4:3:026:0	the curtains of the courtyard that surrounded the Tabernacle and altar , the curtain at the courtyard entrance , the ropes , and all the equipment related to their use .
4:3:027:0	The descendants of Kohath were composed of the clans descended from Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel .
4:3:028:0	There were 8,600 males one month old or older among these Kohathite clans . They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary ,
4:3:029:0	and they were assigned the area south of the Tabernacle for their camp .
4:3:030:0	The leader of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel .
4:3:031:0	These four clans were responsible for the care of the Ark , the table , the lampstand , the altars , the various articles used in the sanctuary , the inner curtain , and all the equipment related to their use .
4:3:032:0	Eleazar , son of Aaron the priest , was the chief administrator over all the Levites , with special responsibility for the oversight of the sanctuary .
4:3:033:0	The descendants of Merari were composed of the clans descended from Mahli and Mushi .
4:3:034:0	There were 6,200 males one month old or older among these Merarite clans .
4:3:035:0	They were assigned the area north of the Tabernacle for their camp . The leader of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail .
4:3:036:0	These two clans were responsible for the care of the frames supporting the Tabernacle , the crossbars , the pillars , the bases , and all the equipment related to their use .
4:3:037:0	They were also responsible for the posts of the courtyard and all their bases , pegs , and ropes .
4:3:038:0	The area in front of the Tabernacle , in the east toward the sunrise , was reserved for the tents of Moses and of Aaron and his sons , who had the final responsibility for the sanctuary on behalf of the people of Israel . Anyone other than a priest or Levite who went too near the sanctuary was to be put to death .
4:3:003:1	Redeeming the Firstborn Sons
4:3:039:0	When Moses and Aaron counted the Levite clans at the Lord 's command , the total number was 22,000 males one month old or older .
4:3:040:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Now count all the firstborn sons in Israel who are one month old or older , and make a list of their names .
4:3:041:0	The Levites must be reserved for me as substitutes for the firstborn sons of Israel ; I am the Lord . And the Levites ' livestock must be reserved for me as substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the whole nation of Israel . ”
4:3:042:0	So Moses counted the firstborn sons of the people of Israel , just as the Lord had commanded .
4:3:043:0	The number of firstborn sons who were one month old or older was 22,273 .
4:3:044:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:3:045:0	“ Take the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn sons of the people of Israel . And take the livestock of the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the people of Israel . The Levites belong to me ; I am the Lord .
4:3:046:0	There are 273 more firstborn sons of Israel than there are Levites . To redeem these extra firstborn sons ,
4:3:047:0	collect five pieces of silver for each of them ( each piece weighing the same as the sanctuary shekel , which equals twenty gerahs ) .
4:3:048:0	Give the silver to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the extra firstborn sons . ”
4:3:049:0	So Moses collected the silver for redeeming the firstborn sons of Israel who exceeded the number of Levites .
4:3:050:0	He collected 1,365 pieces of silver on behalf of these firstborn sons of Israel ( each piece weighing the same as the sanctuary shekel ) .
4:3:051:0	And Moses gave the silver for the redemption to Aaron and his sons , just as the Lord had commanded .
