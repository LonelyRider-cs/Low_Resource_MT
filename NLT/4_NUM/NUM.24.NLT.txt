4:24:001:0	By now Balaam realized that the Lord was determined to bless Israel , so he did not resort to divination as before . Instead , he turned and looked out toward the wilderness ,
4:24:002:0	where he saw the people of Israel camped , tribe by tribe . Then the Spirit of God came upon him ,
4:24:003:0	and this is the message he delivered : “ This is the message of Balaam son of Beor , the message of the man whose eyes see clearly ,
4:24:004:0	the message of one who hears the words of God , who sees a vision from the Almighty , who bows down with eyes wide open :
4:24:005:0	How beautiful are your tents , O Jacob ; how lovely are your homes , O Israel !
4:24:006:0	They spread before me like palm groves , like gardens by the riverside.They are like tall trees planted by the Lord , like cedars beside the waters .
4:24:007:0	Water will flow from their buckets ; their offspring have all they need.Their king will be greater than Agag ; their kingdom will be exalted .
4:24:008:0	God brought them out of Egypt ; for them he is as strong as a wild ox.He devours all the nations that oppose him , breaking their bones in pieces , shooting them with arrows .
4:24:009:0	Like a lion , Israel crouches and lies down ; like a lioness , who dares to arouse her ? Blessed is everyone who blesses you , O Israel , and cursed is everyone who curses you . ”
4:24:010:0	King Balak flew into a rage against Balaam . He angrily clapped his hands and shouted , “ I called you to curse my enemies ! Instead , you have blessed them three times .
4:24:011:0	Now get out of here ! Go back home ! I promised to reward you richly , but the Lord has kept you from your reward . ”
4:24:012:0	Balaam told Balak , “ Do n't you remember what I told your messengers ? I said ,
4:24:013:0	‘ Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold , I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the Lord . ' I told you that I could say only what the Lord says !
4:24:001:1	Balaam 's Final Messages
4:24:014:0	Now I am returning to my own people . But first let me tell you what the Israelites will do to your people in the future . ”
4:24:015:0	This is the message Balaam delivered : “ This is the message of Balaam son of Beor , the message of the man whose eyes see clearly ,
4:24:016:0	the message of one who hears the words of God , who has knowledge from the Most High , who sees a vision from the Almighty , who bows down with eyes wide open :
4:24:017:0	I see him , but not here and now.I perceive him , but far in the distant future.A star will rise from Jacob ; a scepter will emerge from Israel.It will crush the heads of Moab 's people , cracking the skulls of the people of Sheth .
4:24:018:0	Edom will be taken over , and Seir , its enemy , will be conquered , while Israel marches on in triumph .
4:24:019:0	A ruler will rise in Jacobwho will destroy the survivors of Ir . ”
4:24:020:0	Then Balaam looked over toward the people of Amalek and delivered this message : “ Amalek was the greatest of nations , but its destiny is destruction ! ”
4:24:021:0	Then he looked over toward the Kenites and delivered this message : “ Your home is secure ; your nest is set in the rocks .
4:24:022:0	But the Kenites will be destroyedwhen Assyria takes you captive . ”
4:24:023:0	Balaam concluded his messages by saying : “ Alas , who can surviveunless God has willed it ?
4:24:024:0	Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus ; they will oppress Assyria and afflict Eber , but they , too , will be utterly destroyed . ”
4:24:025:0	Then Balaam left and returned home , and Balak also went on his way .
