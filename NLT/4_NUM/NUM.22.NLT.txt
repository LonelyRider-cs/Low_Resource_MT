4:22:001:1	Balak Sends for Balaam
4:22:001:0	Then the people of Israel traveled to the plains of Moab and camped east of the Jordan River , across from Jericho .
4:22:002:0	Balak son of Zippor , the Moabite king , had seen everything the Israelites did to the Amorites .
4:22:003:0	And when the people of Moab saw how many Israelites there were , they were terrified .
4:22:004:0	The king of Moab said to the elders of Midian , “ This mob will devour everything in sight , like an ox devours grass in the field ! ” So Balak , king of Moab ,
4:22:005:0	sent messengers to call Balaam son of Beor , who was living in his native land of Pethor near the Euphrates River . His message said : “ Look , a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt . They cover the face of the earth and are threatening me .
4:22:006:0	Please come and curse these people for me because they are too powerful for me . Then perhaps I will be able to conquer them and drive them from the land . I know that blessings fall on any people you bless , and curses fall on people you curse . ”
4:22:007:0	Balak 's messengers , who were elders of Moab and Midian , set out with money to pay Balaam to place a curse upon Israel . They went to Balaam and delivered Balak 's message to him .
4:22:008:0	“ Stay here overnight , ” Balaam said . “ In the morning I will tell you whatever the Lord directs me to say. ” So the officials from Moab stayed there with Balaam .
4:22:009:0	That night God came to Balaam and asked him , “ Who are these men visiting you ? ”
4:22:010:0	Balaam said to God , “ Balak son of Zippor , king of Moab , has sent me this message :
4:22:011:0	‘ Look , a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt , and they cover the face of the earth . Come and curse these people for me . Then perhaps I will be able to stand up to them and drive them from the land . ' ”
4:22:012:0	But God told Balaam , “ Do not go with them . You are not to curse these people , for they have been blessed ! ”
4:22:013:0	The next morning Balaam got up and told Balak 's officials , “ Go on home ! The Lord will not let me go with you . ”
4:22:014:0	So the Moabite officials returned to King Balak and reported , “ Balaam refused to come with us . ”
4:22:015:0	Then Balak tried again . This time he sent a larger number of even more distinguished officials than those he had sent the first time .
4:22:016:0	They went to Balaam and delivered this message to him : “ This is what Balak son of Zippor says : Please do n't let anything stop you from coming to help me .
4:22:017:0	I will pay you very well and do whatever you tell me . Just come and curse these people for me ! ”
4:22:018:0	But Balaam responded to Balak 's messengers , “ Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold , I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the Lord my God .
4:22:019:0	But stay here one more night , and I will see if the Lord has anything else to say to me . ”
4:22:002:1	Balaam and His Donkey
4:22:020:0	That night God came to Balaam and told him , “ Since these men have come for you , get up and go with them . But do only what I tell you to do . ”
4:22:021:0	So the next morning Balaam got up , saddled his donkey , and started off with the Moabite officials .
4:22:022:0	But God was angry that Balaam was going , so he sent the angel of the Lord to stand in the road to block his way . As Balaam and two servants were riding along ,
4:22:023:0	Balaam 's donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand . The donkey bolted off the road into a field , but Balaam beat it and turned it back onto the road .
4:22:024:0	Then the angel of the Lord stood at a place where the road narrowed between two vineyard walls .
4:22:025:0	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , it tried to squeeze by and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall . So Balaam beat the donkey again .
4:22:026:0	Then the angel of the Lord moved farther down the road and stood in a place too narrow for the donkey to get by at all .
4:22:027:0	This time when the donkey saw the angel , it lay down under Balaam . In a fit of rage Balaam beat the animal again with his staff .
4:22:028:0	Then the Lord gave the donkey the ability to speak . “ What have I done to you that deserves your beating me three times ? ” it asked Balaam .
4:22:029:0	“ You have made me look like a fool ! ” Balaam shouted . “ If I had a sword with me , I would kill you ! ”
4:22:030:0	“ But I am the same donkey you have ridden all your life , ” the donkey answered . “ Have I ever done anything like this before ? ” “ No , ” Balaam admitted .
4:22:031:0	Then the Lord opened Balaam 's eyes , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the roadway with a drawn sword in his hand . Balaam bowed his head and fell face down on the ground before him .
4:22:032:0	“ Why did you beat your donkey those three times ? ” the angel of the Lord demanded . “ Look , I have come to block your way because you are stubbornly resisting me .
4:22:033:0	Three times the donkey saw me and shied away ; otherwise , I would certainly have killed you by now and spared the donkey . ”
4:22:034:0	Then Balaam confessed to the angel of the Lord , “ I have sinned . I did n't realize you were standing in the road to block my way . I will return home if you are against my going . ”
4:22:035:0	But the angel of the Lord told Balaam , “ Go with these men , but say only what I tell you to say. ” So Balaam went on with Balak 's officials .
4:22:036:0	When King Balak heard that Balaam was on the way , he went out to meet him at a Moabite town on the Arnon River at the farthest border of his land .
4:22:037:0	“ Did n't I send you an urgent invitation ? Why did n't you come right away ? ” Balak asked Balaam . “ Did n't you believe me when I said I would reward you richly ? ”
4:22:038:0	Balaam replied , “ Look , now I have come , but I have no power to say whatever I want . I will speak only the message that God puts in my mouth . ”
4:22:039:0	Then Balaam accompanied Balak to Kiriath-huzoth ,
4:22:040:0	where the king sacrificed cattle and sheep . He sent portions of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him .
4:22:041:0	The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-baal . From there he could see some of the people of Israel spread out below him .
