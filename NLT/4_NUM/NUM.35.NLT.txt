4:35:001:1	Towns for the Levites
4:35:001:0	While Israel was camped beside the Jordan on the plains of Moab across from Jericho , the Lord said to Moses ,
4:35:002:0	“ Command the people of Israel to give to the Levites from their property certain towns to live in , along with the surrounding pasturelands .
4:35:003:0	These towns will be for the Levites to live in , and the surrounding lands will provide pasture for their cattle , flocks , and other livestock .
4:35:004:0	The pastureland assigned to the Levites around these towns will extend 1,500 feet from the town walls in every direction .
4:35:005:0	Measure off 3,000 feet outside the town walls in every direction — east , south , west , north — with the town at the center . This area will serve as the larger pastureland for the towns .
4:35:006:0	“ Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge , where a person who has accidentally killed someone can flee for safety . In addition , give them forty-two other towns .
4:35:007:0	In all , forty-eight towns with the surrounding pastureland will be given to the Levites .
4:35:002:1	Cities of Refuge
4:35:008:0	These towns will come from the property of the people of Israel . The larger tribes will give more towns to the Levites , while the smaller tribes will give fewer . Each tribe will give property in proportion to the size of its land . ”
4:35:009:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
4:35:010:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. “ When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
4:35:011:0	designate cities of refuge to which people can flee if they have killed someone accidentally .
4:35:012:0	These cities will be places of protection from a dead person 's relatives who want to avenge the death . The slayer must not be put to death before being tried by the community .
4:35:013:0	Designate six cities of refuge for yourselves ,
4:35:014:0	three on the east side of the Jordan River and three on the west in the land of Canaan .
4:35:015:0	These cities are for the protection of Israelites , foreigners living among you , and traveling merchants . Anyone who accidentally kills someone may flee there for safety .
4:35:016:0	“ But if someone strikes and kills another person with a piece of iron , it is murder , and the murderer must be executed .
4:35:017:0	Or if someone with a stone in his hand strikes and kills another person , it is murder , and the murderer must be put to death .
4:35:018:0	Or if someone strikes and kills another person with a wooden object , it is murder , and the murderer must be put to death .
4:35:019:0	The victim 's nearest relative is responsible for putting the murderer to death . When they meet , the avenger must put the murderer to death .
4:35:020:0	So if someone hates another person and waits in ambush , then pushes him or throws something at him and he dies , it is murder .
4:35:021:0	Or if someone hates another person and hits him with a fist and he dies , it is murder . In such cases , the avenger must put the murderer to death when they meet .
4:35:022:0	“ But suppose someone pushes another person without having shown previous hostility , or throws something that unintentionally hits another person ,
4:35:023:0	or accidentally drops a huge stone on someone , though they were not enemies , and the person dies .
4:35:024:0	If this should happen , the community must follow these regulations in making a judgment between the slayer and the avenger , the victim 's nearest relative :
4:35:025:0	The community must protect the slayer from the avenger and must escort the slayer back to live in the city of refuge to which he fled . There he must remain until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with the sacred oil .
4:35:026:0	“ But if the slayer ever leaves the limits of the city of refuge ,
4:35:027:0	and the avenger finds him outside the city and kills him , it will not be considered murder .
4:35:028:0	The slayer should have stayed inside the city of refuge until the death of the high priest . But after the death of the high priest , the slayer may return to his own property .
4:35:029:0	These are legal requirements for you to observe from generation to generation , wherever you may live .
4:35:030:0	“ All murderers must be put to death , but only if evidence is presented by more than one witness . No one may be put to death on the testimony of only one witness .
4:35:031:0	Also , you must never accept a ransom payment for the life of someone judged guilty of murder and subject to execution ; murderers must always be put to death .
4:35:032:0	And never accept a ransom payment from someone who has fled to a city of refuge , allowing a slayer to return to his property before the death of the high priest .
4:35:033:0	This will ensure that the land where you live will not be polluted , for murder pollutes the land . And no sacrifice except the execution of the murderer can purify the land from murder .
4:35:034:0	You must not defile the land where you live , for I live there myself . I am the Lord , who lives among the people of Israel . ”
