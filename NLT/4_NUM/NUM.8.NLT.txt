4:8:001:1	Preparing the Lamps
4:8:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
4:8:002:0	“ Give Aaron the following instructions : When you set up the seven lamps in the lampstand , place them so their light shines forward in front of the lampstand . ”
4:8:003:0	So Aaron did this . He set up the seven lamps so they reflected their light forward , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
4:8:002:1	The Levites Dedicated
4:8:004:0	The entire lampstand , from its base to its decorative blossoms , was made of beaten gold . It was built according to the exact design the Lord had shown Moses .
4:8:005:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
4:8:006:0	“ Now set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel and make them ceremonially clean .
4:8:007:0	Do this by sprinkling them with the water of purification , and have them shave their entire body and wash their clothing . Then they will be ceremonially clean .
4:8:008:0	Have them bring a young bull and a grain offering of choice flour moistened with olive oil , along with a second young bull for a sin offering .
4:8:009:0	Then assemble the whole community of Israel , and present the Levites at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
4:8:010:0	When you present the Levites before the Lord , the people of Israel must lay their hands on them .
4:8:011:0	Raising his hands , Aaron must then present the Levites to the Lord as a special offering from the people of Israel , thus dedicating them to the Lord 's service .
4:8:012:0	“ Next the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls . Present one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord , to purify the Levites and make them right with the Lord .
4:8:013:0	Then have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons , and raise your hands and present them as a special offering to the Lord .
4:8:014:0	In this way , you will set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel , and the Levites will belong to me .
4:8:015:0	After this , they may go into the Tabernacle to do their work , because you have purified them and presented them as a special offering .
4:8:016:0	“ Of all the people of Israel , the Levites are reserved for me . I have claimed them for myself in place of all the firstborn sons of the Israelites ; I have taken the Levites as their substitutes .
4:8:017:0	For all the firstborn males among the people of Israel are mine , both of people and of animals . I set them apart for myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians .
4:8:018:0	Yes , I have claimed the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons of Israel .
4:8:019:0	And of all the Israelites , I have assigned the Levites to Aaron and his sons . They will serve in the Tabernacle on behalf of the Israelites and make sacrifices to purify the people so no plague will strike them when they approach the sanctuary . ”
4:8:020:0	So Moses , Aaron , and the whole community of Israel dedicated the Levites , carefully following all the Lord 's instructions to Moses .
4:8:021:0	The Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes , and Aaron lifted them up and presented them to the Lord as a special offering . He then offered a sacrifice to purify them and make them right with the Lord .
4:8:022:0	After that the Levites went into the Tabernacle to perform their duties , assisting Aaron and his sons . So they carried out all the commands that the Lord gave Moses concerning the Levites .
4:8:023:0	The Lord also instructed Moses ,
4:8:024:0	“ This is the rule the Levites must follow : They must begin serving in the Tabernacle at the age of twenty-five ,
4:8:025:0	and they must retire at the age of fifty .
4:8:026:0	After retirement they may assist their fellow Levites by serving as guards at the Tabernacle , but they may not officiate in the service . This is how you must assign duties to the Levites . ”
