49:6:001:1	Children and Parents
49:6:001:0	Children , obey your parents because you belong to the Lord , for this is the right thing to do .
49:6:002:0	“ Honor your father and mother. ” This is the first commandment with a promise :
49:6:003:0	If you honor your father and mother , “ things will go well for you , and you will have a long life on the earth . ”
49:6:002:1	Slaves and Masters
49:6:004:0	Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them . Rather , bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord .
49:6:005:0	Slaves , obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear . Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ .
49:6:006:0	Try to please them all the time , not just when they are watching you . As slaves of Christ , do the will of God with all your heart .
49:6:007:0	Work with enthusiasm , as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people .
49:6:008:0	Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do , whether we are slaves or free .
49:6:003:1	The Whole Armor of God
49:6:009:0	Masters , treat your slaves in the same way . Do n't threaten them ; remember , you both have the same Master in heaven , and he has no favorites .
49:6:010:0	A final word : Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power .
49:6:011:0	Put on all of God 's armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil .
49:6:012:0	For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies , but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world , against mighty powers in this dark world , and against evil spirits in the heavenly places .
49:6:013:0	Therefore , put on every piece of God 's armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil . Then after the battle you will still be standing firm .
49:6:014:0	Stand your ground , putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God 's righteousness .
49:6:015:0	For shoes , put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared .
49:6:016:0	In addition to all of these , hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil .
49:6:017:0	Put on salvation as your helmet , and take the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49:6:018:0	Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion . Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere .
49:6:019:0	And pray for me , too . Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God 's mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike .
49:6:004:1	Final Greetings
49:6:020:0	I am in chains now , still preaching this message as God 's ambassador . So pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him , as I should .
49:6:021:0	To bring you up to date , Tychicus will give you a full report about what I am doing and how I am getting along . He is a beloved brother and faithful helper in the Lord 's work .
49:6:022:0	I have sent him to you for this very purpose—to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you .
49:6:023:0	Peace be with you , dear brothers and sisters , and may God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you love with faithfulness .
49:6:024:0	May God 's grace be eternally upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ .
