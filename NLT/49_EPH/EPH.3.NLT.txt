49:3:001:1	God 's Mysterious Plan Revealed
49:3:001:0	When I think of all this , I , Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the benefit of you Gentiles . . .
49:3:002:0	assuming , by the way , that you know God gave me the special responsibility of extending his grace to you Gentiles .
49:3:003:0	As I briefly wrote earlier , God himself revealed his mysterious plan to me .
49:3:004:0	As you read what I have written , you will understand my insight into this plan regarding Christ .
49:3:005:0	God did not reveal it to previous generations , but now by his Spirit he has revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets .
49:3:006:0	And this is God 's plan : Both Gentiles and Jews who believe the Good News share equally in the riches inherited by God 's children . Both are part of the same body , and both enjoy the promise of blessings because they belong to Christ Jesus .
49:3:007:0	By God 's grace and mighty power , I have been given the privilege of serving him by spreading this Good News .
49:3:008:0	Though I am the least deserving of all God 's people , he graciously gave me the privilege of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available to them in Christ .
49:3:009:0	I was chosen to explain to everyone this mysterious plan that God , the Creator of all things , had kept secret from the beginning .
49:3:010:0	God 's purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety to all the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly places .
49:3:011:0	This was his eternal plan , which he carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord .
49:3:012:0	Because of Christ and our faith in him , we can now come boldly and confidently into God 's presence .
49:3:002:1	Paul 's Prayer for Spiritual Growth
49:3:013:0	So please do n't lose heart because of my trials here . I am suffering for you , so you should feel honored .
49:3:014:0	When I think of all this , I fall to my knees and pray to the Father ,
49:3:015:0	the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth .
49:3:016:0	I pray that from his glorious , unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit .
49:3:017:0	Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him . Your roots will grow down into God 's love and keep you strong .
49:3:018:0	And may you have the power to understand , as all God 's people should , how wide , how long , how high , and how deep his love is .
49:3:019:0	May you experience the love of Christ , though it is too great to understand fully . Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God .
49:3:020:0	Now all glory to God , who is able , through his mighty power at work within us , to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think .
49:3:021:0	Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever ! Amen .
