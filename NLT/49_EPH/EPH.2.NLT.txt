49:2:001:1	Made Alive with Christ
49:2:001:0	Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins .
49:2:002:0	You used to live in sin , just like the rest of the world , obeying the devil—the commander of the powers in the unseen world . He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God .
49:2:003:0	All of us used to live that way , following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature . By our very nature we were subject to God 's anger , just like everyone else .
49:2:004:0	But God is so rich in mercy , and he loved us so much ,
49:2:005:0	that even though we were dead because of our sins , he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead . ( It is only by God 's grace that you have been saved ! )
49:2:006:0	For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus .
49:2:007:0	So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us , as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus .
49:2:008:0	God saved you by his grace when you believed . And you ca n't take credit for this ; it is a gift from God .
49:2:009:0	Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done , so none of us can boast about it .
49:2:002:1	Oneness and Peace in Christ
49:2:010:0	For we are God 's masterpiece . He has created us anew in Christ Jesus , so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago .
49:2:011:0	Do n't forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders . You were called “ uncircumcised heathens ” by the Jews , who were proud of their circumcision , even though it affected only their bodies and not their hearts .
49:2:012:0	In those days you were living apart from Christ . You were excluded from citizenship among the people of Israel , and you did not know the covenant promises God had made to them . You lived in this world without God and without hope .
49:2:013:0	But now you have been united with Christ Jesus . Once you were far away from God , but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ .
49:2:014:0	For Christ himself has brought peace to us . He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when , in his own body on the cross , he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us .
49:2:015:0	He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations . He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups .
49:2:016:0	Together as one body , Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross , and our hostility toward each other was put to death .
49:2:017:0	He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him , and peace to the Jews who were near .
49:2:003:1	A Temple for the Lord
49:2:018:0	Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us .
49:2:019:0	So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners . You are citizens along with all of God 's holy people . You are members of God 's family .
49:2:020:0	Together , we are his house , built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets . And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself .
49:2:021:0	We are carefully joined together in him , becoming a holy temple for the Lord .
49:2:022:0	Through him you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit .
