49:5:001:1	Living in the Light
49:5:001:0	Imitate God , therefore , in everything you do , because you are his dear children .
49:5:002:0	Live a life filled with love , following the example of Christ . He loved us and offered himself as a sacrifice for us , a pleasing aroma to God .
49:5:003:0	Let there be no sexual immorality , impurity , or greed among you . Such sins have no place among God 's people .
49:5:004:0	Obscene stories , foolish talk , and coarse jokes—these are not for you . Instead , let there be thankfulness to God .
49:5:005:0	You can be sure that no immoral , impure , or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God . For a greedy person is an idolater , worshiping the things of this world .
49:5:006:0	Do n't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins , for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him .
49:5:007:0	Do n't participate in the things these people do .
49:5:008:0	For once you were full of darkness , but now you have light from the Lord . So live as people of light !
49:5:009:0	For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true .
49:5:010:0	Carefully determine what pleases the Lord .
49:5:011:0	Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness ; instead , expose them .
49:5:012:0	It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret .
49:5:013:0	But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them ,
49:5:002:1	Living by the Spirit 's Power
49:5:014:0	for the light makes everything visible . This is why it is said , “ Awake , O sleeper , rise up from the dead , and Christ will give you light . ”
49:5:015:0	So be careful how you live . Do n't live like fools , but like those who are wise .
49:5:016:0	Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days .
49:5:017:0	Do n't act thoughtlessly , but understand what the Lord wants you to do .
49:5:018:0	Do n't be drunk with wine , because that will ruin your life . Instead , be filled with the Holy Spirit ,
49:5:019:0	singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves , and making music to the Lord in your hearts .
49:5:003:1	Spirit-Guided Relationships : Wives and Husbands
49:5:020:0	And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49:5:021:0	And further , submit to one another out of reverence for Christ .
49:5:022:0	For wives , this means submit to your husbands as to the Lord .
49:5:023:0	For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church . He is the Savior of his body , the church .
49:5:024:0	As the church submits to Christ , so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything .
49:5:025:0	For husbands , this means love your wives , just as Christ loved the church . He gave up his life for her
49:5:026:0	to make her holy and clean , washed by the cleansing of God 's word .
49:5:027:0	He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish . Instead , she will be holy and without fault .
49:5:028:0	In the same way , husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies . For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself .
49:5:029:0	No one hates his own body but feeds and cares for it , just as Christ cares for the church .
49:5:030:0	And we are members of his body .
49:5:031:0	As the Scriptures say , “ A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife , and the two are united into one . ”
49:5:032:0	This is a great mystery , but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one .
49:5:033:0	So again I say , each man must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband .
