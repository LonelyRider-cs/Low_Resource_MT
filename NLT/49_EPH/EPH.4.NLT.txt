49:4:001:1	Unity in the Body
49:4:001:0	Therefore I , a prisoner for serving the Lord , beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling , for you have been called by God .
49:4:002:0	Always be humble and gentle . Be patient with each other , making allowance for each other 's faults because of your love .
49:4:003:0	Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit , binding yourselves together with peace .
49:4:004:0	For there is one body and one Spirit , just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future .
49:4:005:0	There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49:4:006:0	one God and Father of all , who is over all , in all , and living through all .
49:4:007:0	However , he has given each one of us a special gift through the generosity of Christ .
49:4:008:0	That is why the Scriptures say , “ When he ascended to the heights , he led a crowd of captivesand gave gifts to his people . ”
49:4:009:0	Notice that it says “ he ascended. ” This clearly means that Christ also descended to our lowly world .
49:4:010:0	And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than all the heavens , so that he might fill the entire universe with himself .
49:4:011:0	Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church : the apostles , the prophets , the evangelists , and the pastors and teachers .
49:4:012:0	Their responsibility is to equip God 's people to do his work and build up the church , the body of Christ .
49:4:013:0	This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God 's Son that we will be mature in the Lord , measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ .
49:4:014:0	Then we will no longer be immature like children . We wo n't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching . We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth .
49:4:015:0	Instead , we will speak the truth in love , growing in every way more and more like Christ , who is the head of his body , the church .
49:4:002:1	Living as Children of Light
49:4:016:0	He makes the whole body fit together perfectly . As each part does its own special work , it helps the other parts grow , so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love .
49:4:017:0	With the Lord 's authority I say this : Live no longer as the Gentiles do , for they are hopelessly confused .
49:4:018:0	Their minds are full of darkness ; they wander far from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him .
49:4:019:0	They have no sense of shame . They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity .
49:4:020:0	But that is n't what you learned about Christ .
49:4:021:0	Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him ,
49:4:022:0	throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life , which is corrupted by lust and deception .
49:4:023:0	Instead , let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes .
49:4:024:0	Put on your new nature , created to be like God — truly righteous and holy .
49:4:025:0	So stop telling lies . Let us tell our neighbors the truth , for we are all parts of the same body .
49:4:026:0	And “ do n't sin by letting anger control you. ” Do n't let the sun go down while you are still angry ,
49:4:027:0	for anger gives a foothold to the devil .
49:4:028:0	If you are a thief , quit stealing . Instead , use your hands for good hard work , and then give generously to others in need .
49:4:029:0	Do n't use foul or abusive language . Let everything you say be good and helpful , so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them .
49:4:030:0	And do not bring sorrow to God 's Holy Spirit by the way you live . Remember , he has identified you as his own , guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption .
49:4:031:0	Get rid of all bitterness , rage , anger , harsh words , and slander , as well as all types of evil behavior .
49:4:032:0	Instead , be kind to each other , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , just as God through Christ has forgiven you .
