28:5:001:1	The Failure of Israel 's Leaders
28:5:001:0	“ Hear this , you priests.Pay attention , you leaders of Israel.Listen , you members of the royal family.Judgment has been handed down against you.For you have led the people into a snareby worshiping the idols at Mizpah and Tabor .
28:5:002:0	You have dug a deep pit to trap them at Acacia Grove.But I will settle with you for what you have done .
28:5:003:0	I know what you are like , O Ephraim.You can not hide yourself from me , O Israel.You have left me as a prostitute leaves her husband ; you are utterly defiled .
28:5:004:0	Your deeds wo n't let you return to your God.You are a prostitute through and through , and you do not know the Lord .
28:5:005:0	“ The arrogance of Israel testifies against her ; Israel and Ephraim will stumble under their load of guilt.Judah , too , will fall with them .
28:5:006:0	When they come with their flocks and herdsto offer sacrifices to the Lord , they will not find him , because he has withdrawn from them .
28:5:007:0	They have betrayed the honor of the Lord , bearing children that are not his.Now their false religion will devour themalong with their wealth .
28:5:008:0	“ Sound the alarm in Gibeah ! Blow the trumpet in Ramah ! Raise the battle cry in Beth-aven ! Lead on into battle , O warriors of Benjamin !
28:5:009:0	One thing is certain , Israel : On your day of punishment , you will become a heap of rubble .
28:5:010:0	“ The leaders of Judah have become like thieves.So I will pour my anger on them like a waterfall .
28:5:011:0	The people of Israel will be crushed and broken by my judgmentbecause they are determined to worship idols .
28:5:012:0	I will destroy Israel as a moth consumes wool.I will make Judah as weak as rotten wood .
28:5:013:0	“ When Israel and Judah saw how sick they were , Israel turned to Assyria—to the great king there—but he could neither help nor cure them .
28:5:014:0	I will be like a lion to Israel , like a strong young lion to Judah.I will tear them to pieces ! I will carry them off , and no one will be left to rescue them .
28:5:015:0	Then I will return to my placeuntil they admit their guilt and turn to me.For as soon as trouble comes , they will earnestly search for me . ”
