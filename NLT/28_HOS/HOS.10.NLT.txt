28:10:001:1	The
28:10:002:1	Lord
28:10:003:1	's Judgment against Israel
28:10:001:0	How prosperous Israel is—a luxuriant vine loaded with fruit.But the richer the people get , the more pagan altars they build.The more bountiful their harvests , the more beautiful their sacred pillars .
28:10:002:0	The hearts of the people are fickle ; they are guilty and must be punished.The Lord will break down their altarsand smash their sacred pillars .
28:10:003:0	Then they will say , “ We have no kingbecause we did n't fear the Lord.But even if we had a king , what could he do for us anyway ? ”
28:10:004:0	They spout empty wordsand make covenants they do n't intend to keep.So injustice springs up among themlike poisonous weeds in a farmer 's field .
28:10:005:0	The people of Samaria tremble in fearfor their calf idol at Beth-aven , and they mourn for it.Though its priests rejoice over it , its glory will be stripped away .
28:10:006:0	This idol will be carted away to Assyria , a gift to the great king there.Ephraim will be ridiculed and Israel will be shamed , because its people have trusted in this idol .
28:10:007:0	Samaria and its king will be cut off ; they will float away like driftwood on an ocean wave .
28:10:008:0	And the pagan shrines of Aven , the place of Israel 's sin , will crumble.Thorns and thistles will grow up around their altars.They will beg the mountains , “ Bury us ! ” and plead with the hills , “ Fall on us ! ”
28:10:009:0	The Lord says , “ O Israel , ever since Gibeah , there has been only sin and more sin ! You have made no progress whatsoever.Was it not right that the wicked men of Gibeah were attacked ?
28:10:010:0	Now whenever it fits my plan , I will attack you , too.I will call out the armies of the nationsto punish you for your multiplied sins .
28:10:011:0	“ Israel is like a trained heifer treading out the grain—an easy job she loves.But I will put a heavy yoke on her tender neck.I will force Judah to pull the plowand Israel to break up the hard ground .
28:10:012:0	I said , ‘ Plant the good seeds of righteousness , and you will harvest a crop of love.Plow up the hard ground of your hearts , for now is the time to seek the Lord , that he may comeand shower righteousness upon you . '
28:10:013:0	“ But you have cultivated wickednessand harvested a thriving crop of sins.You have eaten the fruit of lies—trusting in your military might , believing that great armiescould make your nation safe .
28:10:014:0	Now the terrors of warwill rise among your people.All your fortifications will fall , just as when Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel.Even mothers and childrenwere dashed to death there .
28:10:015:0	You will share that fate , Bethel , because of your great wickedness.When the day of judgment dawns , the king of Israel will be completely destroyed .
