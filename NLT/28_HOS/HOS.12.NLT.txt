28:12:001:0	The people of Israel feed on the wind ; they chase after the east wind all day long.They pile up lies and violence ; they are making an alliance with Assyriawhile sending olive oil to buy support from Egypt .
28:12:002:0	Now the Lord is bringing charges against Judah.He is about to punish Jacob for all his deceitful ways , and pay him back for all he has done .
28:12:003:0	Even in the womb , Jacob struggled with his brother ; when he became a man , he even fought with God .
28:12:004:0	Yes , he wrestled with the angel and won.He wept and pleaded for a blessing from him.There at Bethel he met God face to face , and God spoke to him—
28:12:005:0	the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , the Lord is his name !
28:12:006:0	So now , come back to your God.Act with love and justice , and always depend on him .
28:12:007:0	But no , the people are like crafty merchantsselling from dishonest scales—they love to cheat .
28:12:008:0	Israel boasts , “ I am rich ! I 've made a fortune all by myself ! No one has caught me cheating ! My record is spotless ! ”
28:12:009:0	“ But I am the Lord your God , who rescued you from slavery in Egypt.And I will make you live in tents again , as you do each year at the Festival of Shelters .
28:12:010:0	I sent my prophets to warn youwith many visions and parables . ”
28:12:011:0	But the people of Gilead are worthlessbecause of their idol worship.And in Gilgal , too , they sacrifice bulls ; their altars are lined up like the heaps of stonealong the edges of a plowed field .
28:12:012:0	Jacob fled to the land of Aram , and there he earned a wife by tending sheep .
28:12:013:0	Then by a prophetthe Lord brought Jacob 's descendants out of Egypt ; and by that prophetthey were protected .
28:12:014:0	But the people of Israelhave bitterly provoked the Lord , so their Lord will now sentence them to deathin payment for their sins .
