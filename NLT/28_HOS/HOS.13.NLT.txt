28:13:001:1	The
28:13:002:1	Lord
28:13:003:1	's Anger against Israel
28:13:001:0	When the tribe of Ephraim spoke , the people shook with fear , for that tribe was important in Israel.But the people of Ephraim sinned by worshiping Baaland thus sealed their destruction .
28:13:002:0	Now they continue to sin by making silver idols , images shaped skillfully with human hands. “ Sacrifice to these , ” they cry , “ and kiss the calf idols ! ”
28:13:003:0	Therefore , they will disappear like the morning mist , like dew in the morning sun , like chaff blown by the wind , like smoke from a chimney .
28:13:004:0	“ I have been the Lord your Godever since I brought you out of Egypt.You must acknowledge no God but me , for there is no other savior .
28:13:005:0	I took care of you in the wilderness , in that dry and thirsty land .
28:13:006:0	But when you had eaten and were satisfied , you became proud and forgot me .
28:13:007:0	So now I will attack you like a lion , like a leopard that lurks along the road .
28:13:008:0	Like a bear whose cubs have been taken away , I will tear out your heart.I will devour you like a hungry lionessand mangle you like a wild animal .
28:13:009:0	“ You are about to be destroyed , O Israel — yes , by me , your only helper .
28:13:010:0	Now where is your king ? Let him save you ! Where are all the leaders of the land , the king and the officials you demanded of me ?
28:13:011:0	In my anger I gave you kings , and in my fury I took them away .
28:13:012:0	“ Ephraim 's guilt has been collected , and his sin has been stored up for punishment .
28:13:013:0	Pain has come to the peoplelike the pain of childbirth , but they are like a childwho resists being born.The moment of birth has arrived , but they stay in the womb !
28:13:014:0	“ Should I ransom them from the grave ? Should I redeem them from death ? O death , bring on your terrors ! O grave , bring on your plagues ! For I will not take pity on them .
28:13:015:0	Ephraim was the most fruitful of all his brothers , but the east wind — a blast from the Lord — will arise in the desert.All their flowing springs will run dry , and all their wells will disappear.Every precious thing they ownwill be plundered and carried away .
28:13:016:0	The people of Samariamust bear the consequences of their guiltbecause they rebelled against their God.They will be killed by an invading army , their little ones dashed to death against the ground , their pregnant women ripped open by swords . ”
