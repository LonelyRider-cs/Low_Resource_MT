28:1:001:1	Hosea 's Wife and Children
28:1:001:0	The Lord gave this message to Hosea son of Beeri during the years when Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah were kings of Judah , and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel .
28:1:002:0	When the Lord first began speaking to Israel through Hosea , he said to him , “ Go and marry a prostitute , so that some of her children will be conceived in prostitution . This will illustrate how Israel has acted like a prostitute by turning against the Lord and worshiping other gods . ”
28:1:003:0	So Hosea married Gomer , the daughter of Diblaim , and she became pregnant and gave Hosea a son .
28:1:004:0	And the Lord said , “ Name the child Jezreel , for I am about to punish King Jehu 's dynasty to avenge the murders he committed at Jezreel . In fact , I will bring an end to Israel 's independence .
28:1:005:0	I will break its military power in the Jezreel Valley . ”
28:1:006:0	Soon Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter . And the Lord said to Hosea , “ Name your daughter Lo-ruhamah — ‘ Not loved ' — for I will no longer show love to the people of Israel or forgive them .
28:1:007:0	But I will show love to the people of Judah . I will free them from their enemies — not with weapons and armies or horses and charioteers , but by my power as the Lord their God . ”
28:1:008:0	After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah , she again became pregnant and gave birth to a second son .
28:1:009:0	And the Lord said , “ Name him Lo-ammi — ‘ Not my people ' — for Israel is not my people , and I am not their God .
28:1:010:0	“ Yet the time will come when Israel 's people will be like the sands of the seashore — too many to count ! Then , at the place where they were told , ‘ You are not my people , ' it will be said , ‘ You are children of the living God . '
28:1:011:0	Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite together . They will choose one leader for themselves , and they will return from exile together . What a day that will be — the day of Jezreel — when God will again plant his people in his land .
28:1:012:0	“ In that day you will call your brothers Ammi — ‘ My people . ' And you will call your sisters Ruhamah — ‘ The ones I love . '
