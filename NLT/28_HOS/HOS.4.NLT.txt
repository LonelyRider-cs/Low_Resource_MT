28:4:001:1	The
28:4:002:1	Lord
28:4:003:1	's Case against Israel
28:4:001:0	Hear the word of the Lord , O people of Israel ! The Lord has brought charges against you , saying : “ There is no faithfulness , no kindness , no knowledge of God in your land .
28:4:002:0	You make vows and break them ; you kill and steal and commit adultery.There is violence everywhere — one murder after another .
28:4:003:0	That is why your land is in mourning , and everyone is wasting away.Even the wild animals , the birds of the sky , and the fish of the sea are disappearing .
28:4:004:0	“ Do n't point your finger at someone elseand try to pass the blame ! My complaint , you priests , is with you .
28:4:005:0	So you will stumble in broad daylight , and your false prophets will fall with you in the night.And I will destroy Israel , your mother .
28:4:006:0	My people are being destroyedbecause they do n't know me.Since you priests refuse to know me , I refuse to recognize you as my priests.Since you have forgotten the laws of your God , I will forget to bless your children .
28:4:007:0	The more priests there are , the more they sin against me.They have exchanged the glory of Godfor the shame of idols .
28:4:008:0	“ When the people bring their sin offerings , the priests get fed.So the priests are glad when the people sin !
28:4:009:0	‘ And what the priests do , the people also do . 'So now I will punish both priests and peoplefor their wicked deeds .
28:4:010:0	They will eat and still be hungry.They will play the prostitute and gain nothing from it , for they have deserted the Lord
28:4:011:0	to worship other gods. “ Wine has robbed my peopleof their understanding .
28:4:012:0	They ask a piece of wood for advice ! They think a stick can tell them the future ! Longing after idolshas made them foolish.They have played the prostitute , serving other gods and deserting their God .
28:4:013:0	They offer sacrifices to idols on the mountaintops.They go up into the hills to burn incensein the pleasant shade of oaks , poplars , and terebinth trees. “ That is why your daughters turn to prostitution , and your daughters-in-law commit adultery .
28:4:014:0	But why should I punish themfor their prostitution and adultery ? For your men are doing the same thing , sinning with whores and shrine prostitutes.O foolish people ! You refuse to understand , so you will be destroyed .
28:4:015:0	“ Though you , Israel , are a prostitute , may Judah not be guilty of such things.Do not join the false worship at Gilgal or Beth-aven , and do not take oaths there in the Lord 's name .
28:4:016:0	Israel is stubborn , like a stubborn heifer.So should the Lord feed herlike a lamb in a lush pasture ?
28:4:017:0	Leave Israel alone , because she is married to idolatry .
28:4:018:0	When the rulers of Israel finish their drinking , off they go to find some prostitutes.They love shame more than honor .
28:4:019:0	So a mighty wind will sweep them away.Their sacrifices to idols will bring them shame .
