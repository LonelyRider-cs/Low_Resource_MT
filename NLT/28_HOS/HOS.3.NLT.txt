28:3:001:1	Hosea 's Wife Is Redeemed
28:3:001:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Go and love your wife again , even though she commits adultery with another lover . This will illustrate that the Lord still loves Israel , even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them . ”
28:3:002:0	So I bought her back for fifteen pieces of silver and five bushels of barley and a measure of wine .
28:3:003:0	Then I said to her , “ You must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution . During this time , you will not have sexual relations with anyone , not even with me . ”
28:3:004:0	This shows that Israel will go a long time without a king or prince , and without sacrifices , sacred pillars , priests , or even idols !
28:3:005:0	But afterward the people will return and devote themselves to the Lord their God and to David 's descendant , their king . In the last days , they will tremble in awe of the Lord and of his goodness .
