28:11:001:1	The
28:11:002:1	Lord
28:11:003:1	's Love for Israel
28:11:001:0	“ When Israel was a child , I loved him , and I called my son out of Egypt .
28:11:002:0	But the more I called to him , the farther he moved from me , offering sacrifices to the images of Baaland burning incense to idols .
28:11:003:0	I myself taught Israel how to walk , leading him along by the hand.But he does n't know or even carethat it was I who took care of him .
28:11:004:0	I led Israel alongwith my ropes of kindness and love.I lifted the yoke from his neck , and I myself stooped to feed him .
28:11:005:0	“ But since my people refuse to return to me , they will return to Egyptand will be forced to serve Assyria .
28:11:006:0	War will swirl through their cities ; their enemies will crash through their gates.They will destroy them , trapping them in their own evil plans .
28:11:007:0	For my people are determined to desert me.They call me the Most High , but they do n't truly honor me .
28:11:008:0	“ Oh , how can I give you up , Israel ? How can I let you go ? How can I destroy you like Admahor demolish you like Zeboiim ? My heart is torn within me , and my compassion overflows .
28:11:009:0	No , I will not unleash my fierce anger.I will not completely destroy Israel , for I am God and not a mere mortal.I am the Holy One living among you , and I will not come to destroy .
28:11:010:0	For someday the people will follow me.I , the Lord , will roar like a lion.And when I roar , my people will return trembling from the west .
28:11:004:1	Charges against Israel and Judah
28:11:011:0	Like a flock of birds , they will come from Egypt.Trembling like doves , they will return from Assyria.And I will bring them home again , ” says the Lord .
28:11:012:0	Israel surrounds me with lies and deceit , but Judah still obeys Godand is faithful to the Holy One .
