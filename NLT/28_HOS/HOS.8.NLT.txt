28:8:001:1	Israel Harvests the Whirlwind
28:8:001:0	“ Sound the alarm ! The enemy descends like an eagle on the people of the Lord , for they have broken my covenantand revolted against my law .
28:8:002:0	Now Israel pleads with me , ‘ Help us , for you are our God ! '
28:8:003:0	But it is too late.The people of Israel have rejected what is good , and now their enemies will chase after them .
28:8:004:0	The people have appointed kings without my consent , and princes without my approval.By making idols for themselves from their silver and gold , they have brought about their own destruction .
28:8:005:0	“ O Samaria , I reject this calf—this idol you have made.My fury burns against you.How long will you be incapable of innocence ?
28:8:006:0	This calf you worship , O Israel , was crafted by your own hands ! It is not God ! Therefore , it must be smashed to bits .
28:8:007:0	“ They have planted the windand will harvest the whirlwind.The stalks of grain witherand produce nothing to eat.And even if there is any grain , foreigners will eat it .
28:8:008:0	The people of Israel have been swallowed up ; they lie among the nations like an old discarded pot .
28:8:009:0	Like a wild donkey looking for a mate , they have gone up to Assyria.The people of Israel have sold themselves—sold themselves to many lovers .
28:8:010:0	But though they have sold themselves to many allies , I will now gather them together for judgment.Then they will writheunder the burden of the great king .
28:8:011:0	“ Israel has built many altars to take away sin , but these very altars became places for sinning !
28:8:012:0	Even though I gave them all my laws , they act as if those laws do n't apply to them .
28:8:013:0	The people love to offer sacrifices to me , feasting on the meat , but I do not accept their sacrifices.I will hold my people accountable for their sins , and I will punish them.They will return to Egypt .
28:8:014:0	Israel has forgotten its Maker and built great palaces , and Judah has fortified its cities.Therefore , I will send down fire on their citiesand will burn up their fortresses . ”
