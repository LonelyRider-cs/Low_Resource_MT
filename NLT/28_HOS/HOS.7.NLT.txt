28:7:001:1	Israel 's Love for Wickedness
28:7:001:0	“ I want to heal Israel , but its sins are too great.Samaria is filled with liars.Thieves are on the insideand bandits on the outside !
28:7:002:0	Its people do n't realizethat I am watching them.Their sinful deeds are all around them , and I see them all .
28:7:003:0	“ The people entertain the king with their wickedness , and the princes laugh at their lies .
28:7:004:0	They are all adulterers , always aflame with lust.They are like an oven that is kept hotwhile the baker is kneading the dough .
28:7:005:0	On royal holidays , the princes get drunk with wine , carousing with those who mock them .
28:7:006:0	Their hearts are like an ovenblazing with intrigue.Their plot smolders through the night , and in the morning it breaks out like a raging fire .
28:7:007:0	Burning like an oven , they consume their leaders.They kill their kings one after another , and no one cries to me for help .
28:7:008:0	“ The people of Israel mingle with godless foreigners , making themselves as worthless as a half-baked cake !
28:7:009:0	Worshiping foreign gods has sapped their strength , but they do n't even know it.Their hair is gray , but they do n't realize they 're old and weak .
28:7:010:0	Their arrogance testifies against them , yet they do n't return to the Lord their Godor even try to find him .
28:7:011:0	“ The people of Israel have become like silly , witless doves , first calling to Egypt , then flying to Assyria for help .
28:7:012:0	But as they fly about , I will throw my net over themand bring them down like a bird from the sky.I will punish them for all the evil they do .
28:7:013:0	“ What sorrow awaits those who have deserted me ! Let them die , for they have rebelled against me.I wanted to redeem them , but they have told lies about me .
28:7:014:0	They do not cry out to me with sincere hearts.Instead , they sit on their couches and wail.They cut themselves , begging foreign gods for grain and new wine , and they turn away from me .
28:7:015:0	I trained them and made them strong , yet now they plot evil against me .
28:7:016:0	They look everywhere except to the Most High.They are as useless as a crooked bow.Their leaders will be killed by their enemiesbecause of their insolence toward me.Then the people of Egyptwill laugh at them .
