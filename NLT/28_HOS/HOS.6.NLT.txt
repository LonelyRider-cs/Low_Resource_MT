28:6:001:1	A Call to Repentance
28:6:001:0	“ Come , let us return to the Lord.He has torn us to pieces ; now he will heal us.He has injured us ; now he will bandage our wounds .
28:6:002:0	In just a short time he will restore us , so that we may live in his presence .
28:6:003:0	Oh , that we might know the Lord ! Let us press on to know him.He will respond to us as surely as the arrival of dawnor the coming of rains in early spring . ”
28:6:004:0	“ O Israel and Judah , what should I do with you ? ” asks the Lord. “ For your love vanishes like the morning mistand disappears like dew in the sunlight .
28:6:005:0	I sent my prophets to cut you to pieces — to slaughter you with my words , with judgments as inescapable as light .
28:6:006:0	I want you to show love , not offer sacrifices.I want you to know memore than I want burnt offerings .
28:6:007:0	But like Adam , you broke my covenantand betrayed my trust .
28:6:008:0	“ Gilead is a city of sinners , tracked with footprints of blood .
28:6:009:0	Priests form bands of robbers , waiting in ambush for their victims.They murder travelers along the road to Shechemand practice every kind of sin .
28:6:010:0	Yes , I have seen something horrible in Ephraim and Israel : My people are defiled by prostituting themselves with other gods !
28:6:011:0	“ O Judah , a harvest of punishment is also waiting for you , though I wanted to restore the fortunes of my people .
