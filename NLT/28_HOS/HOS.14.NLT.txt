28:14:001:1	Healing for the Repentant
28:14:001:0	Return , O Israel , to the Lord your God , for your sins have brought you down .
28:14:002:0	Bring your confessions , and return to the Lord.Say to him , “ Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us , so that we may offer you our praises .
28:14:003:0	Assyria can not save us , nor can our warhorses.Never again will we say to the idols we have made , ‘ You are our gods . 'No , in you alonedo the orphans find mercy . ”
28:14:004:0	The Lord says , “ Then I will heal you of your faithlessness ; my love will know no bounds , for my anger will be gone forever .
28:14:005:0	I will be to Israellike a refreshing dew from heaven.Israel will blossom like the lily ; it will send roots deep into the soillike the cedars in Lebanon .
28:14:006:0	Its branches will spread out like beautiful olive trees , as fragrant as the cedars of Lebanon .
28:14:007:0	My people will again live under my shade.They will flourish like grain and blossom like grapevines.They will be as fragrant as the wines of Lebanon .
28:14:008:0	“ O Israel , stay away from idols ! I am the one who answers your prayers and cares for you.I am like a tree that is always green ; all your fruit comes from me . ”
28:14:009:0	Let those who are wise understand these things.Let those with discernment listen carefully.The paths of the Lord are true and right , and righteous people live by walking in them.But in those paths sinners stumble and fall .
