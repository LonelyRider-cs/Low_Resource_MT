28:9:001:1	Hosea Announces Israel 's Punishment
28:9:001:0	O people of Israel , do not rejoice as other nations do.For you have been unfaithful to your God , hiring yourselves out like prostitutes , worshiping other gods on every threshing floor .
28:9:002:0	So now your harvests will be too small to feed you.There will be no grapes for making new wine .
28:9:003:0	You may no longer stay here in the Lord 's land.Instead , you will return to Egypt , and in Assyria you will eat foodthat is ceremonially unclean .
28:9:004:0	There you will make no offerings of wine to the Lord.None of your sacrifices there will please him.They will be unclean , like food touched by a person in mourning.All who present such sacrifices will be defiled.They may eat this food themselves , but they may not offer it to the Lord .
28:9:005:0	What then will you do on festival days ? How will you observe the Lord 's festivals ?
28:9:006:0	Even if you escape destruction from Assyria , Egypt will conquer you , and Memphis will bury you.Nettles will take over your treasures of silver ; thistles will invade your ruined homes .
28:9:007:0	The time of Israel 's punishment has come ; the day of payment is here.Soon Israel will know this all too well.Because of your great sin and hostility , you say , “ The prophets are crazyand the inspired men are fools ! ”
28:9:008:0	The prophet is a watchman over Israel for my God , yet traps are laid for him wherever he goes.He faces hostility even in the house of God .
28:9:009:0	The things my people do are as depravedas what they did in Gibeah long ago.God will not forget.He will surely punish them for their sins .
28:9:010:0	The Lord says , “ O Israel , when I first found you , it was like finding fresh grapes in the desert.When I saw your ancestors , it was like seeing the first ripe figs of the season.But then they deserted me for Baal-peor , giving themselves to that shameful idol.Soon they became vile , as vile as the god they worshiped .
28:9:011:0	The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird , for your children will not be bornor grow in the wombor even be conceived .
28:9:012:0	Even if you do have children who grow up , I will take them from you.It will be a terrible day when I turn awayand leave you alone .
28:9:013:0	I have watched Israel become as beautiful as Tyre.But now Israel will bring out her children for slaughter . ”
28:9:014:0	O Lord , what should I request for your people ? I will ask for wombs that do n't give birthand breasts that give no milk .
28:9:015:0	The Lord says , “ All their wickedness began at Gilgal ; there I began to hate them.I will drive them from my landbecause of their evil actions.I will love them no morebecause all their leaders are rebels .
28:9:016:0	The people of Israel are struck down.Their roots are dried up , and they will bear no more fruit.And if they give birth , I will slaughter their beloved children . ”
28:9:017:0	My God will reject the people of Israelbecause they will not listen or obey.They will be wanderers , homeless among the nations .
