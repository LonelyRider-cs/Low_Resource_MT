21:3:001:1	A Time for Everything
21:3:001:0	For everything there is a season , a time for every activity under heaven .
21:3:002:0	A time to be born and a time to die.A time to plant and a time to harvest .
21:3:003:0	A time to kill and a time to heal.A time to tear down and a time to build up .
21:3:004:0	A time to cry and a time to laugh.A time to grieve and a time to dance .
21:3:005:0	A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones.A time to embrace and a time to turn away .
21:3:006:0	A time to search and a time to quit searching.A time to keep and a time to throw away .
21:3:007:0	A time to tear and a time to mend.A time to be quiet and a time to speak .
21:3:008:0	A time to love and a time to hate.A time for war and a time for peace .
21:3:009:0	What do people really get for all their hard work ?
21:3:010:0	I have seen the burden God has placed on us all .
21:3:011:0	Yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time . He has planted eternity in the human heart , but even so , people can not see the whole scope of God 's work from beginning to end .
21:3:012:0	So I concluded there is nothing better than to be happy and enjoy ourselves as long as we can .
21:3:013:0	And people should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor , for these are gifts from God .
21:3:014:0	And I know that whatever God does is final . Nothing can be added to it or taken from it . God 's purpose is that people should fear him .
21:3:002:1	The Injustices of Life
21:3:015:0	What is happening now has happened before , and what will happen in the future has happened before , because God makes the same things happen over and over again .
21:3:016:0	I also noticed that under the sun there is evil in the courtroom . Yes , even the courts of law are corrupt !
21:3:017:0	I said to myself , “ In due season God will judge everyone , both good and bad , for all their deeds . ”
21:3:018:0	I also thought about the human condition — how God proves to people that they are like animals .
21:3:019:0	For people and animals share the same fate — both breathe and both must die . So people have no real advantage over the animals . How meaningless !
21:3:020:0	Both go to the same place — they came from dust and they return to dust .
21:3:021:0	For who can prove that the human spirit goes up and the spirit of animals goes down into the earth ?
21:3:022:0	So I saw that there is nothing better for people than to be happy in their work . That is our lot in life . And no one can bring us back to see what happens after we die .
