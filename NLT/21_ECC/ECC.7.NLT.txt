21:7:001:1	Wisdom for Life
21:7:001:0	A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume.And the day you die is better than the day you are born .
21:7:002:0	Better to spend your time at funerals than at parties.After all , everyone dies — so the living should take this to heart .
21:7:003:0	Sorrow is better than laughter , for sadness has a refining influence on us .
21:7:004:0	A wise person thinks a lot about death , while a fool thinks only about having a good time .
21:7:005:0	Better to be criticized by a wise personthan to be praised by a fool .
21:7:006:0	A fool 's laughter is quickly gone , like thorns crackling in a fire.This also is meaningless .
21:7:007:0	Extortion turns wise people into fools , and bribes corrupt the heart .
21:7:008:0	Finishing is better than starting.Patience is better than pride .
21:7:009:0	Control your temper , for anger labels you a fool .
21:7:010:0	Do n't long for “ the good old days. ” This is not wise .
21:7:011:0	Wisdom is even better when you have money.Both are a benefit as you go through life .
21:7:012:0	Wisdom and money can get you almost anything , but only wisdom can save your life .
21:7:013:0	Accept the way God does things , for who can straighten what he has made crooked ?
21:7:002:1	The Limits of Human Wisdom
21:7:014:0	Enjoy prosperity while you can , but when hard times strike , realize that both come from God.Remember that nothing is certain in this life .
21:7:015:0	I have seen everything in this meaningless life , including the death of good young people and the long life of wicked people .
21:7:016:0	So do n't be too good or too wise ! Why destroy yourself ?
21:7:017:0	On the other hand , do n't be too wicked either . Do n't be a fool ! Why die before your time ?
21:7:018:0	Pay attention to these instructions , for anyone who fears God will avoid both extremes .
21:7:019:0	One wise person is stronger than ten leading citizens of a town !
21:7:020:0	Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins .
21:7:021:0	Do n't eavesdrop on others — you may hear your servant curse you .
21:7:022:0	For you know how often you yourself have cursed others .
21:7:023:0	I have always tried my best to let wisdom guide my thoughts and actions . I said to myself , “ I am determined to be wise. ” But it did n't work .
21:7:024:0	Wisdom is always distant and difficult to find .
21:7:025:0	I searched everywhere , determined to find wisdom and to understand the reason for things . I was determined to prove to myself that wickedness is stupid and that foolishness is madness .
21:7:026:0	I discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death . Her passion is a snare , and her soft hands are chains . Those who are pleasing to God will escape her , but sinners will be caught in her snare .
21:7:027:0	“ This is my conclusion , ” says the Teacher . “ I discovered this after looking at the matter from every possible angle .
21:7:028:0	Though I have searched repeatedly , I have not found what I was looking for . Only one out of a thousand men is virtuous , but not one woman !
21:7:029:0	But I did find this : God created people to be virtuous , but they have each turned to follow their own downward path . ”
