21:2:001:1	The Futility of Pleasure
21:2:001:0	I said to myself , “ Come on , let 's try pleasure . Let 's look for the ‘ good things ' in life. ” But I found that this , too , was meaningless .
21:2:002:0	So I said , “ Laughter is silly . What good does it do to seek pleasure ? ”
21:2:003:0	After much thought , I decided to cheer myself with wine . And while still seeking wisdom , I clutched at foolishness . In this way , I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world .
21:2:004:0	I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards .
21:2:005:0	I made gardens and parks , filling them with all kinds of fruit trees .
21:2:006:0	I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves .
21:2:007:0	I bought slaves , both men and women , and others were born into my household . I also owned large herds and flocks , more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me .
21:2:008:0	I collected great sums of silver and gold , the treasure of many kings and provinces . I hired wonderful singers , both men and women , and had many beautiful concubines . I had everything a man could desire !
21:2:009:0	So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me , and my wisdom never failed me .
21:2:010:0	Anything I wanted , I would take . I denied myself no pleasure . I even found great pleasure in hard work , a reward for all my labors .
21:2:002:1	The Wise and the Foolish
21:2:011:0	But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish , it was all so meaningless — like chasing the wind . There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere .
21:2:012:0	So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness ( for who can do this better than I , the king ? ) .
21:2:013:0	I thought , “ Wisdom is better than foolishness , just as light is better than darkness .
21:2:014:0	For the wise can see where they are going , but fools walk in the dark. ” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate .
21:2:015:0	Both will die . So I said to myself , “ Since I will end up the same as the fool , what 's the value of all my wisdom ? This is all so meaningless ! ”
21:2:016:0	For the wise and the foolish both die . The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool . In the days to come , both will be forgotten .
21:2:003:1	The Futility of Work
21:2:017:0	So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling . Everything is meaningless — like chasing the wind .
21:2:018:0	I came to hate all my hard work here on earth , for I must leave to others everything I have earned .
21:2:019:0	And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish ? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun . How meaningless !
21:2:020:0	So I gave up in despair , questioning the value of all my hard work in this world .
21:2:021:0	Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill , then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who has n't worked for it . This , too , is meaningless , a great tragedy .
21:2:022:0	So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety ?
21:2:023:0	Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief ; even at night their minds can not rest . It is all meaningless .
21:2:024:0	So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work . Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God .
21:2:025:0	For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him ?
21:2:026:0	God gives wisdom , knowledge , and joy to those who please him . But if a sinner becomes wealthy , God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him . This , too , is meaningless — like chasing the wind .
