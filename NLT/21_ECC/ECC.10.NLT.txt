21:10:001:0	As dead flies cause even a bottle of perfume to stink , so a little foolishness spoils great wisdom and honor .
21:10:002:0	A wise person chooses the right road ; a fool takes the wrong one .
21:10:003:0	You can identify foolsjust by the way they walk down the street !
21:10:001:1	The Ironies of Life
21:10:004:0	If your boss is angry at you , do n't quit ! A quiet spirit can overcome even great mistakes .
21:10:005:0	There is another evil I have seen under the sun . Kings and rulers make a grave mistake
21:10:006:0	when they give great authority to foolish people and low positions to people of proven worth .
21:10:007:0	I have even seen servants riding horseback like princes â€” and princes walking like servants !
21:10:008:0	When you dig a well , you might fall in.When you demolish an old wall , you could be bitten by a snake .
21:10:009:0	When you work in a quarry , stones might fall and crush you.When you chop wood , there is danger with each stroke of your ax .
21:10:010:0	Using a dull ax requires great strength , so sharpen the blade.That 's the value of wisdom ; it helps you succeed .
21:10:011:0	If a snake bites before you charm it , what 's the use of being a snake charmer ?
21:10:012:0	Wise words bring approval , but fools are destroyed by their own words .
21:10:013:0	Fools base their thoughts on foolish assumptions , so their conclusions will be wicked madness ;
21:10:014:0	they chatter on and on.No one really knows what is going to happen ; no one can predict the future .
21:10:015:0	Fools are so exhausted by a little workthat they ca n't even find their way home .
21:10:016:0	What sorrow for the land ruled by a servant , the land whose leaders feast in the morning .
21:10:017:0	Happy is the land whose king is a noble leaderand whose leaders feast at the proper timeto gain strength for their work , not to get drunk .
21:10:018:0	Laziness leads to a sagging roof ; idleness leads to a leaky house .
21:10:019:0	A party gives laughter , wine gives happiness , and money gives everything !
21:10:020:0	Never make light of the king , even in your thoughts.And do n't make fun of the powerful , even in your own bedroom.For a little bird might deliver your messageand tell them what you said .
