21:12:001:0	Do n't let the excitement of youth cause you to forget your Creator . Honor him in your youth before you grow old and say , “ Life is not pleasant anymore . ”
21:12:002:0	Remember him before the light of the sun , moon , and stars is dim to your old eyes , and rain clouds continually darken your sky .
21:12:003:0	Remember him before your legs — the guards of your house — start to tremble ; and before your shoulders — the strong men — stoop . Remember him before your teeth — your few remaining servants — stop grinding ; and before your eyes — the women looking through the windows — see dimly .
21:12:004:0	Remember him before the door to life 's opportunities is closed and the sound of work fades . Now you rise at the first chirping of the birds , but then all their sounds will grow faint .
21:12:005:0	Remember him before you become fearful of falling and worry about danger in the streets ; before your hair turns white like an almond tree in bloom , and you drag along without energy like a dying grasshopper , and the caperberry no longer inspires sexual desire . Remember him before you near the grave , your everlasting home , when the mourners will weep at your funeral .
21:12:006:0	Yes , remember your Creator now while you are young , before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken . Do n't wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well .
21:12:001:1	Concluding Thoughts about the Teacher
21:12:007:0	For then the dust will return to the earth , and the spirit will return to God who gave it .
21:12:008:0	“ Everything is meaningless , ” says the Teacher , “ completely meaningless . ”
21:12:009:0	Keep this in mind : The Teacher was considered wise , and he taught the people everything he knew . He listened carefully to many proverbs , studying and classifying them .
21:12:010:0	The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly .
21:12:011:0	The words of the wise are like cattle prods — painful but helpful . Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd drives the sheep .
21:12:012:0	But , my child , let me give you some further advice : Be careful , for writing books is endless , and much study wears you out .
21:12:013:0	That 's the whole story . Here now is my final conclusion : Fear God and obey his commands , for this is everyone 's duty .
21:12:014:0	God will judge us for everything we do , including every secret thing , whether good or bad .
