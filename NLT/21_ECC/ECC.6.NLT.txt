21:6:001:0	There is another serious tragedy I have seen under the sun , and it weighs heavily on humanity .
21:6:002:0	God gives some people great wealth and honor and everything they could ever want , but then he does n't give them the chance to enjoy these things . They die , and someone else , even a stranger , ends up enjoying their wealth ! This is meaningless — a sickening tragedy .
21:6:003:0	A man might have a hundred children and live to be very old . But if he finds no satisfaction in life and does n't even get a decent burial , it would have been better for him to be born dead .
21:6:004:0	His birth would have been meaningless , and he would have ended in darkness . He would n't even have had a name ,
21:6:005:0	and he would never have seen the sun or known of its existence . Yet he would have had more peace than in growing up to be an unhappy man .
21:6:006:0	He might live a thousand years twice over but still not find contentment . And since he must die like everyone else — well , what 's the use ?
21:6:007:0	All people spend their lives scratching for food , but they never seem to have enough .
21:6:008:0	So are wise people really better off than fools ? Do poor people gain anything by being wise and knowing how to act in front of others ?
21:6:001:1	The Future — Determined and Unknown
21:6:009:0	Enjoy what you have rather than desiring what you do n't have . Just dreaming about nice things is meaningless — like chasing the wind .
21:6:010:0	Everything has already been decided . It was known long ago what each person would be . So there 's no use arguing with God about your destiny .
21:6:011:0	The more words you speak , the less they mean . So what good are they ?
21:6:012:0	In the few days of our meaningless lives , who knows how our days can best be spent ? Our lives are like a shadow . Who can tell what will happen on this earth after we are gone ?
