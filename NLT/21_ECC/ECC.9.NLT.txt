21:9:001:1	Death Comes to All
21:9:001:0	This , too , I carefully explored : Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God 's hands , no one knows whether God will show them favor .
21:9:002:0	The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone , whether righteous or wicked , good or bad , ceremonially clean or unclean , religious or irreligious . Good people receive the same treatment as sinners , and people who make promises to God are treated like people who do n't .
21:9:003:0	It seems so wrong that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate . Already twisted by evil , people choose their own mad course , for they have no hope . There is nothing ahead but death anyway .
21:9:004:0	There is hope only for the living . As they say , “ It 's better to be a live dog than a dead lion ! ”
21:9:005:0	The living at least know they will die , but the dead know nothing . They have no further reward , nor are they remembered .
21:9:006:0	Whatever they did in their lifetime — loving , hating , envying — is all long gone . They no longer play a part in anything here on earth .
21:9:007:0	So go ahead . Eat your food with joy , and drink your wine with a happy heart , for God approves of this !
21:9:008:0	Wear fine clothes , with a splash of cologne !
21:9:009:0	Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun . The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil .
21:9:010:0	Whatever you do , do well . For when you go to the grave , there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom .
21:9:011:0	I have observed something else under the sun . The fastest runner does n't always win the race , and the strongest warrior does n't always win the battle . The wise sometimes go hungry , and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy . And those who are educated do n't always lead successful lives . It is all decided by chance , by being in the right place at the right time .
21:9:002:1	Thoughts on Wisdom and Folly
21:9:012:0	People can never predict when hard times might come . Like fish in a net or birds in a trap , people are caught by sudden tragedy .
21:9:013:0	Here is another bit of wisdom that has impressed me as I have watched the way our world works .
21:9:014:0	There was a small town with only a few people , and a great king came with his army and besieged it .
21:9:015:0	A poor , wise man knew how to save the town , and so it was rescued . But afterward no one thought to thank him .
21:9:016:0	So even though wisdom is better than strength , those who are wise will be despised if they are poor . What they say will not be appreciated for long .
21:9:017:0	Better to hear the quiet words of a wise personthan the shouts of a foolish king .
21:9:018:0	Better to have wisdom than weapons of war , but one sinner can destroy much that is good .
