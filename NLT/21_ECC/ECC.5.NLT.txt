21:5:001:1	Approaching God with Care
21:5:001:0	As you enter the house of God , keep your ears open and your mouth shut . It is evil to make mindless offerings to God .
21:5:002:0	Do n't make rash promises , and do n't be hasty in bringing matters before God . After all , God is in heaven , and you are here on earth . So let your words be few .
21:5:003:0	Too much activity gives you restless dreams ; too many words make you a fool .
21:5:004:0	When you make a promise to God , do n't delay in following through , for God takes no pleasure in fools . Keep all the promises you make to him .
21:5:005:0	It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it .
21:5:006:0	Do n't let your mouth make you sin . And do n't defend yourself by telling the Temple messenger that the promise you made was a mistake . That would make God angry , and he might wipe out everything you have achieved .
21:5:002:1	The Futility of Wealth
21:5:007:0	Talk is cheap , like daydreams and other useless activities . Fear God instead .
21:5:008:0	Do n't be surprised if you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful and if justice is being miscarried throughout the land . For every official is under orders from higher up , and matters of justice get lost in red tape and bureaucracy .
21:5:009:0	Even the king milks the land for his own profit !
21:5:010:0	Those who love money will never have enough . How meaningless to think that wealth brings true happiness !
21:5:011:0	The more you have , the more people come to help you spend it . So what good is wealth—except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers !
21:5:012:0	People who work hard sleep well , whether they eat little or much . But the rich seldom get a good night 's sleep .
21:5:013:0	There is another serious problem I have seen under the sun . Hoarding riches harms the saver .
21:5:014:0	Money is put into risky investments that turn sour , and everything is lost . In the end , there is nothing left to pass on to one 's children .
21:5:015:0	We all come to the end of our lives as naked and empty-handed as on the day we were born . We ca n't take our riches with us .
21:5:016:0	And this , too , is a very serious problem . People leave this world no better off than when they came . All their hard work is for nothing—like working for the wind .
21:5:017:0	Throughout their lives , they live under a cloud—frustrated , discouraged , and angry .
21:5:018:0	Even so , I have noticed one thing , at least , that is good . It is good for people to eat , drink , and enjoy their work under the sun during the short life God has given them , and to accept their lot in life .
21:5:019:0	And it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it . To enjoy your work and accept your lot in life—this is indeed a gift from God .
21:5:020:0	God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to brood over the past .
