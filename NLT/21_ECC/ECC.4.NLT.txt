21:4:001:0	Again , I observed all the oppression that takes place under the sun . I saw the tears of the oppressed , with no one to comfort them . The oppressors have great power , and their victims are helpless .
21:4:002:0	So I concluded that the dead are better off than the living .
21:4:003:0	But most fortunate of all are those who are not yet born . For they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun .
21:4:004:0	Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors . But this , too , is meaningless — like chasing the wind .
21:4:005:0	“ Fools fold their idle hands , leading them to ruin . ”
21:4:001:1	The Advantages of Companionship
21:4:006:0	And yet , “ Better to have one handful with quietnessthan two handfuls with hard workand chasing the wind . ”
21:4:007:0	I observed yet another example of something meaningless under the sun .
21:4:008:0	This is the case of a man who is all alone , without a child or a brother , yet who works hard to gain as much wealth as he can . But then he asks himself , “ Who am I working for ? Why am I giving up so much pleasure now ? ” It is all so meaningless and depressing .
21:4:009:0	Two people are better off than one , for they can help each other succeed .
21:4:010:0	If one person falls , the other can reach out and help . But someone who falls alone is in real trouble .
21:4:011:0	Likewise , two people lying close together can keep each other warm . But how can one be warm alone ?
21:4:002:1	The Futility of Political Power
21:4:012:0	A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated , but two can stand back-to-back and conquer . Three are even better , for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken .
21:4:013:0	It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who refuses all advice .
21:4:014:0	Such a youth could rise from poverty and succeed . He might even become king , though he has been in prison .
21:4:015:0	But then everyone rushes to the side of yet another youth who replaces him .
21:4:016:0	Endless crowds stand around him , but then another generation grows up and rejects him , too . So it is all meaningless — like chasing the wind .
