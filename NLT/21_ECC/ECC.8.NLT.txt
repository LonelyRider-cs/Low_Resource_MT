21:8:001:1	Obedience to the King
21:8:001:0	How wonderful to be wise , to analyze and interpret things.Wisdom lights up a person 's face , softening its harshness .
21:8:002:0	Obey the king since you vowed to God that you would .
21:8:003:0	Do n't try to avoid doing your duty , and do n't stand with those who plot evil , for the king can do whatever he wants .
21:8:004:0	His command is backed by great power . No one can resist or question it .
21:8:005:0	Those who obey him will not be punished . Those who are wise will find a time and a way to do what is right ,
21:8:006:0	for there is a time and a way for everything , even when a person is in trouble .
21:8:007:0	Indeed , how can people avoid what they do n't know is going to happen ?
21:8:002:1	The Wicked and the Righteous
21:8:008:0	None of us can hold back our spirit from departing . None of us has the power to prevent the day of our death . There is no escaping that obligation , that dark battle . And in the face of death , wickedness will certainly not rescue the wicked .
21:8:009:0	I have thought deeply about all that goes on here under the sun , where people have the power to hurt each other .
21:8:010:0	I have seen wicked people buried with honor . Yet they were the very ones who frequented the Temple and are now praised in the same city where they committed their crimes ! This , too , is meaningless .
21:8:011:0	When a crime is not punished quickly , people feel it is safe to do wrong .
21:8:012:0	But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time , I know that those who fear God will be better off .
21:8:013:0	The wicked will not prosper , for they do not fear God . Their days will never grow long like the evening shadows .
21:8:014:0	And this is not all that is meaningless in our world . In this life , good people are often treated as though they were wicked , and wicked people are often treated as though they were good . This is so meaningless !
21:8:015:0	So I recommend having fun , because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat , drink , and enjoy life . That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun .
21:8:016:0	In my search for wisdom and in my observation of people 's burdens here on earth , I discovered that there is ceaseless activity , day and night .
21:8:017:0	I realized that no one can discover everything God is doing under the sun . Not even the wisest people discover everything , no matter what they claim .
