21:1:001:1	Everything Is Meaningless
21:1:001:0	These are the words of the Teacher , King David 's son , who ruled in Jerusalem .
21:1:002:0	“ Everything is meaningless , ” says the Teacher , “ completely meaningless ! ”
21:1:003:0	What do people get for all their hard work under the sun ?
21:1:004:0	Generations come and generations go , but the earth never changes .
21:1:005:0	The sun rises and the sun sets , then hurries around to rise again .
21:1:006:0	The wind blows south , and then turns north . Around and around it goes , blowing in circles .
21:1:007:0	Rivers run into the sea , but the sea is never full . Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea .
21:1:008:0	Everything is wearisome beyond description . No matter how much we see , we are never satisfied . No matter how much we hear , we are not content .
21:1:009:0	History merely repeats itself . It has all been done before . Nothing under the sun is truly new .
21:1:010:0	Sometimes people say , “ Here is something new ! ” But actually it is old ; nothing is ever truly new .
21:1:002:1	The Teacher Speaks : The Futility of Wisdom
21:1:011:0	We do n't remember what happened in the past , and in future generations , no one will remember what we are doing now .
21:1:012:0	I , the Teacher , was king of Israel , and I lived in Jerusalem .
21:1:013:0	I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven . I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race .
21:1:014:0	I observed everything going on under the sun , and really , it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind .
21:1:015:0	What is wrong can not be made right.What is missing can not be recovered .
21:1:016:0	I said to myself , “ Look , I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me . I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them . ”
21:1:017:0	So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly . But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind .
21:1:018:0	The greater my wisdom , the greater my grief.To increase knowledge only increases sorrow .
