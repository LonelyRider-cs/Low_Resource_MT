1:23:001:1	The Burial of Sarah
1:23:001:0	When Sarah was 127 years old ,
1:23:002:0	she died at Kiriath-arba ( now called Hebron ) in the land of Canaan . There Abraham mourned and wept for her .
1:23:003:0	Then , leaving her body , he said to the Hittite elders ,
1:23:004:0	“ Here I am , a stranger and a foreigner among you . Please sell me a piece of land so I can give my wife a proper burial . ”
1:23:005:0	The Hittites replied to Abraham ,
1:23:006:0	“ Listen , my lord , you are an honored prince among us . Choose the finest of our tombs and bury her there . No one here will refuse to help you in this way . ”
1:23:007:0	Then Abraham bowed low before the Hittites
1:23:008:0	and said , “ Since you are willing to help me in this way , be so kind as to ask Ephron son of Zohar
1:23:009:0	to let me buy his cave at Machpelah , down at the end of his field . I will pay the full price in the presence of witnesses , so I will have a permanent burial place for my family . ”
1:23:010:0	Ephron was sitting there among the others , and he answered Abraham as the others listened , speaking publicly before all the Hittite elders of the town .
1:23:011:0	“ No , my lord , ” he said to Abraham , “ please listen to me . I will give you the field and the cave . Here in the presence of my people , I give it to you . Go and bury your dead . ”
1:23:012:0	Abraham again bowed low before the citizens of the land ,
1:23:013:0	and he replied to Ephron as everyone listened . “ No , listen to me . I will buy it from you . Let me pay the full price for the field so I can bury my dead there . ”
1:23:014:0	Ephron answered Abraham ,
1:23:015:0	“ My lord , please listen to me . The land is worth 400 pieces of silver , but what is that between friends ? Go ahead and bury your dead . ”
1:23:016:0	So Abraham agreed to Ephron 's price and paid the amount he had suggested — 400 pieces of silver , weighed according to the market standard . The Hittite elders witnessed the transaction .
1:23:017:0	So Abraham bought the plot of land belonging to Ephron at Machpelah , near Mamre . This included the field itself , the cave that was in it , and all the surrounding trees .
1:23:018:0	It was transferred to Abraham as his permanent possession in the presence of the Hittite elders at the city gate .
1:23:019:0	Then Abraham buried his wife , Sarah , there in Canaan , in the cave of Machpelah , near Mamre ( also called Hebron ) .
1:23:020:0	So the field and the cave were transferred from the Hittites to Abraham for use as a permanent burial place .
