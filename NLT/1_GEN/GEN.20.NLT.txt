1:20:001:1	Abraham Deceives Abimelech
1:20:001:0	Abraham moved south to the Negev and lived for a while between Kadesh and Shur , and then he moved on to Gerar . While living there as a foreigner ,
1:20:002:0	Abraham introduced his wife , Sarah , by saying , “ She is my sister. ” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for Sarah and had her brought to him at his palace .
1:20:003:0	But that night God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him , “ You are a dead man , for that woman you have taken is already married ! ”
1:20:004:0	But Abimelech had not slept with her yet , so he said , “ Lord , will you destroy an innocent nation ?
1:20:005:0	Did n't Abraham tell me , ‘ She is my sister ' ? And she herself said , ‘ Yes , he is my brother . ' I acted in complete innocence ! My hands are clean . ”
1:20:006:0	In the dream God responded , “ Yes , I know you are innocent . That 's why I kept you from sinning against me , and why I did not let you touch her .
1:20:007:0	Now return the woman to her husband , and he will pray for you , for he is a prophet . Then you will live . But if you do n't return her to him , you can be sure that you and all your people will die . ”
1:20:008:0	Abimelech got up early the next morning and quickly called all his servants together . When he told them what had happened , his men were terrified .
1:20:009:0	Then Abimelech called for Abraham . “ What have you done to us ? ” he demanded . “ What crime have I committed that deserves treatment like this , making me and my kingdom guilty of this great sin ? No one should ever do what you have done !
1:20:010:0	Whatever possessed you to do such a thing ? ”
1:20:011:0	Abraham replied , “ I thought , ‘ This is a godless place . They will want my wife and will kill me to get her . '
1:20:012:0	And she really is my sister , for we both have the same father , but different mothers . And I married her .
1:20:013:0	When God called me to leave my father 's home and to travel from place to place , I told her , ‘ Do me a favor . Wherever we go , tell the people that I am your brother . ' ”
1:20:014:0	Then Abimelech took some of his sheep and goats , cattle , and male and female servants , and he presented them to Abraham . He also returned his wife , Sarah , to him .
1:20:015:0	Then Abimelech said , “ Look over my land and choose any place where you would like to live . ”
1:20:016:0	And he said to Sarah , “ Look , I am giving your ‘ brother ' 1,000 pieces of silver in the presence of all these witnesses . This is to compensate you for any wrong I may have done to you . This will settle any claim against me , and your reputation is cleared . ”
1:20:017:0	Then Abraham prayed to God , and God healed Abimelech , his wife , and his female servants , so they could have children .
1:20:018:0	For the Lord had caused all the women to be infertile because of what happened with Abraham 's wife , Sarah .
