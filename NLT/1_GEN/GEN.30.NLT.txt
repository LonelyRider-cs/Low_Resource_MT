1:30:001:0	When Rachel saw that she was n't having any children for Jacob , she became jealous of her sister . She pleaded with Jacob , “ Give me children , or I 'll die ! ”
1:30:002:0	Then Jacob became furious with Rachel . “ Am I God ? ” he asked . “ He 's the one who has kept you from having children ! ”
1:30:003:0	Then Rachel told him , “ Take my maid , Bilhah , and sleep with her . She will bear children for me , and through her I can have a family , too . ”
1:30:004:0	So Rachel gave her servant , Bilhah , to Jacob as a wife , and he slept with her .
1:30:005:0	Bilhah became pregnant and presented him with a son .
1:30:006:0	Rachel named him Dan , for she said , “ God has vindicated me ! He has heard my request and given me a son . ”
1:30:007:0	Then Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son .
1:30:008:0	Rachel named him Naphtali , for she said , “ I have struggled hard with my sister , and I 'm winning ! ”
1:30:009:0	Meanwhile , Leah realized that she was n't getting pregnant anymore , so she took her servant , Zilpah , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
1:30:010:0	Soon Zilpah presented him with a son .
1:30:011:0	Leah named him Gad , for she said , “ How fortunate I am ! ”
1:30:012:0	Then Zilpah gave Jacob a second son .
1:30:013:0	And Leah named him Asher , for she said , “ What joy is mine ! Now the other women will celebrate with me . ”
1:30:014:0	One day during the wheat harvest , Reuben found some mandrakes growing in a field and brought them to his mother , Leah . Rachel begged Leah , “ Please give me some of your son 's mandrakes . ”
1:30:015:0	But Leah angrily replied , “ Was n't it enough that you stole my husband ? Now will you steal my son 's mandrakes , too ? ” Rachel answered , “ I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes . ”
1:30:016:0	So that evening , as Jacob was coming home from the fields , Leah went out to meet him . “ You must come and sleep with me tonight ! ” she said . “ I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found. ” So that night he slept with Leah .
1:30:017:0	And God answered Leah 's prayers . She became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob .
1:30:018:0	She named him Issachar , for she said , “ God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband as a wife . ”
1:30:019:0	Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob .
1:30:020:0	She named him Zebulun , for she said , “ God has given me a good reward . Now my husband will treat me with respect , for I have given him six sons . ”
1:30:021:0	Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah .
1:30:022:0	Then God remembered Rachel 's plight and answered her prayers by enabling her to have children .
1:30:023:0	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son . “ God has removed my disgrace , ” she said .
1:30:001:1	Jacob 's Wealth Increases
1:30:024:0	And she named him Joseph , for she said , “ May the Lord add yet another son to my family . ”
1:30:025:0	Soon after Rachel had given birth to Joseph , Jacob said to Laban , “ Please release me so I can go home to my own country .
1:30:026:0	Let me take my wives and children , for I have earned them by serving you , and let me be on my way . You certainly know how hard I have worked for you . ”
1:30:027:0	“ Please listen to me , ” Laban replied . “ I have become wealthy , for the Lord has blessed me because of you .
1:30:028:0	Tell me how much I owe you . Whatever it is , I 'll pay it . ”
1:30:029:0	Jacob replied , “ You know how hard I 've worked for you , and how your flocks and herds have grown under my care .
1:30:030:0	You had little indeed before I came , but your wealth has increased enormously . The Lord has blessed you through everything I 've done . But now , what about me ? When can I start providing for my own family ? ”
1:30:031:0	“ What wages do you want ? ” Laban asked again.Jacob replied , “ Do n't give me anything . Just do this one thing , and I 'll continue to tend and watch over your flocks .
1:30:032:0	Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted , along with all the black sheep . Give these to me as my wages .
1:30:033:0	In the future , when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages , you 'll see that I have been honest . If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots , or any sheep that are not black , you will know that I have stolen them from you . ”
1:30:034:0	“ All right , ” Laban replied . “ It will be as you say . ”
1:30:035:0	But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted , all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches , and all the black sheep . He placed them in the care of his own sons ,
1:30:036:0	who took them a three-days ' journey from where Jacob was . Meanwhile , Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban 's flock .
1:30:037:0	Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar , almond , and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark , making white streaks on them .
1:30:038:0	Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink , for that was where they mated .
1:30:039:0	And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches , they gave birth to young that were streaked , speckled , and spotted .
1:30:040:0	Jacob separated those lambs from Laban 's flock . And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban 's animals that were streaked or black . This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban 's .
1:30:041:0	Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate , Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them . Then they would mate in front of the branches .
1:30:042:0	But he did n't do this with the weaker ones , so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban , and the stronger ones were Jacob 's .
1:30:043:0	As a result , Jacob became very wealthy , with large flocks of sheep and goats , female and male servants , and many camels and donkeys .
