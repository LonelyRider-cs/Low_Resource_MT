1:3:001:1	The Man and Woman Sin
1:3:001:0	The serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild animals the Lord God had made . One day he asked the woman , “ Did God really say you must not eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden ? ”
1:3:002:0	“ Of course we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden , ” the woman replied .
1:3:003:0	“ It 's only the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden that we are not allowed to eat . God said , ‘ You must not eat it or even touch it ; if you do , you will die . ' ”
1:3:004:0	“ You wo n't die ! ” the serpent replied to the woman .
1:3:005:0	“ God knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it , and you will be like God , knowing both good and evil . ”
1:3:006:0	The woman was convinced . She saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious , and she wanted the wisdom it would give her . So she took some of the fruit and ate it . Then she gave some to her husband , who was with her , and he ate it , too .
1:3:007:0	At that moment their eyes were opened , and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness . So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves .
1:3:008:0	When the cool evening breezes were blowing , the man and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden . So they hid from the Lord God among the trees .
1:3:009:0	Then the Lord God called to the man , “ Where are you ? ”
1:3:010:0	He replied , “ I heard you walking in the garden , so I hid . I was afraid because I was naked . ”
1:3:011:0	“ Who told you that you were naked ? ” the Lord God asked . “ Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat ? ”
1:3:012:0	The man replied , “ It was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit , and I ate it . ”
1:3:013:0	Then the Lord God asked the woman , “ What have you done ? ” “ The serpent deceived me , ” she replied . “ That 's why I ate it . ”
1:3:014:0	Then the Lord God said to the serpent , “ Because you have done this , you are cursedmore than all animals , domestic and wild.You will crawl on your belly , groveling in the dust as long as you live .
1:3:015:0	And I will cause hostility between you and the woman , and between your offspring and her offspring.He will strike your head , and you will strike his heel . ”
1:3:016:0	Then he said to the woman , “ I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy , and in pain you will give birth.And you will desire to control your husband , but he will rule over you . ”
1:3:017:0	And to the man he said , “ Since you listened to your wife and ate from the treewhose fruit I commanded you not to eat , the ground is cursed because of you.All your life you will struggle to scratch a living from it .
1:3:018:0	It will grow thorns and thistles for you , though you will eat of its grains .
1:3:002:1	Paradise Lost : God 's Judgment
1:3:019:0	By the sweat of your browwill you have food to eatuntil you return to the groundfrom which you were made.For you were made from dust , and to dust you will return . ”
1:3:020:0	Then the man — Adam — named his wife Eve , because she would be the mother of all who live .
1:3:021:0	And the Lord God made clothing from animal skins for Adam and his wife .
1:3:022:0	Then the Lord God said , “ Look , the human beings have become like us , knowing both good and evil . What if they reach out , take fruit from the tree of life , and eat it ? Then they will live forever ! ”
1:3:023:0	So the Lord God banished them from the Garden of Eden , and he sent Adam out to cultivate the ground from which he had been made .
1:3:024:0	After sending them out , the Lord God stationed mighty cherubim to the east of the Garden of Eden . And he placed a flaming sword that flashed back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life .
