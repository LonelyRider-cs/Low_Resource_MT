1:40:001:1	Joseph Interprets Two Dreams
1:40:001:0	Some time later , Pharaoh 's chief cup-bearer and chief baker offended their royal master .
1:40:002:0	Pharaoh became angry with these two officials ,
1:40:003:0	and he put them in the prison where Joseph was , in the palace of the captain of the guard .
1:40:004:0	They remained in prison for quite some time , and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , who looked after them .
1:40:005:0	While they were in prison , Pharaoh 's cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night , and each dream had its own meaning .
1:40:006:0	When Joseph saw them the next morning , he noticed that they both looked upset .
1:40:007:0	“ Why do you look so worried today ? ” he asked them .
1:40:008:0	And they replied , “ We both had dreams last night , but no one can tell us what they mean. ” “ Interpreting dreams is God 's business , ” Joseph replied . “ Go ahead and tell me your dreams . ”
1:40:009:0	So the chief cup-bearer told Joseph his dream first . “ In my dream , ” he said , “ I saw a grapevine in front of me .
1:40:010:0	The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom , and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes .
1:40:011:0	I was holding Pharaoh 's wine cup in my hand , so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup . Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh 's hand . ”
1:40:012:0	“ This is what the dream means , ” Joseph said . “ The three branches represent three days .
1:40:013:0	Within three days Pharaoh will lift you up and restore you to your position as his chief cup-bearer .
1:40:014:0	And please remember me and do me a favor when things go well for you . Mention me to Pharaoh , so he might let me out of this place .
1:40:015:0	For I was kidnapped from my homeland , the land of the Hebrews , and now I 'm here in prison , but I did nothing to deserve it . ”
1:40:016:0	When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given the first dream such a positive interpretation , he said to Joseph , “ I had a dream , too . In my dream there were three baskets of white pastries stacked on my head .
1:40:017:0	The top basket contained all kinds of pastries for Pharaoh , but the birds came and ate them from the basket on my head . ”
1:40:018:0	“ This is what the dream means , ” Joseph told him . “ The three baskets also represent three days .
1:40:019:0	Three days from now Pharaoh will lift you up and impale your body on a pole . Then birds will come and peck away at your flesh . ”
1:40:020:0	Pharaoh 's birthday came three days later , and he prepared a banquet for all his officials and staff . He summoned his chief cup-bearer and chief baker to join the other officials .
1:40:021:0	He then restored the chief cup-bearer to his former position , so he could again hand Pharaoh his cup .
1:40:022:0	But Pharaoh impaled the chief baker , just as Joseph had predicted when he interpreted his dream .
1:40:023:0	Pharaoh 's chief cup-bearer , however , forgot all about Joseph , never giving him another thought .
