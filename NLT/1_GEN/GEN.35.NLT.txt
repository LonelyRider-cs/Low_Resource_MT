1:35:001:1	Jacob 's Return to Bethel
1:35:001:0	Then God said to Jacob , “ Get ready and move to Bethel and settle there . Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother , Esau . ”
1:35:002:0	So Jacob told everyone in his household , “ Get rid of all your pagan idols , purify yourselves , and put on clean clothing .
1:35:003:0	We are now going to Bethel , where I will build an altar to the God who answered my prayers when I was in distress . He has been with me wherever I have gone . ”
1:35:004:0	So they gave Jacob all their pagan idols and earrings , and he buried them under the great tree near Shechem .
1:35:005:0	As they set out , a terror from God spread over the people in all the towns of that area , so no one attacked Jacob 's family .
1:35:006:0	Eventually , Jacob and his household arrived at Luz ( also called Bethel ) in Canaan .
1:35:007:0	Jacob built an altar there and named the place El-bethel ( which means “ God of Bethel ” ) , because God had appeared to him there when he was fleeing from his brother , Esau .
1:35:008:0	Soon after this , Rebekah 's old nurse , Deborah , died . She was buried beneath the oak tree in the valley below Bethel . Ever since , the tree has been called Allon-bacuth ( which means “ oak of weeping ” ) .
1:35:009:0	Now that Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram , God appeared to him again at Bethel . God blessed him ,
1:35:010:0	saying , “ Your name is Jacob , but you will not be called Jacob any longer . From now on your name will be Israel. ” So God renamed him Israel .
1:35:011:0	Then God said , “ I am El-Shaddai— ‘ God Almighty . ' Be fruitful and multiply . You will become a great nation , even many nations . Kings will be among your descendants !
1:35:012:0	And I will give you the land I once gave to Abraham and Isaac . Yes , I will give it to you and your descendants after you . ”
1:35:013:0	Then God went up from the place where he had spoken to Jacob .
1:35:014:0	Jacob set up a stone pillar to mark the place where God had spoken to him . Then he poured wine over it as an offering to God and anointed the pillar with olive oil .
1:35:002:1	The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac
1:35:015:0	And Jacob named the place Bethel ( which means “ house of God ” ) , because God had spoken to him there .
1:35:016:0	Leaving Bethel , Jacob and his clan moved on toward Ephrath . But Rachel went into labor while they were still some distance away . Her labor pains were intense .
1:35:017:0	After a very hard delivery , the midwife finally exclaimed , “ Do n't be afraid—you have another son ! ”
1:35:018:0	Rachel was about to die , but with her last breath she named the baby Ben-oni ( which means “ son of my sorrow ” ) . The baby 's father , however , called him Benjamin ( which means “ son of my right hand ” ) .
1:35:019:0	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) .
1:35:020:0	Jacob set up a stone monument over Rachel 's grave , and it can be seen there to this day .
1:35:021:0	Then Jacob traveled on and camped beyond Migdal-eder .
1:35:022:0	While he was living there , Reuben had intercourse with Bilhah , his father 's concubine , and Jacob soon heard about it.These are the names of the twelve sons of Jacob :
1:35:023:0	The sons of Leah were Reuben ( Jacob 's oldest son ) , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun .
1:35:024:0	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin .
1:35:025:0	The sons of Bilhah , Rachel 's servant , were Dan and Naphtali .
1:35:026:0	The sons of Zilpah , Leah 's servant , were Gad and Asher.These are the names of the sons who were born to Jacob at Paddan-aram .
1:35:027:0	So Jacob returned to his father , Isaac , in Mamre , which is near Kiriath-arba ( now called Hebron ) , where Abraham and Isaac had both lived as foreigners .
1:35:028:0	Isaac lived for 180 years .
1:35:029:0	Then he breathed his last and died at a ripe old age , joining his ancestors in death . And his sons , Esau and Jacob , buried him .
