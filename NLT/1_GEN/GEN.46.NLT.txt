1:46:001:1	Jacob 's Journey to Egypt
1:46:001:0	So Jacob set out for Egypt with all his possessions . And when he came to Beersheba , he offered sacrifices to the God of his father , Isaac .
1:46:002:0	During the night God spoke to him in a vision . “ Jacob ! Jacob ! ” he called. “ Here I am , ” Jacob replied .
1:46:003:0	“ I am God , the God of your father , ” the voice said . “ Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt , for there I will make your family into a great nation .
1:46:004:0	I will go with you down to Egypt , and I will bring you back again . You will die in Egypt , but Joseph will be with you to close your eyes . ”
1:46:005:0	So Jacob left Beersheba , and his sons took him to Egypt . They carried him and their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had provided for them .
1:46:006:0	They also took all their livestock and all the personal belongings they had acquired in the land of Canaan . So Jacob and his entire family went to Egypt —
1:46:007:0	sons and grandsons , daughters and granddaughters — all his descendants .

1:46:002:1	Jacob 's Family Arrives in Goshen
1:46:027:0	In addition , Joseph had two sons who were born in Egypt . So altogether , there were seventy members of Jacob 's family in the land of Egypt .
1:46:028:0	As they neared their destination , Jacob sent Judah ahead to meet Joseph and get directions to the region of Goshen . And when they finally arrived there ,
1:46:029:0	Joseph prepared his chariot and traveled to Goshen to meet his father , Jacob . When Joseph arrived , he embraced his father and wept , holding him for a long time .
1:46:030:0	Finally , Jacob said to Joseph , “ Now I am ready to die , since I have seen your face again and know you are still alive . ”
1:46:031:0	And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father 's entire family , “ I will go to Pharaoh and tell him , ‘ My brothers and my father 's entire family have come to me from the land of Canaan .
1:46:032:0	These men are shepherds , and they raise livestock . They have brought with them their flocks and herds and everything they own . ' ”
1:46:033:0	Then he said , “ When Pharaoh calls for you and asks you about your occupation ,
1:46:034:0	you must tell him , ‘ We , your servants , have raised livestock all our lives , as our ancestors have always done . ' When you tell him this , he will let you live here in the region of Goshen , for the Egyptians despise shepherds . ”
