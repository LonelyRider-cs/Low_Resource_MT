1:19:001:1	Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed
1:19:001:0	That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom . Lot was sitting there , and when he saw them , he stood up to meet them . Then he welcomed them and bowed with his face to the ground .
1:19:002:0	“ My lords , ” he said , “ come to my home to wash your feet , and be my guests for the night . You may then get up early in the morning and be on your way again. ” “ Oh no , ” they replied . “ We 'll just spend the night out here in the city square . ”
1:19:003:0	But Lot insisted , so at last they went home with him . Lot prepared a feast for them , complete with fresh bread made without yeast , and they ate .
1:19:004:0	But before they retired for the night , all the men of Sodom , young and old , came from all over the city and surrounded the house .
1:19:005:0	They shouted to Lot , “ Where are the men who came to spend the night with you ? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them ! ”
1:19:006:0	So Lot stepped outside to talk to them , shutting the door behind him .
1:19:007:0	“ Please , my brothers , ” he begged , “ do n't do such a wicked thing .
1:19:008:0	Look , I have two virgin daughters . Let me bring them out to you , and you can do with them as you wish . But please , leave these men alone , for they are my guests and are under my protection . ”
1:19:009:0	“ Stand back ! ” they shouted . “ This fellow came to town as an outsider , and now he 's acting like our judge ! We 'll treat you far worse than those other men ! ” And they lunged toward Lot to break down the door .
1:19:010:0	But the two angels reached out , pulled Lot into the house , and bolted the door .
1:19:011:0	Then they blinded all the men , young and old , who were at the door of the house , so they gave up trying to get inside .
1:19:012:0	Meanwhile , the angels questioned Lot . “ Do you have any other relatives here in the city ? ” they asked . “ Get them out of this place — your sons-in-law , sons , daughters , or anyone else .
1:19:013:0	For we are about to destroy this city completely . The outcry against this place is so great it has reached the Lord , and he has sent us to destroy it . ”
1:19:014:0	So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters ' fiancés , “ Quick , get out of the city ! The Lord is about to destroy it. ” But the young men thought he was only joking .
1:19:015:0	At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent . “ Hurry , ” they said to Lot . “ Take your wife and your two daughters who are here . Get out right now , or you will be swept away in the destruction of the city ! ”
1:19:016:0	When Lot still hesitated , the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city , for the Lord was merciful .
1:19:017:0	When they were safely out of the city , one of the angels ordered , “ Run for your lives ! And do n't look back or stop anywhere in the valley ! Escape to the mountains , or you will be swept away ! ”
1:19:018:0	“ Oh no , my lord ! ” Lot begged .
1:19:019:0	“ You have been so gracious to me and saved my life , and you have shown such great kindness . But I can not go to the mountains . Disaster would catch up to me there , and I would soon die .
1:19:020:0	See , there is a small village nearby . Please let me go there instead ; do n't you see how small it is ? Then my life will be saved . ”
1:19:021:0	“ All right , ” the angel said , “ I will grant your request . I will not destroy the little village .
1:19:022:0	But hurry ! Escape to it , for I can do nothing until you arrive there. ” ( This explains why that village was known as Zoar , which means “ little place . ” )
1:19:023:0	Lot reached the village just as the sun was rising over the horizon .
1:19:024:0	Then the Lord rained down fire and burning sulfur from the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah .
1:19:025:0	He utterly destroyed them , along with the other cities and villages of the plain , wiping out all the people and every bit of vegetation .
1:19:026:0	But Lot 's wife looked back as she was following behind him , and she turned into a pillar of salt .
1:19:027:0	Abraham got up early that morning and hurried out to the place where he had stood in the Lord 's presence .
1:19:028:0	He looked out across the plain toward Sodom and Gomorrah and watched as columns of smoke rose from the cities like smoke from a furnace .
1:19:002:1	Lot and His Daughters
1:19:029:0	But God had listened to Abraham 's request and kept Lot safe , removing him from the disaster that engulfed the cities on the plain .
1:19:030:0	Afterward Lot left Zoar because he was afraid of the people there , and he went to live in a cave in the mountains with his two daughters .
1:19:031:0	One day the older daughter said to her sister , “ There are no men left anywhere in this entire area , so we ca n't get married like everyone else . And our father will soon be too old to have children .
1:19:032:0	Come , let 's get him drunk with wine , and then we will have sex with him . That way we will preserve our family line through our father . ”
1:19:033:0	So that night they got him drunk with wine , and the older daughter went in and had intercourse with her father . He was unaware of her lying down or getting up again .
1:19:034:0	The next morning the older daughter said to her younger sister , “ I had sex with our father last night . Let 's get him drunk with wine again tonight , and you go in and have sex with him . That way we will preserve our family line through our father . ”
1:19:035:0	So that night they got him drunk with wine again , and the younger daughter went in and had intercourse with him . As before , he was unaware of her lying down or getting up again .
1:19:036:0	As a result , both of Lot 's daughters became pregnant by their own father .
1:19:037:0	When the older daughter gave birth to a son , she named him Moab . He became the ancestor of the nation now known as the Moabites .
1:19:038:0	When the younger daughter gave birth to a son , she named him Ben-ammi . He became the ancestor of the nation now known as the Ammonites .
