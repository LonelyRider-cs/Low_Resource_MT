1:49:001:1	Jacob 's Last Words to His Sons
1:49:001:0	Then Jacob called together all his sons and said , “ Gather around me , and I will tell you what will happen to each of you in the days to come .
1:49:002:0	“ Come and listen , you sons of Jacob ; listen to Israel , your father .
1:49:003:0	“ Reuben , you are my firstborn , my strength , the child of my vigorous youth.You are first in rank and first in power .
1:49:004:0	But you are as unruly as a flood , and you will be first no longer.For you went to bed with my wife ; you defiled my marriage couch .
1:49:005:0	“ Simeon and Levi are two of a kind ; their weapons are instruments of violence .
1:49:006:0	May I never join in their meetings ; may I never be a party to their plans.For in their anger they murdered men , and they crippled oxen just for sport .
1:49:007:0	A curse on their anger , for it is fierce ; a curse on their wrath , for it is cruel.I will scatter them among the descendants of Jacob ; I will disperse them throughout Israel .
1:49:008:0	“ Judah , your brothers will praise you.You will grasp your enemies by the neck.All your relatives will bow before you .
1:49:009:0	Judah , my son , is a young lionthat has finished eating its prey.Like a lion he crouches and lies down ; like a lioness — who dares to rouse him ?
1:49:010:0	The scepter will not depart from Judah , nor the ruler 's staff from his descendants , until the coming of the one to whom it belongs , the one whom all nations will honor .
1:49:011:0	He ties his foal to a grapevine , the colt of his donkey to a choice vine.He washes his clothes in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
1:49:012:0	His eyes are darker than wine , and his teeth are whiter than milk .
1:49:013:0	“ Zebulun will settle by the seashoreand will be a harbor for ships ; his borders will extend to Sidon .
1:49:014:0	“ Issachar is a sturdy donkey , resting between two saddlepacks .
1:49:015:0	When he sees how good the countryside isand how pleasant the land , he will bend his shoulder to the loadand submit himself to hard labor .
1:49:016:0	“ Dan will govern his people , like any other tribe in Israel .
1:49:017:0	Dan will be a snake beside the road , a poisonous viper along the paththat bites the horse 's hoovesso its rider is thrown off .
1:49:018:0	I trust in you for salvation , O Lord !
1:49:019:0	“ Gad will be attacked by marauding bands , but he will attack them when they retreat .
1:49:020:0	“ Asher will dine on rich foodsand produce food fit for kings .
1:49:021:0	“ Naphtali is a doe set freethat bears beautiful fawns .
1:49:022:0	“ Joseph is the foal of a wild donkey , the foal of a wild donkey at a spring — one of the wild donkeys on the ridge .
1:49:023:0	Archers attacked him savagely ; they shot at him and harassed him .
1:49:024:0	But his bow remained taut , and his arms were strengthenedby the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob , by the Shepherd , the Rock of Israel .
1:49:025:0	May the God of your father help you ; may the Almighty bless youwith the blessings of the heavens above , and blessings of the watery depths below , and blessings of the breasts and womb .
1:49:026:0	May my fatherly blessings on yousurpass the blessings of my ancestors , reaching to the heights of the eternal hills.May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph , who is a prince among his brothers .
1:49:027:0	“ Benjamin is a ravenous wolf , devouring his enemies in the morningand dividing his plunder in the evening . ”
1:49:002:1	Jacob 's Death and Burial
1:49:028:0	These are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father said as he told his sons good-bye . He blessed each one with an appropriate message .
1:49:029:0	Then Jacob instructed them , “ Soon I will die and join my ancestors . Bury me with my father and grandfather in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite .
1:49:030:0	This is the cave in the field of Machpelah , near Mamre in Canaan , that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a permanent burial site .
1:49:031:0	There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried . There Isaac and his wife , Rebekah , are buried . And there I buried Leah .
1:49:032:0	It is the plot of land and the cave that my grandfather Abraham bought from the Hittites . ”
1:49:033:0	When Jacob had finished this charge to his sons , he drew his feet into the bed , breathed his last , and joined his ancestors in death .
