1:48:001:1	Jacob Blesses Manasseh and Ephraim
1:48:001:0	One day not long after this , word came to Joseph , “ Your father is failing rapidly. ” So Joseph went to visit his father , and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
1:48:002:0	When Joseph arrived , Jacob was told , “ Your son Joseph has come to see you. ” So Jacob gathered his strength and sat up in his bed .
1:48:003:0	Jacob said to Joseph , “ God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me .
1:48:004:0	He said to me , ‘ I will make you fruitful , and I will multiply your descendants . I will make you a multitude of nations . And I will give this land of Canaan to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession . '
1:48:005:0	“ Now I am claiming as my own sons these two boys of yours , Ephraim and Manasseh , who were born here in the land of Egypt before I arrived . They will be my sons , just as Reuben and Simeon are .
1:48:006:0	But any children born to you in the future will be your own , and they will inherit land within the territories of their brothers Ephraim and Manasseh .
1:48:007:0	“ Long ago , as I was returning from Paddan-aram , Rachel died in the land of Canaan . We were still on the way , some distance from Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) . So with great sorrow I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath . ”
1:48:008:0	Then Jacob looked over at the two boys . “ Are these your sons ? ” he asked .
1:48:009:0	“ Yes , ” Joseph told him , “ these are the sons God has given me here in Egypt. ” And Jacob said , “ Bring them closer to me , so I can bless them . ”
1:48:010:0	Jacob was half blind because of his age and could hardly see . So Joseph brought the boys close to him , and Jacob kissed and embraced them .
1:48:011:0	Then Jacob said to Joseph , “ I never thought I would see your face again , but now God has let me see your children , too ! ”
1:48:012:0	Joseph moved the boys , who were at their grandfather 's knees , and he bowed with his face to the ground .
1:48:013:0	Then he positioned the boys in front of Jacob . With his right hand he directed Ephraim toward Jacob 's left hand , and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Jacob 's right hand .
1:48:014:0	But Jacob crossed his arms as he reached out to lay his hands on the boys ' heads . He put his right hand on the head of Ephraim , though he was the younger boy , and his left hand on the head of Manasseh , though he was the firstborn .
1:48:015:0	Then he blessed Joseph and said , “ May the God before whom my grandfather Abrahamand my father , Isaac , walked — the God who has been my shepherdall my life , to this very day ,
1:48:016:0	the Angel who has redeemed me from all harm — may he bless these boys.May they preserve my nameand the names of Abraham and Isaac.And may their descendants multiply greatlythroughout the earth . ”
1:48:017:0	But Joseph was upset when he saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim 's head . So Joseph lifted it to move it from Ephraim 's head to Manasseh 's head .
1:48:018:0	“ No , my father , ” he said . “ This one is the firstborn . Put your right hand on his head . ”
1:48:019:0	But his father refused . “ I know , my son ; I know , ” he replied . “ Manasseh will also become a great people , but his younger brother will become even greater . And his descendants will become a multitude of nations . ”
1:48:020:0	So Jacob blessed the boys that day with this blessing : “ The people of Israel will use your names when they give a blessing . They will say , ‘ May God make you as prosperous as Ephraim and Manasseh . ' ” In this way , Jacob put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh .
1:48:021:0	Then Jacob said to Joseph , “ Look , I am about to die , but God will be with you and will take you back to Canaan , the land of your ancestors .
1:48:022:0	And beyond what I have given your brothers , I am giving you an extra portion of the land that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow . ”
