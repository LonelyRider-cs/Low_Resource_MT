1:39:001:1	Joseph in Potiphar 's House
1:39:001:0	When Joseph was taken to Egypt by the Ishmaelite traders , he was purchased by Potiphar , an Egyptian officer . Potiphar was captain of the guard for Pharaoh , the king of Egypt .
1:39:002:0	The Lord was with Joseph , so he succeeded in everything he did as he served in the home of his Egyptian master .
1:39:003:0	Potiphar noticed this and realized that the Lord was with Joseph , giving him success in everything he did .
1:39:004:0	This pleased Potiphar , so he soon made Joseph his personal attendant . He put him in charge of his entire household and everything he owned .
1:39:005:0	From the day Joseph was put in charge of his master 's household and property , the Lord began to bless Potiphar 's household for Joseph 's sake . All his household affairs ran smoothly , and his crops and livestock flourished .
1:39:006:0	So Potiphar gave Joseph complete administrative responsibility over everything he owned . With Joseph there , he did n't worry about a thing—except what kind of food to eat ! Joseph was a very handsome and well-built young man ,
1:39:007:0	and Potiphar 's wife soon began to look at him lustfully . “ Come and sleep with me , ” she demanded .
1:39:008:0	But Joseph refused . “ Look , ” he told her , “ my master trusts me with everything in his entire household .
1:39:009:0	No one here has more authority than I do . He has held back nothing from me except you , because you are his wife . How could I do such a wicked thing ? It would be a great sin against God . ”
1:39:010:0	She kept putting pressure on Joseph day after day , but he refused to sleep with her , and he kept out of her way as much as possible .
1:39:011:0	One day , however , no one else was around when he went in to do his work .
1:39:012:0	She came and grabbed him by his cloak , demanding , “ Come on , sleep with me ! ” Joseph tore himself away , but he left his cloak in her hand as he ran from the house .
1:39:013:0	When she saw that she was holding his cloak and he had fled ,
1:39:014:0	she called out to her servants . Soon all the men came running . “ Look ! ” she said . “ My husband has brought this Hebrew slave here to make fools of us ! He came into my room to rape me , but I screamed .
1:39:015:0	When he heard me scream , he ran outside and got away , but he left his cloak behind with me . ”
1:39:016:0	She kept the cloak with her until her husband came home .
1:39:017:0	Then she told him her story . “ That Hebrew slave you 've brought into our house tried to come in and fool around with me , ” she said .
1:39:002:1	Joseph Put in Prison
1:39:018:0	“ But when I screamed , he ran outside , leaving his cloak with me ! ”
1:39:019:0	Potiphar was furious when he heard his wife 's story about how Joseph had treated her .
1:39:020:0	So he took Joseph and threw him into the prison where the king 's prisoners were held , and there he remained .
1:39:021:0	But the Lord was with Joseph in the prison and showed him his faithful love . And the Lord made Joseph a favorite with the prison warden .
1:39:022:0	Before long , the warden put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and over everything that happened in the prison .
1:39:023:0	The warden had no more worries , because Joseph took care of everything . The Lord was with him and caused everything he did to succeed .
