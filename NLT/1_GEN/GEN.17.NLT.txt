1:17:001:1	Abram Is Named Abraham
1:17:001:0	When Abram was ninety-nine years old , the Lord appeared to him and said , “ I am El-Shaddai — ‘ God Almighty . ' Serve me faithfully and live a blameless life .
1:17:002:0	I will make a covenant with you , by which I will guarantee to give you countless descendants . ”
1:17:003:0	At this , Abram fell face down on the ground . Then God said to him ,
1:17:004:0	“ This is my covenant with you : I will make you the father of a multitude of nations !
1:17:005:0	What 's more , I am changing your name . It will no longer be Abram . Instead , you will be called Abraham , for you will be the father of many nations .
1:17:006:0	I will make you extremely fruitful . Your descendants will become many nations , and kings will be among them !
1:17:007:0	“ I will confirm my covenant with you and your descendants after you , from generation to generation . This is the everlasting covenant : I will always be your God and the God of your descendants after you .
1:17:002:1	The Mark of the Covenant
1:17:008:0	And I will give the entire land of Canaan , where you now live as a foreigner , to you and your descendants . It will be their possession forever , and I will be their God . ”
1:17:009:0	Then God said to Abraham , “ Your responsibility is to obey the terms of the covenant . You and all your descendants have this continual responsibility .
1:17:010:0	This is the covenant that you and your descendants must keep : Each male among you must be circumcised .
1:17:011:0	You must cut off the flesh of your foreskin as a sign of the covenant between me and you .
1:17:012:0	From generation to generation , every male child must be circumcised on the eighth day after his birth . This applies not only to members of your family but also to the servants born in your household and the foreign-born servants whom you have purchased .
1:17:013:0	All must be circumcised . Your bodies will bear the mark of my everlasting covenant .
1:17:003:1	Sarai Is Named Sarah
1:17:014:0	Any male who fails to be circumcised will be cut off from the covenant family for breaking the covenant . ”
1:17:015:0	Then God said to Abraham , “ Regarding Sarai , your wife — her name will no longer be Sarai . From now on her name will be Sarah .
1:17:016:0	And I will bless her and give you a son from her ! Yes , I will bless her richly , and she will become the mother of many nations . Kings of nations will be among her descendants . ”
1:17:017:0	Then Abraham bowed down to the ground , but he laughed to himself in disbelief . “ How could I become a father at the age of 100 ? ” he thought . “ And how can Sarah have a baby when she is ninety years old ? ”
1:17:018:0	So Abraham said to God , “ May Ishmael live under your special blessing ! ”
1:17:019:0	But God replied , “ No — Sarah , your wife , will give birth to a son for you . You will name him Isaac , and I will confirm my covenant with him and his descendants as an everlasting covenant .
1:17:020:0	As for Ishmael , I will bless him also , just as you have asked . I will make him extremely fruitful and multiply his descendants . He will become the father of twelve princes , and I will make him a great nation .
1:17:021:0	But my covenant will be confirmed with Isaac , who will be born to you and Sarah about this time next year . ”
1:17:022:0	When God had finished speaking , he left Abraham .
1:17:023:0	On that very day Abraham took his son , Ishmael , and every male in his household , including those born there and those he had bought . Then he circumcised them , cutting off their foreskins , just as God had told him .
1:17:024:0	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised ,
1:17:025:0	and Ishmael , his son , was thirteen .
1:17:026:0	Both Abraham and his son , Ishmael , were circumcised on that same day ,
1:17:027:0	along with all the other men and boys of the household , whether they were born there or bought as servants . All were circumcised with him .
