1:15:001:1	The
1:15:002:1	Lord
1:15:003:1	's Covenant Promise to Abram
1:15:001:0	Some time later , the Lord spoke to Abram in a vision and said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Abram , for I will protect you , and your reward will be great . ”
1:15:002:0	But Abram replied , “ O Sovereign Lord , what good are all your blessings when I do n't even have a son ? Since you 've given me no children , Eliezer of Damascus , a servant in my household , will inherit all my wealth .
1:15:003:0	You have given me no descendants of my own , so one of my servants will be my heir . ”
1:15:004:0	Then the Lord said to him , “ No , your servant will not be your heir , for you will have a son of your own who will be your heir . ”
1:15:005:0	Then the Lord took Abram outside and said to him , “ Look up into the sky and count the stars if you can . That 's how many descendants you will have ! ”
1:15:006:0	And Abram believed the Lord , and the Lord counted him as righteous because of his faith .
1:15:007:0	Then the Lord told him , “ I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as your possession . ”
1:15:008:0	But Abram replied , “ O Sovereign Lord , how can I be sure that I will actually possess it ? ”
1:15:009:0	The Lord told him , “ Bring me a three-year-old heifer , a three-year-old female goat , a three-year-old ram , a turtledove , and a young pigeon . ”
1:15:010:0	So Abram presented all these to him and killed them . Then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the halves side by side ; he did not , however , cut the birds in half .
1:15:011:0	Some vultures swooped down to eat the carcasses , but Abram chased them away .
1:15:012:0	As the sun was going down , Abram fell into a deep sleep , and a terrifying darkness came down over him .
1:15:013:0	Then the Lord said to Abram , “ You can be sure that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign land , where they will be oppressed as slaves for 400 years .
1:15:014:0	But I will punish the nation that enslaves them , and in the end they will come away with great wealth .
1:15:015:0	( As for you , you will die in peace and be buried at a ripe old age . )
1:15:016:0	After four generations your descendants will return here to this land , for the sins of the Amorites do not yet warrant their destruction . ”
1:15:017:0	After the sun went down and darkness fell , Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch pass between the halves of the carcasses .
1:15:018:0	So the Lord made a covenant with Abram that day and said , “ I have given this land to your descendants , all the way from the border of Egypt to the great Euphrates River—
1:15:019:0	the land now occupied by the Kenites , Kenizzites , Kadmonites ,
1:15:020:0	Hittites , Perizzites , Rephaites ,
1:15:021:0	Amorites , Canaanites , Girgashites , and Jebusites . ”
