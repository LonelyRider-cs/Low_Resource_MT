1:26:001:1	Isaac Deceives Abimelech
1:26:001:0	A severe famine now struck the land , as had happened before in Abraham 's time . So Isaac moved to Gerar , where Abimelech , king of the Philistines , lived .
1:26:002:0	The Lord appeared to Isaac and said , “ Do not go down to Egypt , but do as I tell you .
1:26:003:0	Live here as a foreigner in this land , and I will be with you and bless you . I hereby confirm that I will give all these lands to you and your descendants , just as I solemnly promised Abraham , your father .
1:26:004:0	I will cause your descendants to become as numerous as the stars of the sky , and I will give them all these lands . And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed .
1:26:005:0	I will do this because Abraham listened to me and obeyed all my requirements , commands , decrees , and instructions . ”
1:26:006:0	So Isaac stayed in Gerar .
1:26:007:0	When the men who lived there asked Isaac about his wife , Rebekah , he said , “ She is my sister. ” He was afraid to say , “ She is my wife. ” He thought , “ They will kill me to get her , because she is so beautiful . ”
1:26:008:0	But some time later , Abimelech , king of the Philistines , looked out his window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah .
1:26:009:0	Immediately , Abimelech called for Isaac and exclaimed , “ She is obviously your wife ! Why did you say , ‘ She is my sister ' ? ” “ Because I was afraid someone would kill me to get her from me , ” Isaac replied .
1:26:010:0	“ How could you do this to us ? ” Abimelech exclaimed . “ One of my people might easily have taken your wife and slept with her , and you would have made us guilty of great sin . ”
1:26:002:1	Conflict over Water Rights
1:26:011:0	Then Abimelech issued a public proclamation : “ Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death ! ”
1:26:012:0	When Isaac planted his crops that year , he harvested a hundred times more grain than he planted , for the Lord blessed him .
1:26:013:0	He became a very rich man , and his wealth continued to grow .
1:26:014:0	He acquired so many flocks of sheep and goats , herds of cattle , and servants that the Philistines became jealous of him .
1:26:015:0	So the Philistines filled up all of Isaac 's wells with dirt . These were the wells that had been dug by the servants of his father , Abraham .
1:26:016:0	Finally , Abimelech ordered Isaac to leave the country . “ Go somewhere else , ” he said , “ for you have become too powerful for us . ”
1:26:017:0	So Isaac moved away to the Gerar Valley , where he set up their tents and settled down .
1:26:018:0	He reopened the wells his father had dug , which the Philistines had filled in after Abraham 's death . Isaac also restored the names Abraham had given them .
1:26:019:0	Isaac 's servants also dug in the Gerar Valley and discovered a well of fresh water .
1:26:020:0	But then the shepherds from Gerar came and claimed the spring . “ This is our water , ” they said , and they argued over it with Isaac 's herdsmen . So Isaac named the well Esek ( which means “ argument ” ) .
1:26:021:0	Isaac 's men then dug another well , but again there was a dispute over it . So Isaac named it Sitnah ( which means “ hostility ” ) .
1:26:022:0	Abandoning that one , Isaac moved on and dug another well . This time there was no dispute over it , so Isaac named the place Rehoboth ( which means “ open space ” ) , for he said , “ At last the Lord has created enough space for us to prosper in this land . ”
1:26:023:0	From there Isaac moved to Beersheba ,
1:26:024:0	where the Lord appeared to him on the night of his arrival . “ I am the God of your father , Abraham , ” he said . “ Do not be afraid , for I am with you and will bless you . I will multiply your descendants , and they will become a great nation . I will do this because of my promise to Abraham , my servant . ”
1:26:003:1	Isaac 's Covenant with Abimelech
1:26:025:0	Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the Lord . He set up his camp at that place , and his servants dug another well .
1:26:026:0	One day King Abimelech came from Gerar with his adviser , Ahuzzath , and also Phicol , his army commander .
1:26:027:0	“ Why have you come here ? ” Isaac asked . “ You obviously hate me , since you kicked me off your land . ”
1:26:028:0	They replied , “ We can plainly see that the Lord is with you . So we want to enter into a sworn treaty with you . Let 's make a covenant .
1:26:029:0	Swear that you will not harm us , just as we have never troubled you . We have always treated you well , and we sent you away from us in peace . And now look how the Lord has blessed you ! ”
1:26:030:0	So Isaac prepared a covenant feast to celebrate the treaty , and they ate and drank together .
1:26:031:0	Early the next morning , they each took a solemn oath not to interfere with each other . Then Isaac sent them home again , and they left him in peace .
1:26:032:0	That very day Isaac 's servants came and told him about a new well they had dug . “ We 've found water ! ” they exclaimed .
1:26:033:0	So Isaac named the well Shibah ( which means “ oath ” ) . And to this day the town that grew up there is called Beersheba ( which means “ well of the oath ” ) .
1:26:034:0	At the age of forty , Esau married two Hittite wives : Judith , the daughter of Beeri , and Basemath , the daughter of Elon .
1:26:035:0	But Esau 's wives made life miserable for Isaac and Rebekah .
