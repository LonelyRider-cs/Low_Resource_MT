1:25:001:1	The Death of Abraham
1:25:001:0	Abraham married another wife , whose name was Keturah .
1:25:002:0	She gave birth to Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak , and Shuah .
1:25:003:0	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan . Dedan 's descendants were the Asshurites , Letushites , and Leummites .
1:25:004:0	Midian 's sons were Ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . These were all descendants of Abraham through Keturah .
1:25:005:0	Abraham gave everything he owned to his son Isaac .
1:25:006:0	But before he died , he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to a land in the east , away from Isaac .
1:25:007:0	Abraham lived for 175 years ,
1:25:008:0	and he died at a ripe old age , having lived a long and satisfying life . He breathed his last and joined his ancestors in death .
1:25:009:0	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , near Mamre , in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite .
1:25:010:0	This was the field Abraham had purchased from the Hittites and where he had buried his wife Sarah .
1:25:002:1	Ishmael 's Descendants
1:25:011:0	After Abraham 's death , God blessed his son Isaac , who settled near Beer-lahai-roi in the Negev .
1:25:012:0	This is the account of the family of Ishmael , the son of Abraham through Hagar , Sarah 's Egyptian servant .
1:25:013:0	Here is a list , by their names and clans , of Ishmael 's descendants : The oldest was Nebaioth , followed by Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
1:25:014:0	Mishma , Dumah , Massa ,
1:25:015:0	Hadad , Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah .
1:25:016:0	These twelve sons of Ishmael became the founders of twelve tribes named after them , listed according to the places they settled and camped .
1:25:017:0	Ishmael lived for 137 years . Then he breathed his last and joined his ancestors in death .
1:25:003:1	The Births of Esau and Jacob
1:25:018:0	Ishmael 's descendants occupied the region from Havilah to Shur , which is east of Egypt in the direction of Asshur . There they lived in open hostility toward all their relatives .
1:25:019:0	This is the account of the family of Isaac , the son of Abraham .
1:25:020:0	When Isaac was forty years old , he married Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean .
1:25:021:0	Isaac pleaded with the Lord on behalf of his wife , because she was unable to have children . The Lord answered Isaac 's prayer , and Rebekah became pregnant with twins .
1:25:022:0	But the two children struggled with each other in her womb . So she went to ask the Lord about it . “ Why is this happening to me ? ” she asked .
1:25:023:0	And the Lord told her , “ The sons in your womb will become two nations . From the very beginning , the two nations will be rivals . One nation will be stronger than the other ; and your older son will serve your younger son . ”
1:25:024:0	And when the time came to give birth , Rebekah discovered that she did indeed have twins !
1:25:025:0	The first one was very red at birth and covered with thick hair like a fur coat . So they named him Esau .
1:25:004:1	Esau Sells His Birthright
1:25:026:0	Then the other twin was born with his hand grasping Esau 's heel . So they named him Jacob . Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born .
1:25:027:0	As the boys grew up , Esau became a skillful hunter . He was an outdoorsman , but Jacob had a quiet temperament , preferring to stay at home .
1:25:028:0	Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating the wild game Esau brought home , but Rebekah loved Jacob .
1:25:029:0	One day when Jacob was cooking some stew , Esau arrived home from the wilderness exhausted and hungry .
1:25:030:0	Esau said to Jacob , “ I 'm starved ! Give me some of that red stew ! ” ( This is how Esau got his other name , Edom , which means “ red . ” )
1:25:031:0	“ All right , ” Jacob replied , “ but trade me your rights as the firstborn son . ”
1:25:032:0	“ Look , I 'm dying of starvation ! ” said Esau . “ What good is my birthright to me now ? ”
1:25:033:0	But Jacob said , “ First you must swear that your birthright is mine. ” So Esau swore an oath , thereby selling all his rights as the firstborn to his brother , Jacob .
1:25:034:0	Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew . Esau ate the meal , then got up and left . He showed contempt for his rights as the firstborn .
