1:13:001:1	Abram and Lot Separate
1:13:001:0	So Abram left Egypt and traveled north into the Negev , along with his wife and Lot and all that they owned .
1:13:002:0	( Abram was very rich in livestock , silver , and gold . )
1:13:003:0	From the Negev , they continued traveling by stages toward Bethel , and they pitched their tents between Bethel and Ai , where they had camped before .
1:13:004:0	This was the same place where Abram had built the altar , and there he worshiped the Lord again .
1:13:005:0	Lot , who was traveling with Abram , had also become very wealthy with flocks of sheep and goats , herds of cattle , and many tents .
1:13:006:0	But the land could not support both Abram and Lot with all their flocks and herds living so close together .
1:13:007:0	So disputes broke out between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot . ( At that time Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land . )
1:13:008:0	Finally Abram said to Lot , “ Let 's not allow this conflict to come between us or our herdsmen . After all , we are close relatives !
1:13:009:0	The whole countryside is open to you . Take your choice of any section of the land you want , and we will separate . If you want the land to the left , then I 'll take the land on the right . If you prefer the land on the right , then I 'll go to the left . ”
1:13:010:0	Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan Valley in the direction of Zoar . The whole area was well watered everywhere , like the garden of the Lord or the beautiful land of Egypt . ( This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah . )
1:13:011:0	Lot chose for himself the whole Jordan Valley to the east of them . He went there with his flocks and servants and parted company with his uncle Abram .
1:13:012:0	So Abram settled in the land of Canaan , and Lot moved his tents to a place near Sodom and settled among the cities of the plain .
1:13:013:0	But the people of this area were extremely wicked and constantly sinned against the Lord .
1:13:014:0	After Lot had gone , the Lord said to Abram , “ Look as far as you can see in every direction — north and south , east and west .
1:13:015:0	I am giving all this land , as far as you can see , to you and your descendants as a permanent possession .
1:13:016:0	And I will give you so many descendants that , like the dust of the earth , they can not be counted !
1:13:017:0	Go and walk through the land in every direction , for I am giving it to you . ”
1:13:018:0	So Abram moved his camp to Hebron and settled near the oak grove belonging to Mamre . There he built another altar to the Lord .
