1:34:001:1	Revenge against Shechem
1:34:001:0	One day Dinah , the daughter of Jacob and Leah , went to visit some of the young women who lived in the area .
1:34:002:0	But when the local prince , Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite , saw Dinah , he seized her and raped her .
1:34:003:0	But then he fell in love with her , and he tried to win her affection with tender words .
1:34:004:0	He said to his father , Hamor , “ Get me this young girl . I want to marry her . ”
1:34:005:0	Soon Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter , Dinah . But since his sons were out in the fields herding his livestock , he said nothing until they returned .
1:34:006:0	Hamor , Shechem 's father , came to discuss the matter with Jacob .
1:34:007:0	Meanwhile , Jacob 's sons had come in from the field as soon as they heard what had happened . They were shocked and furious that their sister had been raped . Shechem had done a disgraceful thing against Jacob 's family , something that should never be done .
1:34:008:0	Hamor tried to speak with Jacob and his sons . “ My son Shechem is truly in love with your daughter , ” he said . “ Please let him marry her .
1:34:009:0	In fact , let 's arrange other marriages , too . You give us your daughters for our sons , and we will give you our daughters for your sons .
1:34:010:0	And you may live among us ; the land is open to you ! Settle here and trade with us . And feel free to buy property in the area . ”
1:34:011:0	Then Shechem himself spoke to Dinah 's father and brothers . “ Please be kind to me , and let me marry her , ” he begged . “ I will give you whatever you ask .
1:34:012:0	No matter what dowry or gift you demand , I will gladly pay it — just give me the girl as my wife . ”
1:34:013:0	But since Shechem had defiled their sister , Dinah , Jacob 's sons responded deceitfully to Shechem and his father , Hamor .
1:34:014:0	They said to them , “ We could n't possibly allow this , because you 're not circumcised . It would be a disgrace for our sister to marry a man like you !
1:34:015:0	But here is a solution . If every man among you will be circumcised like we are ,
1:34:016:0	then we will give you our daughters , and we 'll take your daughters for ourselves . We will live among you and become one people .
1:34:017:0	But if you do n't agree to be circumcised , we will take her and be on our way . ”
1:34:018:0	Hamor and his son Shechem agreed to their proposal .
1:34:019:0	Shechem wasted no time in acting on this request , for he wanted Jacob 's daughter desperately . Shechem was a highly respected member of his family ,
1:34:020:0	and he went with his father , Hamor , to present this proposal to the leaders at the town gate .
1:34:021:0	“ These men are our friends , ” they said . “ Let 's invite them to live here among us and trade freely . Look , the land is large enough to hold them . We can take their daughters as wives and let them marry ours .
1:34:022:0	But they will consider staying here and becoming one people with us only if all of our men are circumcised , just as they are .
1:34:023:0	But if we do this , all their livestock and possessions will eventually be ours . Come , let 's agree to their terms and let them settle here among us . ”
1:34:024:0	So all the men in the town council agreed with Hamor and Shechem , and every male in the town was circumcised .
1:34:025:0	But three days later , when their wounds were still sore , two of Jacob 's sons , Simeon and Levi , who were Dinah 's full brothers , took their swords and entered the town without opposition . Then they slaughtered every male there ,
1:34:026:0	including Hamor and his son Shechem . They killed them with their swords , then took Dinah from Shechem 's house and returned to their camp .
1:34:027:0	Meanwhile , the rest of Jacob 's sons arrived . Finding the men slaughtered , they plundered the town because their sister had been defiled there .
1:34:028:0	They seized all the flocks and herds and donkeys — everything they could lay their hands on , both inside the town and outside in the fields .
1:34:029:0	They looted all their wealth and plundered their houses . They also took all their little children and wives and led them away as captives .
1:34:030:0	Afterward Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ You have ruined me ! You 've made me stink among all the people of this land — among all the Canaanites and Perizzites . We are so few that they will join forces and crush us . I will be ruined , and my entire household will be wiped out ! ”
1:34:031:0	“ But why should we let him treat our sister like a prostitute ? ” they retorted angrily .
