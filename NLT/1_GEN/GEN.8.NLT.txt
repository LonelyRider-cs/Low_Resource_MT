1:8:001:1	The Flood Recedes
1:8:001:0	But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and livestock with him in the boat . He sent a wind to blow across the earth , and the floodwaters began to recede .
1:8:002:0	The underground waters stopped flowing , and the torrential rains from the sky were stopped .
1:8:003:0	So the floodwaters gradually receded from the earth . After 150 days ,
1:8:004:0	exactly five months from the time the flood began , the boat came to rest on the mountains of Ararat .
1:8:005:0	Two and a half months later , as the waters continued to go down , other mountain peaks became visible .
1:8:006:0	After another forty days , Noah opened the window he had made in the boat
1:8:007:0	and released a raven . The bird flew back and forth until the floodwaters on the earth had dried up .
1:8:008:0	He also released a dove to see if the water had receded and it could find dry ground .
1:8:009:0	But the dove could find no place to land because the water still covered the ground . So it returned to the boat , and Noah held out his hand and drew the dove back inside .
1:8:010:0	After waiting another seven days , Noah released the dove again .
1:8:011:0	This time the dove returned to him in the evening with a fresh olive leaf in its beak . Then Noah knew that the floodwaters were almost gone .
1:8:012:0	He waited another seven days and then released the dove again . This time it did not come back .
1:8:013:0	Noah was now 601 years old . On the first day of the new year , ten and a half months after the flood began , the floodwaters had almost dried up from the earth . Noah lifted back the covering of the boat and saw that the surface of the ground was drying .
1:8:014:0	Two more months went by , and at last the earth was dry !
1:8:015:0	Then God said to Noah ,
1:8:016:0	“ Leave the boat , all of you—you and your wife , and your sons and their wives .
1:8:017:0	Release all the animals—the birds , the livestock , and the small animals that scurry along the ground—so they can be fruitful and multiply throughout the earth . ”
1:8:018:0	So Noah , his wife , and his sons and their wives left the boat .
1:8:019:0	And all of the large and small animals and birds came out of the boat , pair by pair .
1:8:020:0	Then Noah built an altar to the Lord , and there he sacrificed as burnt offerings the animals and birds that had been approved for that purpose .
1:8:021:0	And the Lord was pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice and said to himself , “ I will never again curse the ground because of the human race , even though everything they think or imagine is bent toward evil from childhood . I will never again destroy all living things .
1:8:022:0	As long as the earth remains , there will be planting and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , day and night . ”
