1:24:001:1	A Wife for Isaac
1:24:001:0	Abraham was now a very old man , and the Lord had blessed him in every way .
1:24:002:0	One day Abraham said to his oldest servant , the man in charge of his household , “ Take an oath by putting your hand under my thigh .
1:24:003:0	Swear by the Lord , the God of heaven and earth , that you will not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women .
1:24:004:0	Go instead to my homeland , to my relatives , and find a wife there for my son Isaac . ”
1:24:005:0	The servant asked , “ But what if I ca n't find a young woman who is willing to travel so far from home ? Should I then take Isaac there to live among your relatives in the land you came from ? ”
1:24:006:0	“ No ! ” Abraham responded . “ Be careful never to take my son there .
1:24:007:0	For the Lord , the God of heaven , who took me from my father 's house and my native land , solemnly promised to give this land to my descendants . He will send his angel ahead of you , and he will see to it that you find a wife there for my son .
1:24:008:0	If she is unwilling to come back with you , then you are free from this oath of mine . But under no circumstances are you to take my son there . ”
1:24:009:0	So the servant took an oath by putting his hand under the thigh of his master , Abraham . He swore to follow Abraham 's instructions .
1:24:010:0	Then he loaded ten of Abraham 's camels with all kinds of expensive gifts from his master , and he traveled to distant Aram-naharaim . There he went to the town where Abraham 's brother Nahor had settled .
1:24:011:0	He made the camels kneel beside a well just outside the town . It was evening , and the women were coming out to draw water .
1:24:012:0	“ O Lord , God of my master , Abraham , ” he prayed . “ Please give me success today , and show unfailing love to my master , Abraham .
1:24:013:0	See , I am standing here beside this spring , and the young women of the town are coming out to draw water .
1:24:014:0	This is my request . I will ask one of them , ‘ Please give me a drink from your jug . ' If she says , ‘ Yes , have a drink , and I will water your camels , too ! ' — let her be the one you have selected as Isaac 's wife . This is how I will know that you have shown unfailing love to my master . ”
1:24:015:0	Before he had finished praying , he saw a young woman named Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder . She was the daughter of Bethuel , who was the son of Abraham 's brother Nahor and his wife , Milcah .
1:24:016:0	Rebekah was very beautiful and old enough to be married , but she was still a virgin . She went down to the spring , filled her jug , and came up again .
1:24:017:0	Running over to her , the servant said , “ Please give me a little drink of water from your jug . ”
1:24:018:0	“ Yes , my lord , ” she answered , “ have a drink. ” And she quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and gave him a drink .
1:24:019:0	When she had given him a drink , she said , “ I 'll draw water for your camels , too , until they have had enough to drink . ”
1:24:020:0	So she quickly emptied her jug into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw water for all his camels .
1:24:021:0	The servant watched her in silence , wondering whether or not the Lord had given him success in his mission .
1:24:022:0	Then at last , when the camels had finished drinking , he took out a gold ring for her nose and two large gold bracelets for her wrists .
1:24:023:0	“ Whose daughter are you ? ” he asked . “ And please tell me , would your father have any room to put us up for the night ? ”
1:24:024:0	“ I am the daughter of Bethuel , ” she replied . “ My grandparents are Nahor and Milcah .
1:24:025:0	Yes , we have plenty of straw and feed for the camels , and we have room for guests . ”
1:24:026:0	The man bowed low and worshiped the Lord .
1:24:027:0	“ Praise the Lord , the God of my master , Abraham , ” he said . “ The Lord has shown unfailing love and faithfulness to my master , for he has led me straight to my master 's relatives . ”
1:24:028:0	The young woman ran home to tell her family everything that had happened .
1:24:029:0	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban , who ran out to meet the man at the spring .
1:24:030:0	He had seen the nose-ring and the bracelets on his sister 's wrists , and had heard Rebekah tell what the man had said . So he rushed out to the spring , where the man was still standing beside his camels .
1:24:031:0	Laban said to him , “ Come and stay with us , you who are blessed by the Lord ! Why are you standing here outside the town when I have a room all ready for you and a place prepared for the camels ? ”
1:24:032:0	So the man went home with Laban , and Laban unloaded the camels , gave him straw for their bedding , fed them , and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet .
1:24:033:0	Then food was served . But Abraham 's servant said , “ I do n't want to eat until I have told you why I have come. ” “ All right , ” Laban said , “ tell us . ”
1:24:034:0	“ I am Abraham 's servant , ” he explained .
1:24:035:0	“ And the Lord has greatly blessed my master ; he has become a wealthy man . The Lord has given him flocks of sheep and goats , herds of cattle , a fortune in silver and gold , and many male and female servants and camels and donkeys .
1:24:036:0	“ When Sarah , my master 's wife , was very old , she gave birth to my master 's son , and my master has given him everything he owns .
1:24:037:0	And my master made me take an oath . He said , ‘ Do not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women .
1:24:038:0	Go instead to my father 's house , to my relatives , and find a wife there for my son . '
1:24:039:0	“ But I said to my master , ‘ What if I ca n't find a young woman who is willing to go back with me ? '
1:24:040:0	He responded , ‘ The Lord , in whose presence I have lived , will send his angel with you and will make your mission successful . Yes , you must find a wife for my son from among my relatives , from my father 's family .
1:24:041:0	Then you will have fulfilled your obligation . But if you go to my relatives and they refuse to let her go with you , you will be free from my oath . '
1:24:042:0	“ So today when I came to the spring , I prayed this prayer : ‘ O Lord , God of my master , Abraham , please give me success on this mission .
1:24:043:0	See , I am standing here beside this spring . This is my request . When a young woman comes to draw water , I will say to her , “ Please give me a little drink of water from your jug . ”
1:24:044:0	If she says , “ Yes , have a drink , and I will draw water for your camels , too , ” let her be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master 's son . '
1:24:045:0	“ Before I had finished praying in my heart , I saw Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder . She went down to the spring and drew water . So I said to her , ‘ Please give me a drink . '
1:24:046:0	She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said , ‘ Yes , have a drink , and I will water your camels , too ! ' So I drank , and then she watered the camels .
1:24:047:0	“ Then I asked , ‘ Whose daughter are you ? ' She replied , ‘ I am the daughter of Bethuel , and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah . ' So I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her wrists .
1:24:048:0	“ Then I bowed low and worshiped the Lord . I praised the Lord , the God of my master , Abraham , because he had led me straight to my master 's niece to be his son 's wife .
1:24:049:0	So tell me — will you or wo n't you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master ? Please tell me yes or no , and then I 'll know what to do next . ”
1:24:050:0	Then Laban and Bethuel replied , “ The Lord has obviously brought you here , so there is nothing we can say .
1:24:051:0	Here is Rebekah ; take her and go . Yes , let her be the wife of your master 's son , as the Lord has directed . ”
1:24:052:0	When Abraham 's servant heard their answer , he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the Lord .
1:24:053:0	Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah . He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother .
1:24:054:0	Then they ate their meal , and the servant and the men with him stayed there overnight.But early the next morning , Abraham 's servant said , “ Send me back to my master . ”
1:24:055:0	“ But we want Rebekah to stay with us at least ten days , ” her brother and mother said . “ Then she can go . ”
1:24:056:0	But he said , “ Do n't delay me . The Lord has made my mission successful ; now send me back so I can return to my master . ”
1:24:057:0	“ Well , ” they said , “ we 'll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks . ”
1:24:058:0	So they called Rebekah . “ Are you willing to go with this man ? ” they asked her.And she replied , “ Yes , I will go . ”
1:24:059:0	So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham 's servant and his men . The woman who had been Rebekah 's childhood nurse went along with her .
1:24:060:0	They gave her this blessing as she parted : “ Our sister , may you becomethe mother of many millions ! May your descendants be strongand conquer the cities of their enemies . ”
1:24:061:0	Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man . So Abraham 's servant took Rebekah and went on his way .
1:24:062:0	Meanwhile , Isaac , whose home was in the Negev , had returned from Beer-lahai-roi .
1:24:063:0	One evening as he was walking and meditating in the fields , he looked up and saw the camels coming .
1:24:064:0	When Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac , she quickly dismounted from her camel .
1:24:065:0	“ Who is that man walking through the fields to meet us ? ” she asked the servant.And he replied , “ It is my master. ” So Rebekah covered her face with her veil .
1:24:066:0	Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done .
1:24:067:0	And Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah 's tent , and she became his wife . He loved her deeply , and she was a special comfort to him after the death of his mother .
