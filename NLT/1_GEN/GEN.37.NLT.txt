1:37:001:1	Joseph 's Dreams
1:37:001:0	So Jacob settled again in the land of Canaan , where his father had lived as a foreigner .
1:37:002:0	This is the account of Jacob and his family . When Joseph was seventeen years old , he often tended his father 's flocks . He worked for his half brothers , the sons of his father 's wives Bilhah and Zilpah . But Joseph reported to his father some of the bad things his brothers were doing .
1:37:003:0	Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other children because Joseph had been born to him in his old age . So one day Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph—a beautiful robe .
1:37:004:0	But his brothers hated Joseph because their father loved him more than the rest of them . They could n't say a kind word to him .
1:37:005:0	One night Joseph had a dream , and when he told his brothers about it , they hated him more than ever .
1:37:006:0	“ Listen to this dream , ” he said .
1:37:007:0	“ We were out in the field , tying up bundles of grain . Suddenly my bundle stood up , and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before mine ! ”
1:37:008:0	His brothers responded , “ So you think you will be our king , do you ? Do you actually think you will reign over us ? ” And they hated him all the more because of his dreams and the way he talked about them .
1:37:009:0	Soon Joseph had another dream , and again he told his brothers about it . “ Listen , I have had another dream , ” he said . “ The sun , moon , and eleven stars bowed low before me ! ”
1:37:010:0	This time he told the dream to his father as well as to his brothers , but his father scolded him . “ What kind of dream is that ? ” he asked . “ Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow to the ground before you ? ”
1:37:011:0	But while his brothers were jealous of Joseph , his father wondered what the dreams meant .
1:37:012:0	Soon after this , Joseph 's brothers went to pasture their father 's flocks at Shechem .
1:37:013:0	When they had been gone for some time , Jacob said to Joseph , “ Your brothers are pasturing the sheep at Shechem . Get ready , and I will send you to them. ” “ I 'm ready to go , ” Joseph replied .
1:37:014:0	“ Go and see how your brothers and the flocks are getting along , ” Jacob said . “ Then come back and bring me a report. ” So Jacob sent him on his way , and Joseph traveled to Shechem from their home in the valley of Hebron .
1:37:015:0	When he arrived there , a man from the area noticed him wandering around the countryside . “ What are you looking for ? ” he asked .
1:37:016:0	“ I 'm looking for my brothers , ” Joseph replied . “ Do you know where they are pasturing their sheep ? ”
1:37:002:1	Joseph Sold into Slavery
1:37:017:0	“ Yes , ” the man told him . “ They have moved on from here , but I heard them say , ‘ Let 's go on to Dothan . ' ” So Joseph followed his brothers to Dothan and found them there .
1:37:018:0	When Joseph 's brothers saw him coming , they recognized him in the distance . As he approached , they made plans to kill him .
1:37:019:0	“ Here comes the dreamer ! ” they said .
1:37:020:0	“ Come on , let 's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns . We can tell our father , ‘ A wild animal has eaten him . ' Then we 'll see what becomes of his dreams ! ”
1:37:021:0	But when Reuben heard of their scheme , he came to Joseph 's rescue . “ Let 's not kill him , ” he said .
1:37:022:0	“ Why should we shed any blood ? Let 's just throw him into this empty cistern here in the wilderness . Then he 'll die without our laying a hand on him. ” Reuben was secretly planning to rescue Joseph and return him to his father .
1:37:023:0	So when Joseph arrived , his brothers ripped off the beautiful robe he was wearing .
1:37:024:0	Then they grabbed him and threw him into the cistern . Now the cistern was empty ; there was no water in it .
1:37:025:0	Then , just as they were sitting down to eat , they looked up and saw a caravan of camels in the distance coming toward them . It was a group of Ishmaelite traders taking a load of gum , balm , and aromatic resin from Gilead down to Egypt .
1:37:026:0	Judah said to his brothers , “ What will we gain by killing our brother ? We 'd have to cover up the crime .
1:37:027:0	Instead of hurting him , let 's sell him to those Ishmaelite traders . After all , he is our brother—our own flesh and blood ! ” And his brothers agreed .
1:37:028:0	So when the Ishmaelites , who were Midianite traders , came by , Joseph 's brothers pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to them for twenty pieces of silver . And the traders took him to Egypt .
1:37:029:0	Some time later , Reuben returned to get Joseph out of the cistern . When he discovered that Joseph was missing , he tore his clothes in grief .
1:37:030:0	Then he went back to his brothers and lamented , “ The boy is gone ! What will I do now ? ”
1:37:031:0	Then the brothers killed a young goat and dipped Joseph 's robe in its blood .
1:37:032:0	They sent the beautiful robe to their father with this message : “ Look at what we found . Does n't this robe belong to your son ? ”
1:37:033:0	Their father recognized it immediately . “ Yes , ” he said , “ it is my son 's robe . A wild animal must have eaten him . Joseph has clearly been torn to pieces ! ”
1:37:034:0	Then Jacob tore his clothes and dressed himself in burlap . He mourned deeply for his son for a long time .
1:37:035:0	His family all tried to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . “ I will go to my grave mourning for my son , ” he would say , and then he would weep .
1:37:036:0	Meanwhile , the Midianite traders arrived in Egypt , where they sold Joseph to Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . Potiphar was captain of the palace guard .
