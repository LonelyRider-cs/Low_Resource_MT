1:27:001:1	Jacob Steals Esau 's Blessing
1:27:001:0	One day when Isaac was old and turning blind , he called for Esau , his older son , and said , “ My son. ” “ Yes , Father ? ” Esau replied .
1:27:002:0	“ I am an old man now , ” Isaac said , “ and I do n't know when I may die .
1:27:003:0	Take your bow and a quiver full of arrows , and go out into the open country to hunt some wild game for me .
1:27:004:0	Prepare my favorite dish , and bring it here for me to eat . Then I will pronounce the blessing that belongs to you , my firstborn son , before I die . ”
1:27:005:0	But Rebekah overheard what Isaac had said to his son Esau . So when Esau left to hunt for the wild game ,
1:27:006:0	she said to her son Jacob , “ Listen . I overheard your father say to Esau ,
1:27:007:0	‘ Bring me some wild game and prepare me a delicious meal . Then I will bless you in the Lord 's presence before I die . '
1:27:008:0	Now , my son , listen to me . Do exactly as I tell you .
1:27:009:0	Go out to the flocks , and bring me two fine young goats . I 'll use them to prepare your father 's favorite dish .
1:27:010:0	Then take the food to your father so he can eat it and bless you before he dies . ”
1:27:011:0	“ But look , ” Jacob replied to Rebekah , “ my brother , Esau , is a hairy man , and my skin is smooth .
1:27:012:0	What if my father touches me ? He 'll see that I 'm trying to trick him , and then he 'll curse me instead of blessing me . ”
1:27:013:0	But his mother replied , “ Then let the curse fall on me , my son ! Just do what I tell you . Go out and get the goats for me ! ”
1:27:014:0	So Jacob went out and got the young goats for his mother . Rebekah took them and prepared a delicious meal , just the way Isaac liked it .
1:27:015:0	Then she took Esau 's favorite clothes , which were there in the house , and gave them to her younger son , Jacob .
1:27:016:0	She covered his arms and the smooth part of his neck with the skin of the young goats .
1:27:017:0	Then she gave Jacob the delicious meal , including freshly baked bread .
1:27:018:0	So Jacob took the food to his father . “ My father ? ” he said. “ Yes , my son , ” Isaac answered . “ Who are you — Esau or Jacob ? ”
1:27:019:0	Jacob replied , “ It 's Esau , your firstborn son . I 've done as you told me . Here is the wild game . Now sit up and eat it so you can give me your blessing . ”
1:27:020:0	Isaac asked , “ How did you find it so quickly , my son ? ” “ The Lord your God put it in my path ! ” Jacob replied .
1:27:021:0	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Come closer so I can touch you and make sure that you really are Esau . ”
1:27:022:0	So Jacob went closer to his father , and Isaac touched him . “ The voice is Jacob 's , but the hands are Esau 's , ” Isaac said .
1:27:023:0	But he did not recognize Jacob , because Jacob 's hands felt hairy just like Esau 's . So Isaac prepared to bless Jacob .
1:27:024:0	“ But are you really my son Esau ? ” he asked. “ Yes , I am , ” Jacob replied .
1:27:025:0	Then Isaac said , “ Now , my son , bring me the wild game . Let me eat it , and then I will give you my blessing. ” So Jacob took the food to his father , and Isaac ate it . He also drank the wine that Jacob served him .
1:27:026:0	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Please come a little closer and kiss me , my son . ”
1:27:027:0	So Jacob went over and kissed him . And when Isaac caught the smell of his clothes , he was finally convinced , and he blessed his son . He said , “ Ah ! The smell of my son is like the smell of the outdoors , which the Lord has blessed !
1:27:028:0	“ From the dew of heavenand the richness of the earth , may God always give you abundant harvests of grainand bountiful new wine .
1:27:029:0	May many nations become your servants , and may they bow down to you.May you be the master over your brothers , and may your mother 's sons bow down to you.All who curse you will be cursed , and all who bless you will be blessed . ”
1:27:030:0	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob , and almost before Jacob had left his father , Esau returned from his hunt .
1:27:031:0	Esau prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father . Then he said , “ Sit up , my father , and eat my wild game so you can give me your blessing . ”
1:27:032:0	But Isaac asked him , “ Who are you ? ” Esau replied , “ It 's your son , your firstborn son , Esau . ”
1:27:033:0	Isaac began to tremble uncontrollably and said , “ Then who just served me wild game ? I have already eaten it , and I blessed him just before you came . And yes , that blessing must stand ! ”
1:27:034:0	When Esau heard his father 's words , he let out a loud and bitter cry . “ Oh my father , what about me ? Bless me , too ! ” he begged .
1:27:035:0	But Isaac said , “ Your brother was here , and he tricked me . He has taken away your blessing . ”
1:27:036:0	Esau exclaimed , “ No wonder his name is Jacob , for now he has cheated me twice . First he took my rights as the firstborn , and now he has stolen my blessing . Oh , have n't you saved even one blessing for me ? ”
1:27:037:0	Isaac said to Esau , “ I have made Jacob your master and have declared that all his brothers will be his servants . I have guaranteed him an abundance of grain and wine — what is left for me to give you , my son ? ”
1:27:038:0	Esau pleaded , “ But do you have only one blessing ? Oh my father , bless me , too ! ” Then Esau broke down and wept .
1:27:039:0	Finally , his father , Isaac , said to him , “ You will live away from the richness of the earth , and away from the dew of the heaven above .
1:27:002:1	Jacob Flees to Paddan-Aram
1:27:040:0	You will live by your sword , and you will serve your brother.But when you decide to break free , you will shake his yoke from your neck . ”
1:27:041:0	From that time on , Esau hated Jacob because their father had given Jacob the blessing . And Esau began to scheme : “ I will soon be mourning my father 's death . Then I will kill my brother , Jacob . ”
1:27:042:0	But Rebekah heard about Esau 's plans . So she sent for Jacob and told him , “ Listen , Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you .
1:27:043:0	So listen carefully , my son . Get ready and flee to my brother , Laban , in Haran .
1:27:044:0	Stay there with him until your brother cools off .
1:27:045:0	When he calms down and forgets what you have done to him , I will send for you to come back . Why should I lose both of you in one day ? ”
1:27:046:0	Then Rebekah said to Isaac , “ I 'm sick and tired of these local Hittite women ! I would rather die than see Jacob marry one of them . ”
