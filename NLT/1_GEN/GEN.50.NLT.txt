1:50:001:0	Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him .
1:50:002:0	Then Joseph told the physicians who served him to embalm his father 's body ; so Jacob was embalmed .
1:50:003:0	The embalming process took the usual forty days . And the Egyptians mourned his death for seventy days .
1:50:004:0	When the period of mourning was over , Joseph approached Pharaoh 's advisers and said , “ Please do me this favor and speak to Pharaoh on my behalf .
1:50:005:0	Tell him that my father made me swear an oath . He said to me , ‘ Listen , I am about to die . Take my body back to the land of Canaan , and bury me in the tomb I prepared for myself . ' So please allow me to go and bury my father . After his burial , I will return without delay . ”
1:50:006:0	Pharaoh agreed to Joseph 's request . “ Go and bury your father , as he made you promise , ” he said .
1:50:007:0	So Joseph went up to bury his father . He was accompanied by all of Pharaoh 's officials , all the senior members of Pharaoh 's household , and all the senior officers of Egypt .
1:50:008:0	Joseph also took his entire household and his brothers and their households . But they left their little children and flocks and herds in the land of Goshen .
1:50:009:0	A great number of chariots and charioteers accompanied Joseph .
1:50:010:0	When they arrived at the threshing floor of Atad , near the Jordan River , they held a very great and solemn memorial service , with a seven-day period of mourning for Joseph 's father .
1:50:011:0	The local residents , the Canaanites , watched them mourning at the threshing floor of Atad . Then they renamed that place ( which is near the Jordan ) Abel-mizraim , for they said , “ This is a place of deep mourning for these Egyptians . ”
1:50:012:0	So Jacob 's sons did as he had commanded them .
1:50:001:1	Joseph Reassures His Brothers
1:50:013:0	They carried his body to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah , near Mamre . This is the cave that Abraham had bought as a permanent burial site from Ephron the Hittite .
1:50:014:0	After burying Jacob , Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to his father 's burial .
1:50:015:0	But now that their father was dead , Joseph 's brothers became fearful . “ Now Joseph will show his anger and pay us back for all the wrong we did to him , ” they said .
1:50:016:0	So they sent this message to Joseph : “ Before your father died , he instructed us
1:50:017:0	to say to you : ‘ Please forgive your brothers for the great wrong they did to you—for their sin in treating you so cruelly . ' So we , the servants of the God of your father , beg you to forgive our sin. ” When Joseph received the message , he broke down and wept .
1:50:018:0	Then his brothers came and threw themselves down before Joseph . “ Look , we are your slaves ! ” they said .
1:50:019:0	But Joseph replied , “ Do n't be afraid of me . Am I God , that I can punish you ?
1:50:020:0	You intended to harm me , but God intended it all for good . He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people .
1:50:002:1	The Death of Joseph
1:50:021:0	No , do n't be afraid . I will continue to take care of you and your children. ” So he reassured them by speaking kindly to them .
1:50:022:0	So Joseph and his brothers and their families continued to live in Egypt . Joseph lived to the age of 110 .
1:50:023:0	He lived to see three generations of descendants of his son Ephraim , and he lived to see the birth of the children of Manasseh 's son Makir , whom he claimed as his own .
1:50:024:0	“ Soon I will die , ” Joseph told his brothers , “ but God will surely come to help you and lead you out of this land of Egypt . He will bring you back to the land he solemnly promised to give to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . ”
1:50:025:0	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath , and he said , “ When God comes to help you and lead you back , you must take my bones with you . ”
1:50:026:0	So Joseph died at the age of 110 . The Egyptians embalmed him , and his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt .
