1:18:001:1	A Son Is Promised to Sarah
1:18:001:0	The Lord appeared again to Abraham near the oak grove belonging to Mamre . One day Abraham was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the hottest part of the day .
1:18:002:0	He looked up and noticed three men standing nearby . When he saw them , he ran to meet them and welcomed them , bowing low to the ground .
1:18:003:0	“ My lord , ” he said , “ if it pleases you , stop here for a while .
1:18:004:0	Rest in the shade of this tree while water is brought to wash your feet .
1:18:005:0	And since you 've honored your servant with this visit , let me prepare some food to refresh you before you continue on your journey. ” “ All right , ” they said . “ Do as you have said . ”
1:18:006:0	So Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah , “ Hurry ! Get three large measures of your best flour , knead it into dough , and bake some bread . ”
1:18:007:0	Then Abraham ran out to the herd and chose a tender calf and gave it to his servant , who quickly prepared it .
1:18:008:0	When the food was ready , Abraham took some yogurt and milk and the roasted meat , and he served it to the men . As they ate , Abraham waited on them in the shade of the trees .
1:18:009:0	“ Where is Sarah , your wife ? ” the visitors asked. “ She 's inside the tent , ” Abraham replied .
1:18:010:0	Then one of them said , “ I will return to you about this time next year , and your wife , Sarah , will have a son ! ” Sarah was listening to this conversation from the tent .
1:18:011:0	Abraham and Sarah were both very old by this time , and Sarah was long past the age of having children .
1:18:012:0	So she laughed silently to herself and said , “ How could a worn-out woman like me enjoy such pleasure , especially when my master—my husband—is also so old ? ”
1:18:013:0	Then the Lord said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh ? Why did she say , ‘ Can an old woman like me have a baby ? '
1:18:014:0	Is anything too hard for the Lord ? I will return about this time next year , and Sarah will have a son . ”
1:18:002:1	Abraham Intercedes for Sodom
1:18:015:0	Sarah was afraid , so she denied it , saying , “ I did n't laugh. ” But the Lord said , “ No , you did laugh . ”
1:18:016:0	Then the men got up from their meal and looked out toward Sodom . As they left , Abraham went with them to send them on their way .
1:18:017:0	“ Should I hide my plan from Abraham ? ” the Lord asked .
1:18:018:0	“ For Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him .
1:18:019:0	I have singled him out so that he will direct his sons and their families to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just . Then I will do for Abraham all that I have promised . ”
1:18:020:0	So the Lord told Abraham , “ I have heard a great outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah , because their sin is so flagrant .
1:18:021:0	I am going down to see if their actions are as wicked as I have heard . If not , I want to know . ”
1:18:022:0	The other men turned and headed toward Sodom , but the Lord remained with Abraham .
1:18:023:0	Abraham approached him and said , “ Will you sweep away both the righteous and the wicked ?
1:18:024:0	Suppose you find fifty righteous people living there in the city—will you still sweep it away and not spare it for their sakes ?
1:18:025:0	Surely you would n't do such a thing , destroying the righteous along with the wicked . Why , you would be treating the righteous and the wicked exactly the same ! Surely you would n't do that ! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is right ? ”
1:18:026:0	And the Lord replied , “ If I find fifty righteous people in Sodom , I will spare the entire city for their sake . ”
1:18:027:0	Then Abraham spoke again . “ Since I have begun , let me speak further to my Lord , even though I am but dust and ashes .
1:18:028:0	Suppose there are only forty-five righteous people rather than fifty ? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five ? ” And the Lord said , “ I will not destroy it if I find forty-five righteous people there . ”
1:18:029:0	Then Abraham pressed his request further . “ Suppose there are only forty ? ” And the Lord replied , “ I will not destroy it for the sake of the forty . ”
1:18:030:0	“ Please do n't be angry , my Lord , ” Abraham pleaded . “ Let me speak—suppose only thirty righteous people are found ? ” And the Lord replied , “ I will not destroy it if I find thirty . ”
1:18:031:0	Then Abraham said , “ Since I have dared to speak to the Lord , let me continue—suppose there are only twenty ? ” And the Lord replied , “ Then I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty . ”
1:18:032:0	Finally , Abraham said , “ Lord , please do n't be angry with me if I speak one more time . Suppose only ten are found there ? ” And the Lord replied , “ Then I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten . ”
1:18:033:0	When the Lord had finished his conversation with Abraham , he went on his way , and Abraham returned to his tent .
