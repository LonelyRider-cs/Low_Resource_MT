1:16:001:1	The Birth of Ishmael
1:16:001:0	Now Sarai , Abram 's wife , had not been able to bear children for him . But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar .
1:16:002:0	So Sarai said to Abram , “ The Lord has prevented me from having children . Go and sleep with my servant . Perhaps I can have children through her. ” And Abram agreed with Sarai 's proposal .
1:16:003:0	So Sarai , Abram 's wife , took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife . ( This happened ten years after Abram had settled in the land of Canaan . )
1:16:004:0	So Abram had sexual relations with Hagar , and she became pregnant . But when Hagar knew she was pregnant , she began to treat her mistress , Sarai , with contempt .
1:16:005:0	Then Sarai said to Abram , “ This is all your fault ! I put my servant into your arms , but now that she 's pregnant she treats me with contempt . The Lord will show who 's wrong — you or me ! ”
1:16:006:0	Abram replied , “ Look , she is your servant , so deal with her as you see fit. ” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away .
1:16:007:0	The angel of the Lord found Hagar beside a spring of water in the wilderness , along the road to Shur .
1:16:008:0	The angel said to her , “ Hagar , Sarai 's servant , where have you come from , and where are you going ? ” “ I 'm running away from my mistress , Sarai , ” she replied .
1:16:009:0	The angel of the Lord said to her , “ Return to your mistress , and submit to her authority . ”
1:16:010:0	Then he added , “ I will give you more descendants than you can count . ”
1:16:011:0	And the angel also said , “ You are now pregnant and will give birth to a son . You are to name him Ishmael ( which means ‘ God hears ' ) , for the Lord has heard your cry of distress .
1:16:012:0	This son of yours will be a wild man , as untamed as a wild donkey ! He will raise his fist against everyone , and everyone will be against him . Yes , he will live in open hostility against all his relatives . ”
1:16:013:0	Thereafter , Hagar used another name to refer to the Lord , who had spoken to her . She said , “ You are the God who sees me. ” She also said , “ Have I truly seen the One who sees me ? ”
1:16:014:0	So that well was named Beer-lahai-roi ( which means “ well of the Living One who sees me ” ) . It can still be found between Kadesh and Bered .
1:16:015:0	So Hagar gave Abram a son , and Abram named him Ishmael .
1:16:016:0	Abram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born .
