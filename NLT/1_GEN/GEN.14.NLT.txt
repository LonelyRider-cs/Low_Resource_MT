1:14:001:1	Abram Rescues Lot
1:14:001:0	About this time war broke out in the region . King Amraphel of Babylonia , King Arioch of Ellasar , King Kedorlaomer of Elam , and King Tidal of Goiim
1:14:002:0	fought against King Bera of Sodom , King Birsha of Gomorrah , King Shinab of Admah , King Shemeber of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( also called Zoar ) .
1:14:003:0	This second group of kings joined forces in Siddim Valley ( that is , the valley of the Dead Sea ) .
1:14:004:0	For twelve years they had been subject to King Kedorlaomer , but in the thirteenth year they rebelled against him .
1:14:005:0	One year later Kedorlaomer and his allies arrived and defeated the Rephaites at Ashteroth-karnaim , the Zuzites at Ham , the Emites at Shaveh-kiriathaim ,
1:14:006:0	and the Horites at Mount Seir , as far as El-paran at the edge of the wilderness .
1:14:007:0	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat ( now called Kadesh ) and conquered all the territory of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar .
1:14:008:0	Then the rebel kings of Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , Zeboiim , and Bela ( also called Zoar ) prepared for battle in the valley of the Dead Sea .
1:14:009:0	They fought against King Kedorlaomer of Elam , King Tidal of Goiim , King Amraphel of Babylonia , and King Arioch of Ellasar — four kings against five .
1:14:010:0	As it happened , the valley of the Dead Sea was filled with tar pits . And as the army of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , some fell into the tar pits , while the rest escaped into the mountains .
1:14:011:0	The victorious invaders then plundered Sodom and Gomorrah and headed for home , taking with them all the spoils of war and the food supplies .
1:14:012:0	They also captured Lot — Abram 's nephew who lived in Sodom — and carried off everything he owned .
1:14:013:0	But one of Lot 's men escaped and reported everything to Abram the Hebrew , who was living near the oak grove belonging to Mamre the Amorite . Mamre and his relatives , Eshcol and Aner , were Abram 's allies .
1:14:014:0	When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been captured , he mobilized the 318 trained men who had been born into his household . Then he pursued Kedorlaomer 's army until he caught up with them at Dan .
1:14:015:0	There he divided his men and attacked during the night . Kedorlaomer 's army fled , but Abram chased them as far as Hobah , north of Damascus .
1:14:002:1	Melchizedek Blesses Abram
1:14:016:0	Abram recovered all the goods that had been taken , and he brought back his nephew Lot with his possessions and all the women and other captives .
1:14:017:0	After Abram returned from his victory over Kedorlaomer and all his allies , the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the valley of Shaveh ( that is , the King 's Valley ) .
1:14:018:0	And Melchizedek , the king of Salem and a priest of God Most High , brought Abram some bread and wine .
1:14:019:0	Melchizedek blessed Abram with this blessing : “ Blessed be Abram by God Most High , Creator of heaven and earth .
1:14:020:0	And blessed be God Most High , who has defeated your enemies for you. ” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the goods he had recovered .
1:14:021:0	The king of Sodom said to Abram , “ Give back my people who were captured . But you may keep for yourself all the goods you have recovered . ”
1:14:022:0	Abram replied to the king of Sodom , “ I solemnly swear to the Lord , God Most High , Creator of heaven and earth ,
1:14:023:0	that I will not take so much as a single thread or sandal thong from what belongs to you . Otherwise you might say , ‘ I am the one who made Abram rich . '
1:14:024:0	I will accept only what my young warriors have already eaten , and I request that you give a fair share of the goods to my allies — Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . ”
