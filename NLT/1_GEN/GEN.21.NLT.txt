1:21:001:1	The Birth of Isaac
1:21:001:0	The Lord kept his word and did for Sarah exactly what he had promised .
1:21:002:0	She became pregnant , and she gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age . This happened at just the time God had said it would .
1:21:003:0	And Abraham named their son Isaac .
1:21:004:0	Eight days after Isaac was born , Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded .
1:21:005:0	Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born .
1:21:006:0	And Sarah declared , “ God has brought me laughter . All who hear about this will laugh with me .
1:21:002:1	Hagar and Ishmael Are Sent Away
1:21:007:0	Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse a baby ? Yet I have given Abraham a son in his old age ! ”
1:21:008:0	When Isaac grew up and was about to be weaned , Abraham prepared a huge feast to celebrate the occasion .
1:21:009:0	But Sarah saw Ishmael—the son of Abraham and her Egyptian servant Hagar—making fun of her son , Isaac .
1:21:010:0	So she turned to Abraham and demanded , “ Get rid of that slave woman and her son . He is not going to share the inheritance with my son , Isaac . I wo n't have it ! ”
1:21:011:0	This upset Abraham very much because Ishmael was his son .
1:21:012:0	But God told Abraham , “ Do not be upset over the boy and your servant . Do whatever Sarah tells you , for Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted .
1:21:013:0	But I will also make a nation of the descendants of Hagar 's son because he is your son , too . ”
1:21:014:0	So Abraham got up early the next morning , prepared food and a container of water , and strapped them on Hagar 's shoulders . Then he sent her away with their son , and she wandered aimlessly in the wilderness of Beersheba .
1:21:015:0	When the water was gone , she put the boy in the shade of a bush .
1:21:016:0	Then she went and sat down by herself about a hundred yards away . “ I do n't want to watch the boy die , ” she said , as she burst into tears .
1:21:017:0	But God heard the boy crying , and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven , “ Hagar , what 's wrong ? Do not be afraid ! God has heard the boy crying as he lies there .
1:21:018:0	Go to him and comfort him , for I will make a great nation from his descendants . ”
1:21:019:0	Then God opened Hagar 's eyes , and she saw a well full of water . She quickly filled her water container and gave the boy a drink .
1:21:020:0	And God was with the boy as he grew up in the wilderness . He became a skillful archer ,
1:21:003:1	Abraham 's Covenant with Abimelech
1:21:021:0	and he settled in the wilderness of Paran . His mother arranged for him to marry a woman from the land of Egypt .
1:21:022:0	About this time , Abimelech came with Phicol , his army commander , to visit Abraham . “ God is obviously with you , helping you in everything you do , ” Abimelech said .
1:21:023:0	“ Swear to me in God 's name that you will never deceive me , my children , or any of my descendants . I have been loyal to you , so now swear that you will be loyal to me and to this country where you are living as a foreigner . ”
1:21:024:0	Abraham replied , “ Yes , I swear to it ! ”
1:21:025:0	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech 's servants had taken by force from Abraham 's servants .
1:21:026:0	“ This is the first I 've heard of it , ” Abimelech answered . “ I have no idea who is responsible . You have never complained about this before . ”
1:21:027:0	Abraham then gave some of his sheep , goats , and cattle to Abimelech , and they made a treaty .
1:21:028:0	But Abraham also took seven additional female lambs and set them off by themselves .
1:21:029:0	Abimelech asked , “ Why have you set these seven apart from the others ? ”
1:21:030:0	Abraham replied , “ Please accept these seven lambs to show your agreement that I dug this well . ”
1:21:031:0	Then he named the place Beersheba ( which means “ well of the oath ” ) , because that was where they had sworn the oath .
1:21:032:0	After making their covenant at Beersheba , Abimelech left with Phicol , the commander of his army , and they returned home to the land of the Philistines .
1:21:033:0	Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba , and there he worshiped the Lord , the Eternal God .
1:21:034:0	And Abraham lived as a foreigner in Philistine country for a long time .
