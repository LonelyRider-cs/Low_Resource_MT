1:6:001:1	A World Gone Wrong
1:6:001:0	Then the people began to multiply on the earth , and daughters were born to them .
1:6:002:0	The sons of God saw the beautiful women and took any they wanted as their wives .
1:6:003:0	Then the Lord said , “ My Spirit will not put up with humans for such a long time , for they are only mortal flesh . In the future , their normal lifespan will be no more than 120 years . ”
1:6:004:0	In those days , and for some time after , giant Nephilites lived on the earth , for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women , they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times .
1:6:005:0	The Lord observed the extent of human wickedness on the earth , and he saw that everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil .
1:6:006:0	So the Lord was sorry he had ever made them and put them on the earth . It broke his heart .
1:6:007:0	And the Lord said , “ I will wipe this human race I have created from the face of the earth . Yes , and I will destroy every living thing — all the people , the large animals , the small animals that scurry along the ground , and even the birds of the sky . I am sorry I ever made them . ”
1:6:002:1	The Story of Noah
1:6:008:0	But Noah found favor with the Lord .
1:6:009:0	This is the account of Noah and his family . Noah was a righteous man , the only blameless person living on earth at the time , and he walked in close fellowship with God .
1:6:010:0	Noah was the father of three sons : Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
1:6:011:0	Now God saw that the earth had become corrupt and was filled with violence .
1:6:012:0	God observed all this corruption in the world , for everyone on earth was corrupt .
1:6:013:0	So God said to Noah , “ I have decided to destroy all living creatures , for they have filled the earth with violence . Yes , I will wipe them all out along with the earth !
1:6:014:0	“ Build a large boat from cypress wood and waterproof it with tar , inside and out . Then construct decks and stalls throughout its interior .
1:6:015:0	Make the boat 450 feet long , 75 feet wide , and 45 feet high .
1:6:016:0	Leave an 18-inch opening below the roof all the way around the boat . Put the door on the side , and build three decks inside the boat — lower , middle , and upper .
1:6:017:0	“ Look ! I am about to cover the earth with a flood that will destroy every living thing that breathes . Everything on earth will die .
1:6:018:0	But I will confirm my covenant with you . So enter the boat — you and your wife and your sons and their wives .
1:6:019:0	Bring a pair of every kind of animal — a male and a female — into the boat with you to keep them alive during the flood .
1:6:020:0	Pairs of every kind of bird , and every kind of animal , and every kind of small animal that scurries along the ground , will come to you to be kept alive .
1:6:021:0	And be sure to take on board enough food for your family and for all the animals . ”
1:6:022:0	So Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him .
