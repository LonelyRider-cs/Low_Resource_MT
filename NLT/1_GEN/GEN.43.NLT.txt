1:43:001:1	The Brothers Return to Egypt
1:43:001:0	But the famine continued to ravage the land of Canaan .
1:43:002:0	When the grain they had brought from Egypt was almost gone , Jacob said to his sons , “ Go back and buy us a little more food . ”
1:43:003:0	But Judah said , “ The man was serious when he warned us , ‘ You wo n't see my face again unless your brother is with you . '
1:43:004:0	If you send Benjamin with us , we will go down and buy more food .
1:43:005:0	But if you do n't let Benjamin go , we wo n't go either . Remember , the man said , ‘ You wo n't see my face again unless your brother is with you . ' ”
1:43:006:0	“ Why were you so cruel to me ? ” Jacob moaned . “ Why did you tell him you had another brother ? ”
1:43:007:0	“ The man kept asking us questions about our family , ” they replied . “ He asked , ‘ Is your father still alive ? Do you have another brother ? ' So we answered his questions . How could we know he would say , ‘ Bring your brother down here ' ? ”
1:43:008:0	Judah said to his father , “ Send the boy with me , and we will be on our way . Otherwise we will all die of starvation — and not only we , but you and our little ones .
1:43:009:0	I personally guarantee his safety . You may hold me responsible if I do n't bring him back to you . Then let me bear the blame forever .
1:43:010:0	If we had n't wasted all this time , we could have gone and returned twice by now . ”
1:43:011:0	So their father , Jacob , finally said to them , “ If it ca n't be avoided , then at least do this . Pack your bags with the best products of this land . Take them down to the man as gifts — balm , honey , gum , aromatic resin , pistachio nuts , and almonds .
1:43:012:0	Also take double the money that was put back in your sacks , as it was probably someone 's mistake .
1:43:013:0	Then take your brother , and go back to the man .
1:43:014:0	May God Almighty give you mercy as you go before the man , so that he will release Simeon and let Benjamin return . But if I must lose my children , so be it . ”
1:43:015:0	So the men packed Jacob 's gifts and double the money and headed off with Benjamin . They finally arrived in Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph .
1:43:016:0	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the manager of his household , “ These men will eat with me this noon . Take them inside the palace . Then go slaughter an animal , and prepare a big feast . ”
1:43:017:0	So the man did as Joseph told him and took them into Joseph 's palace .
1:43:002:1	A Feast at Joseph 's Palace
1:43:018:0	The brothers were terrified when they saw that they were being taken into Joseph 's house . “ It 's because of the money someone put in our sacks last time we were here , ” they said . “ He plans to pretend that we stole it . Then he will seize us , make us slaves , and take our donkeys . ”
1:43:019:0	The brothers approached the manager of Joseph 's household and spoke to him at the entrance to the palace .
1:43:020:0	“ Sir , ” they said , “ we came to Egypt once before to buy food .
1:43:021:0	But as we were returning home , we stopped for the night and opened our sacks . Then we discovered that each man 's money — the exact amount paid — was in the top of his sack ! Here it is ; we have brought it back with us .
1:43:022:0	We also have additional money to buy more food . We have no idea who put our money in our sacks . ”
1:43:023:0	“ Relax . Do n't be afraid , ” the household manager told them . “ Your God , the God of your father , must have put this treasure into your sacks . I know I received your payment. ” Then he released Simeon and brought him out to them .
1:43:024:0	The manager then led the men into Joseph 's palace . He gave them water to wash their feet and provided food for their donkeys .
1:43:025:0	They were told they would be eating there , so they prepared their gifts for Joseph 's arrival at noon .
1:43:026:0	When Joseph came home , they gave him the gifts they had brought him , then bowed low to the ground before him .
1:43:027:0	After greeting them , he asked , “ How is your father , the old man you spoke about ? Is he still alive ? ”
1:43:028:0	“ Yes , ” they replied . “ Our father , your servant , is alive and well. ” And they bowed low again .
1:43:029:0	Then Joseph looked at his brother Benjamin , the son of his own mother . “ Is this your youngest brother , the one you told me about ? ” Joseph asked . “ May God be gracious to you , my son . ”
1:43:030:0	Then Joseph hurried from the room because he was overcome with emotion for his brother . He went into his private room , where he broke down and wept .
1:43:031:0	After washing his face , he came back out , keeping himself under control . Then he ordered , “ Bring out the food ! ”
1:43:032:0	The waiters served Joseph at his own table , and his brothers were served at a separate table . The Egyptians who ate with Joseph sat at their own table , because Egyptians despise Hebrews and refuse to eat with them .
1:43:033:0	Joseph told each of his brothers where to sit , and to their amazement , he seated them according to age , from oldest to youngest .
1:43:034:0	And Joseph filled their plates with food from his own table , giving Benjamin five times as much as he gave the others . So they feasted and drank freely with him .
