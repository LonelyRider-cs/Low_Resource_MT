1:45:001:1	Joseph Reveals His Identity
1:45:001:0	Joseph could stand it no longer . There were many people in the room , and he said to his attendants , “ Out , all of you ! ” So he was alone with his brothers when he told them who he was .
1:45:002:0	Then he broke down and wept . He wept so loudly the Egyptians could hear him , and word of it quickly carried to Pharaoh 's palace .
1:45:003:0	“ I am Joseph ! ” he said to his brothers . “ Is my father still alive ? ” But his brothers were speechless ! They were stunned to realize that Joseph was standing there in front of them .
1:45:004:0	“ Please , come closer , ” he said to them . So they came closer . And he said again , “ I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into slavery in Egypt .
1:45:005:0	But do n't be upset , and do n't be angry with yourselves for selling me to this place . It was God who sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives .
1:45:006:0	This famine that has ravaged the land for two years will last five more years , and there will be neither plowing nor harvesting .
1:45:007:0	God has sent me ahead of you to keep you and your families alive and to preserve many survivors .
1:45:008:0	So it was God who sent me here , not you ! And he is the one who made me an adviser to Pharaoh—the manager of his entire palace and the governor of all Egypt .
1:45:009:0	“ Now hurry back to my father and tell him , ‘ This is what your son Joseph says : God has made me master over all the land of Egypt . So come down to me immediately !
1:45:010:0	You can live in the region of Goshen , where you can be near me with all your children and grandchildren , your flocks and herds , and everything you own .
1:45:011:0	I will take care of you there , for there are still five years of famine ahead of us . Otherwise you , your household , and all your animals will starve . ' ”
1:45:012:0	Then Joseph added , “ Look ! You can see for yourselves , and so can my brother Benjamin , that I really am Joseph !
1:45:013:0	Go tell my father of my honored position here in Egypt . Describe for him everything you have seen , and then bring my father here quickly . ”
1:45:014:0	Weeping with joy , he embraced Benjamin , and Benjamin did the same .
1:45:002:1	Pharaoh Invites Jacob to Egypt
1:45:015:0	Then Joseph kissed each of his brothers and wept over them , and after that they began talking freely with him .
1:45:016:0	The news soon reached Pharaoh 's palace : “ Joseph 's brothers have arrived ! ” Pharaoh and his officials were all delighted to hear this .
1:45:017:0	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Tell your brothers , ‘ This is what you must do : Load your pack animals , and hurry back to the land of Canaan .
1:45:018:0	Then get your father and all of your families , and return here to me . I will give you the very best land in Egypt , and you will eat from the best that the land produces . ' ”
1:45:019:0	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Tell your brothers , ‘ Take wagons from the land of Egypt to carry your little children and your wives , and bring your father here .
1:45:020:0	Do n't worry about your personal belongings , for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours . ' ”
1:45:021:0	So the sons of Jacob did as they were told . Joseph provided them with wagons , as Pharaoh had commanded , and he gave them supplies for the journey .
1:45:022:0	And he gave each of them new clothes—but to Benjamin he gave five changes of clothes and 300 pieces of silver .
1:45:023:0	He also sent his father ten male donkeys loaded with the finest products of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other supplies he would need on his journey .
1:45:024:0	So Joseph sent his brothers off , and as they left , he called after them , “ Do n't quarrel about all this along the way ! ”
1:45:025:0	And they left Egypt and returned to their father , Jacob , in the land of Canaan .
1:45:026:0	“ Joseph is still alive ! ” they told him . “ And he is governor of all the land of Egypt ! ” Jacob was stunned at the news—he could n't believe it .
1:45:027:0	But when they repeated to Jacob everything Joseph had told them , and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him , their father 's spirits revived .
1:45:028:0	Then Jacob exclaimed , “ It must be true ! My son Joseph is alive ! I must go and see him before I die . ”
