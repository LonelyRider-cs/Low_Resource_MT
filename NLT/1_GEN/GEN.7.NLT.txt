1:7:001:1	The Flood Covers the Earth
1:7:001:0	When everything was ready , the Lord said to Noah , “ Go into the boat with all your family , for among all the people of the earth , I can see that you alone are righteous .
1:7:002:0	Take with you seven pairs — male and female — of each animal I have approved for eating and for sacrifice , and take one pair of each of the others .
1:7:003:0	Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird . There must be a male and a female in each pair to ensure that all life will survive on the earth after the flood .
1:7:004:0	Seven days from now I will make the rains pour down on the earth . And it will rain for forty days and forty nights , until I have wiped from the earth all the living things I have created . ”
1:7:005:0	So Noah did everything as the Lord commanded him .
1:7:006:0	Noah was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth .
1:7:007:0	He went on board the boat to escape the flood — he and his wife and his sons and their wives .
1:7:008:0	With them were all the various kinds of animals — those approved for eating and for sacrifice and those that were not — along with all the birds and the small animals that scurry along the ground .
1:7:009:0	They entered the boat in pairs , male and female , just as God had commanded Noah .
1:7:010:0	After seven days , the waters of the flood came and covered the earth .
1:7:011:0	When Noah was 600 years old , on the seventeenth day of the second month , all the underground waters erupted from the earth , and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky .
1:7:012:0	The rain continued to fall for forty days and forty nights .
1:7:013:0	That very day Noah had gone into the boat with his wife and his sons — Shem , Ham , and Japheth — and their wives .
1:7:014:0	With them in the boat were pairs of every kind of animal — domestic and wild , large and small — along with birds of every kind .
1:7:015:0	Two by two they came into the boat , representing every living thing that breathes .
1:7:016:0	A male and female of each kind entered , just as God had commanded Noah . Then the Lord closed the door behind them .
1:7:017:0	For forty days the floodwaters grew deeper , covering the ground and lifting the boat high above the earth .
1:7:018:0	As the waters rose higher and higher above the ground , the boat floated safely on the surface .
1:7:019:0	Finally , the water covered even the highest mountains on the earth ,
1:7:020:0	rising more than twenty-two feet above the highest peaks .
1:7:021:0	All the living things on earth died — birds , domestic animals , wild animals , small animals that scurry along the ground , and all the people .
1:7:022:0	Everything that breathed and lived on dry land died .
1:7:023:0	God wiped out every living thing on the earth — people , livestock , small animals that scurry along the ground , and the birds of the sky . All were destroyed . The only people who survived were Noah and those with him in the boat .
1:7:024:0	And the floodwaters covered the earth for 150 days .
