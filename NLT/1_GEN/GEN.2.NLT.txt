1:2:001:0	So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed .
1:2:002:0	On the seventh day God had finished his work of creation , so he rested from all his work .
1:2:003:0	And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy , because it was the day when he rested from all his work of creation .
1:2:001:1	The Man and Woman in Eden
1:2:004:0	This is the account of the creation of the heavens and the earth.When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
1:2:005:0	neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth . For the Lord God had not yet sent rain to water the earth , and there were no people to cultivate the soil .
1:2:006:0	Instead , springs came up from the ground and watered all the land .
1:2:007:0	Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground . He breathed the breath of life into the man 's nostrils , and the man became a living person .
1:2:008:0	Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east , and there he placed the man he had made .
1:2:009:0	The Lord God made all sorts of trees grow up from the ground — trees that were beautiful and that produced delicious fruit . In the middle of the garden he placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
1:2:010:0	A river flowed from the land of Eden , watering the garden and then dividing into four branches .
1:2:011:0	The first branch , called the Pishon , flowed around the entire land of Havilah , where gold is found .
1:2:012:0	The gold of that land is exceptionally pure ; aromatic resin and onyx stone are also found there .
1:2:013:0	The second branch , called the Gihon , flowed around the entire land of Cush .
1:2:014:0	The third branch , called the Tigris , flowed east of the land of Asshur . The fourth branch is called the Euphrates .
1:2:015:0	The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to tend and watch over it .
1:2:016:0	But the Lord God warned him , “ You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden —
1:2:017:0	except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . If you eat its fruit , you are sure to die . ”
1:2:018:0	Then the Lord God said , “ It is not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper who is just right for him . ”
1:2:019:0	So the Lord God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky . He brought them to the man to see what he would call them , and the man chose a name for each one .
1:2:020:0	He gave names to all the livestock , all the birds of the sky , and all the wild animals . But still there was no helper just right for him .
1:2:021:0	So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep . While the man slept , the Lord God took out one of the man 's ribs and closed up the opening .
1:2:022:0	Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib , and he brought her to the man .
1:2:023:0	“ At last ! ” the man exclaimed. “ This one is bone from my bone , and flesh from my flesh ! She will be called ‘ woman , 'because she was taken from ‘ man . ' ”
1:2:024:0	This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife , and the two are united into one .
1:2:025:0	Now the man and his wife were both naked , but they felt no shame .
