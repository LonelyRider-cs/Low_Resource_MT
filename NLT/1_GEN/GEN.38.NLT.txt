1:38:001:1	Judah and Tamar
1:38:001:0	About this time , Judah left home and moved to Adullam , where he stayed with a man named Hirah .
1:38:002:0	There he saw a Canaanite woman , the daughter of Shua , and he married her . When he slept with her ,
1:38:003:0	she became pregnant and gave birth to a son , and he named the boy Er .
1:38:004:0	Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son , and she named him Onan .
1:38:005:0	And when she gave birth to a third son , she named him Shelah . At the time of Shelah 's birth , they were living at Kezib .
1:38:006:0	In the course of time , Judah arranged for his firstborn son , Er , to marry a young woman named Tamar .
1:38:007:0	But Er was a wicked man in the Lord 's sight , so the Lord took his life .
1:38:008:0	Then Judah said to Er 's brother Onan , “ Go and marry Tamar , as our law requires of the brother of a man who has died . You must produce an heir for your brother . ”
1:38:009:0	But Onan was not willing to have a child who would not be his own heir . So whenever he had intercourse with his brother 's wife , he spilled the semen on the ground . This prevented her from having a child who would belong to his brother .
1:38:010:0	But the Lord considered it evil for Onan to deny a child to his dead brother . So the Lord took Onan 's life , too .
1:38:011:0	Then Judah said to Tamar , his daughter-in-law , “ Go back to your parents ' home and remain a widow until my son Shelah is old enough to marry you. ” ( But Judah did n't really intend to do this because he was afraid Shelah would also die , like his two brothers . ) So Tamar went back to live in her father 's home .
1:38:012:0	Some years later Judah 's wife died . After the time of mourning was over , Judah and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to Timnah to supervise the shearing of his sheep .
1:38:013:0	Someone told Tamar , “ Look , your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep . ”
1:38:014:0	Tamar was aware that Shelah had grown up , but no arrangements had been made for her to come and marry him . So she changed out of her widow 's clothing and covered herself with a veil to disguise herself . Then she sat beside the road at the entrance to the village of Enaim , which is on the road to Timnah .
1:38:015:0	Judah noticed her and thought she was a prostitute , since she had covered her face .
1:38:016:0	So he stopped and propositioned her . “ Let me have sex with you , ” he said , not realizing that she was his own daughter-in-law. “ How much will you pay to have sex with me ? ” Tamar asked .
1:38:017:0	“ I 'll send you a young goat from my flock , ” Judah promised. “ But what will you give me to guarantee that you will send the goat ? ” she asked .
1:38:018:0	“ What kind of guarantee do you want ? ” he replied.She answered , “ Leave me your identification seal and its cord and the walking stick you are carrying. ” So Judah gave them to her . Then he had intercourse with her , and she became pregnant .
1:38:019:0	Afterward she went back home , took off her veil , and put on her widow 's clothing as usual .
1:38:020:0	Later Judah asked his friend Hirah the Adullamite to take the young goat to the woman and to pick up the things he had given her as his guarantee . But Hirah could n't find her .
1:38:021:0	So he asked the men who lived there , “ Where can I find the shrine prostitute who was sitting beside the road at the entrance to Enaim ? ” “ We 've never had a shrine prostitute here , ” they replied .
1:38:022:0	So Hirah returned to Judah and told him , “ I could n't find her anywhere , and the men of the village claim they 've never had a shrine prostitute there . ”
1:38:023:0	“ Then let her keep the things I gave her , ” Judah said . “ I sent the young goat as we agreed , but you could n't find her . We 'd be the laughingstock of the village if we went back again to look for her . ”
1:38:024:0	About three months later , Judah was told , “ Tamar , your daughter-in-law , has acted like a prostitute . And now , because of this , she 's pregnant. ” “ Bring her out , and let her be burned ! ” Judah demanded .
1:38:025:0	But as they were taking her out to kill her , she sent this message to her father-in-law : “ The man who owns these things made me pregnant . Look closely . Whose seal and cord and walking stick are these ? ”
1:38:026:0	Judah recognized them immediately and said , “ She is more righteous than I am , because I did n't arrange for her to marry my son Shelah. ” And Judah never slept with Tamar again .
1:38:027:0	When the time came for Tamar to give birth , it was discovered that she was carrying twins .
1:38:028:0	While she was in labor , one of the babies reached out his hand . The midwife grabbed it and tied a scarlet string around the child 's wrist , announcing , “ This one came out first . ”
1:38:029:0	But then he pulled back his hand , and out came his brother ! “ What ! ” the midwife exclaimed . “ How did you break out first ? ” So he was named Perez .
1:38:030:0	Then the baby with the scarlet string on his wrist was born , and he was named Zerah .
