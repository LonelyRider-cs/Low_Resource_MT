1:28:001:0	So Isaac called for Jacob , blessed him , and said , “ You must not marry any of these Canaanite women .
1:28:002:0	Instead , go at once to Paddan-aram , to the house of your grandfather Bethuel , and marry one of your uncle Laban 's daughters .
1:28:003:0	May God Almighty bless you and give you many children . And may your descendants multiply and become many nations !
1:28:004:0	May God pass on to you and your descendants the blessings he promised to Abraham . May you own this land where you are now living as a foreigner , for God gave this land to Abraham . ”
1:28:005:0	So Isaac sent Jacob away , and he went to Paddan-aram to stay with his uncle Laban , his mother 's brother , the son of Bethuel the Aramean .
1:28:006:0	Esau knew that his father , Isaac , had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to find a wife , and that he had warned Jacob , “ You must not marry a Canaanite woman . ”
1:28:007:0	He also knew that Jacob had obeyed his parents and gone to Paddan-aram .
1:28:008:0	It was now very clear to Esau that his father did not like the local Canaanite women .
1:28:001:1	Jacob 's Dream at Bethel
1:28:009:0	So Esau visited his uncle Ishmael 's family and married one of Ishmael 's daughters , in addition to the wives he already had . His new wife 's name was Mahalath . She was the sister of Nebaioth and the daughter of Ishmael , Abraham 's son .
1:28:010:0	Meanwhile , Jacob left Beersheba and traveled toward Haran .
1:28:011:0	At sundown he arrived at a good place to set up camp and stopped there for the night . Jacob found a stone to rest his head against and lay down to sleep .
1:28:012:0	As he slept , he dreamed of a stairway that reached from the earth up to heaven . And he saw the angels of God going up and down the stairway .
1:28:013:0	At the top of the stairway stood the Lord , and he said , “ I am the Lord , the God of your grandfather Abraham , and the God of your father , Isaac . The ground you are lying on belongs to you . I am giving it to you and your descendants .
1:28:014:0	Your descendants will be as numerous as the dust of the earth ! They will spread out in all directions — to the west and the east , to the north and the south . And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants .
1:28:015:0	What 's more , I am with you , and I will protect you wherever you go . One day I will bring you back to this land . I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you . ”
1:28:016:0	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said , “ Surely the Lord is in this place , and I was n't even aware of it ! ”
1:28:017:0	But he was also afraid and said , “ What an awesome place this is ! It is none other than the house of God , the very gateway to heaven ! ”
1:28:018:0	The next morning Jacob got up very early . He took the stone he had rested his head against , and he set it upright as a memorial pillar . Then he poured olive oil over it .
1:28:019:0	He named that place Bethel ( which means “ house of God ” ) , although it was previously called Luz .
1:28:020:0	Then Jacob made this vow : “ If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey , and if he will provide me with food and clothing ,
1:28:021:0	and if I return safely to my father 's home , then the Lord will certainly be my God .
1:28:022:0	And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God , and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me . ”
