1:9:001:1	God Confirms His Covenant
1:9:001:0	Then God blessed Noah and his sons and told them , “ Be fruitful and multiply . Fill the earth .
1:9:002:0	All the animals of the earth , all the birds of the sky , all the small animals that scurry along the ground , and all the fish in the sea will look on you with fear and terror . I have placed them in your power .
1:9:003:0	I have given them to you for food , just as I have given you grain and vegetables .
1:9:004:0	But you must never eat any meat that still has the lifeblood in it .
1:9:005:0	“ And I will require the blood of anyone who takes another person 's life . If a wild animal kills a person , it must die . And anyone who murders a fellow human must die .
1:9:006:0	If anyone takes a human life , that person 's life will also be taken by human hands . For God made human beings in his own image .
1:9:007:0	Now be fruitful and multiply , and repopulate the earth . ”
1:9:008:0	Then God told Noah and his sons ,
1:9:009:0	“ I hereby confirm my covenant with you and your descendants ,
1:9:010:0	and with all the animals that were on the boat with you—the birds , the livestock , and all the wild animals—every living creature on earth .
1:9:011:0	Yes , I am confirming my covenant with you . Never again will floodwaters kill all living creatures ; never again will a flood destroy the earth . ”
1:9:012:0	Then God said , “ I am giving you a sign of my covenant with you and with all living creatures , for all generations to come .
1:9:013:0	I have placed my rainbow in the clouds . It is the sign of my covenant with you and with all the earth .
1:9:014:0	When I send clouds over the earth , the rainbow will appear in the clouds ,
1:9:015:0	and I will remember my covenant with you and with all living creatures . Never again will the floodwaters destroy all life .
1:9:016:0	When I see the rainbow in the clouds , I will remember the eternal covenant between God and every living creature on earth . ”
1:9:002:1	Noah 's Sons
1:9:017:0	Then God said to Noah , “ Yes , this rainbow is the sign of the covenant I am confirming with all the creatures on earth . ”
1:9:018:0	The sons of Noah who came out of the boat with their father were Shem , Ham , and Japheth . ( Ham is the father of Canaan . )
1:9:019:0	From these three sons of Noah came all the people who now populate the earth .
1:9:020:0	After the flood , Noah began to cultivate the ground , and he planted a vineyard .
1:9:021:0	One day he drank some wine he had made , and he became drunk and lay naked inside his tent .
1:9:022:0	Ham , the father of Canaan , saw that his father was naked and went outside and told his brothers .
1:9:023:0	Then Shem and Japheth took a robe , held it over their shoulders , and backed into the tent to cover their father . As they did this , they looked the other way so they would not see him naked .
1:9:024:0	When Noah woke up from his stupor , he learned what Ham , his youngest son , had done .
1:9:025:0	Then he cursed Canaan , the son of Ham : “ May Canaan be cursed ! May he be the lowest of servants to his relatives . ”
1:9:026:0	Then Noah said , “ May the Lord , the God of Shem , be blessed , and may Canaan be his servant !
1:9:027:0	May God expand the territory of Japheth ! May Japheth share the prosperity of Shem , and may Canaan be his servant . ”
1:9:028:0	Noah lived another 350 years after the great flood .
1:9:029:0	He lived 950 years , and then he died .
