1:12:001:1	The Call of Abram
1:12:001:0	The Lord had said to Abram , “ Leave your native country , your relatives , and your father 's family , and go to the land that I will show you .
1:12:002:0	I will make you into a great nation . I will bless you and make you famous , and you will be a blessing to others .
1:12:003:0	I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with contempt . All the families on earth will be blessed through you . ”
1:12:004:0	So Abram departed as the Lord had instructed , and Lot went with him . Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran .
1:12:005:0	He took his wife , Sarai , his nephew Lot , and all his wealth — his livestock and all the people he had taken into his household at Haran — and headed for the land of Canaan . When they arrived in Canaan ,
1:12:006:0	Abram traveled through the land as far as Shechem . There he set up camp beside the oak of Moreh . At that time , the area was inhabited by Canaanites .
1:12:007:0	Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said , “ I will give this land to your descendants. ” And Abram built an altar there and dedicated it to the Lord , who had appeared to him .
1:12:008:0	After that , Abram traveled south and set up camp in the hill country , with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east . There he built another altar and dedicated it to the Lord , and he worshiped the Lord .

1:12:009:0	Then Abram continued traveling south by stages toward the Negev .
1:12:010:0	At that time a severe famine struck the land of Canaan , forcing Abram to go down to Egypt , where he lived as a foreigner .
1:12:011:0	As he was approaching the border of Egypt , Abram said to his wife , Sarai , “ Look , you are a very beautiful woman .
1:12:012:0	When the Egyptians see you , they will say , ‘ This is his wife . Let 's kill him ; then we can have her ! '
1:12:013:0	So please tell them you are my sister . Then they will spare my life and treat me well because of their interest in you . ”
1:12:014:0	And sure enough , when Abram arrived in Egypt , everyone noticed Sarai 's beauty .
1:12:015:0	When the palace officials saw her , they sang her praises to Pharaoh , their king , and Sarai was taken into his palace .
1:12:016:0	Then Pharaoh gave Abram many gifts because of her — sheep , goats , cattle , male and female donkeys , male and female servants , and camels .
1:12:017:0	But the Lord sent terrible plagues upon Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai , Abram 's wife .
1:12:018:0	So Pharaoh summoned Abram and accused him sharply . “ What have you done to me ? ” he demanded . “ Why did n't you tell me she was your wife ?
1:12:019:0	Why did you say , ‘ She is my sister , ' and allow me to take her as my wife ? Now then , here is your wife . Take her and get out of here ! ”
1:12:020:0	Pharaoh ordered some of his men to escort them , and he sent Abram out of the country , along with his wife and all his possessions .
