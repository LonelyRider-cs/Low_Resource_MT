1:4:001:1	Cain and Abel
1:4:001:0	Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife , Eve , and she became pregnant . When she gave birth to Cain , she said , “ With the Lord 's help , I have produced a man ! ”
1:4:002:0	Later she gave birth to his brother and named him Abel.When they grew up , Abel became a shepherd , while Cain cultivated the ground .
1:4:003:0	When it was time for the harvest , Cain presented some of his crops as a gift to the Lord .
1:4:004:0	Abel also brought a gift—the best portions of the firstborn lambs from his flock . The Lord accepted Abel and his gift ,
1:4:005:0	but he did not accept Cain and his gift . This made Cain very angry , and he looked dejected .
1:4:006:0	“ Why are you so angry ? ” the Lord asked Cain . “ Why do you look so dejected ?
1:4:007:0	You will be accepted if you do what is right . But if you refuse to do what is right , then watch out ! Sin is crouching at the door , eager to control you . But you must subdue it and be its master . ”
1:4:008:0	One day Cain suggested to his brother , “ Let 's go out into the fields. ” And while they were in the field , Cain attacked his brother , Abel , and killed him .
1:4:009:0	Afterward the Lord asked Cain , “ Where is your brother ? Where is Abel ? ” “ I do n't know , ” Cain responded . “ Am I my brother 's guardian ? ”
1:4:010:0	But the Lord said , “ What have you done ? Listen ! Your brother 's blood cries out to me from the ground !
1:4:011:0	Now you are cursed and banished from the ground , which has swallowed your brother 's blood .
1:4:012:0	No longer will the ground yield good crops for you , no matter how hard you work ! From now on you will be a homeless wanderer on the earth . ”
1:4:013:0	Cain replied to the Lord , “ My punishment is too great for me to bear !
1:4:014:0	You have banished me from the land and from your presence ; you have made me a homeless wanderer . Anyone who finds me will kill me ! ”
1:4:015:0	The Lord replied , “ No , for I will give a sevenfold punishment to anyone who kills you. ” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain to warn anyone who might try to kill him .
1:4:002:1	The Descendants of Cain
1:4:016:0	So Cain left the Lord 's presence and settled in the land of Nod , east of Eden .
1:4:017:0	Cain had sexual relations with his wife , and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch . Then Cain founded a city , which he named Enoch , after his son .
1:4:018:0	Enoch had a son named Irad . Irad became the father of Mehujael . Mehujael became the father of Methushael . Methushael became the father of Lamech .
1:4:019:0	Lamech married two women . The first was named Adah , and the second was Zillah .
1:4:020:0	Adah gave birth to Jabal , who was the first of those who raise livestock and live in tents .
1:4:021:0	His brother 's name was Jubal , the first of all who play the harp and flute .
1:4:022:0	Lamech 's other wife , Zillah , gave birth to a son named Tubal-cain . He became an expert in forging tools of bronze and iron . Tubal-cain had a sister named Naamah .
1:4:023:0	One day Lamech said to his wives , “ Adah and Zillah , hear my voice ; listen to me , you wives of Lamech.I have killed a man who attacked me , a young man who wounded me .
1:4:003:1	The Birth of Seth
1:4:024:0	If someone who kills Cain is punished seven times , then the one who kills me will be punished seventy-seven times ! ”
1:4:025:0	Adam had sexual relations with his wife again , and she gave birth to another son . She named him Seth , for she said , “ God has granted me another son in place of Abel , whom Cain killed . ”
1:4:026:0	When Seth grew up , he had a son and named him Enosh . At that time people first began to worship the Lord by name .
