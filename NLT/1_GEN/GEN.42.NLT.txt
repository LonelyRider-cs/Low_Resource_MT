1:42:001:1	Joseph 's Brothers Go to Egypt
1:42:001:0	When Jacob heard that grain was available in Egypt , he said to his sons , “ Why are you standing around looking at one another ?
1:42:002:0	I have heard there is grain in Egypt . Go down there , and buy enough grain to keep us alive . Otherwise we 'll die . ”
1:42:003:0	So Joseph 's ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain .
1:42:004:0	But Jacob would n't let Joseph 's younger brother , Benjamin , go with them , for fear some harm might come to him .
1:42:005:0	So Jacob 's sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food , for the famine was in Canaan as well .
1:42:006:0	Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people , it was to him that his brothers came . When they arrived , they bowed before him with their faces to the ground .
1:42:007:0	Joseph recognized his brothers instantly , but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them . “ Where are you from ? ” he demanded. “ From the land of Canaan , ” they replied . “ We have come to buy food . ”
1:42:008:0	Although Joseph recognized his brothers , they did n't recognize him .
1:42:009:0	And he remembered the dreams he 'd had about them many years before . He said to them , “ You are spies ! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become . ”
1:42:010:0	“ No , my lord ! ” they exclaimed . “ Your servants have simply come to buy food .
1:42:011:0	We are all brothers—members of the same family . We are honest men , sir ! We are not spies ! ”
1:42:012:0	“ Yes , you are ! ” Joseph insisted . “ You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become . ”
1:42:013:0	“ Sir , ” they said , “ there are actually twelve of us . We , your servants , are all brothers , sons of a man living in the land of Canaan . Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now , and one of our brothers is no longer with us . ”
1:42:014:0	But Joseph insisted , “ As I said , you are spies !
1:42:015:0	This is how I will test your story . I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here !
1:42:016:0	One of you must go and get your brother . I 'll keep the rest of you here in prison . Then we 'll find out whether or not your story is true . By the life of Pharaoh , if it turns out that you do n't have a younger brother , then I 'll know you are spies . ”
1:42:017:0	So Joseph put them all in prison for three days .
1:42:018:0	On the third day Joseph said to them , “ I am a God-fearing man . If you do as I say , you will live .
1:42:019:0	If you really are honest men , choose one of your brothers to remain in prison . The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families .
1:42:020:0	But you must bring your youngest brother back to me . This will prove that you are telling the truth , and you will not die. ” To this they agreed .
1:42:021:0	Speaking among themselves , they said , “ Clearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago . We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life , but we would n't listen . That 's why we 're in this trouble . ”
1:42:022:0	“ Did n't I tell you not to sin against the boy ? ” Reuben asked . “ But you would n't listen . And now we have to answer for his blood ! ”
1:42:023:0	Of course , they did n't know that Joseph understood them , for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter .
1:42:024:0	Now he turned away from them and began to weep . When he regained his composure , he spoke to them again . Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes .
1:42:025:0	Joseph then ordered his servants to fill the men 's sacks with grain , but he also gave secret instructions to return each brother 's payment at the top of his sack . He also gave them supplies for their journey home .
1:42:026:0	So the brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain and headed for home .
1:42:027:0	But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey , he found his money in the top of his sack .
1:42:028:0	“ Look ! ” he exclaimed to his brothers . “ My money has been returned ; it 's here in my sack ! ” Then their hearts sank . Trembling , they said to each other , “ What has God done to us ? ”
1:42:029:0	When the brothers came to their father , Jacob , in the land of Canaan , they told him everything that had happened to them .
1:42:030:0	“ The man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us , ” they told him . “ He accused us of being spies scouting the land .
1:42:031:0	But we said , ‘ We are honest men , not spies .
1:42:032:0	We are twelve brothers , sons of one father . One brother is no longer with us , and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan . '
1:42:033:0	“ Then the man who is governor of the land told us , ‘ This is how I will find out if you are honest men . Leave one of your brothers here with me , and take grain for your starving families and go on home .
1:42:034:0	But you must bring your youngest brother back to me . Then I will know you are honest men and not spies . Then I will give you back your brother , and you may trade freely in the land . ' ”
1:42:035:0	As they emptied out their sacks , there in each man 's sack was the bag of money he had paid for the grain ! The brothers and their father were terrified when they saw the bags of money .
1:42:036:0	Jacob exclaimed , “ You are robbing me of my children ! Joseph is gone ! Simeon is gone ! And now you want to take Benjamin , too . Everything is going against me ! ”
1:42:037:0	Then Reuben said to his father , “ You may kill my two sons if I do n't bring Benjamin back to you . I 'll be responsible for him , and I promise to bring him back . ”
1:42:038:0	But Jacob replied , “ My son will not go down with you . His brother Joseph is dead , and he is all I have left . If anything should happen to him on your journey , you would send this grieving , white-haired man to his grave . ”
