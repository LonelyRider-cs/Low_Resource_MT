1:29:001:1	Jacob Arrives at Paddan-Aram
1:29:001:0	Then Jacob hurried on , finally arriving in the land of the east .
1:29:002:0	He saw a well in the distance . Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it , waiting to be watered . But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well .
1:29:003:0	It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals . Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well .
1:29:004:0	Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked , “ Where are you from , my friends ? ” “ We are from Haran , ” they answered .
1:29:005:0	“ Do you know a man there named Laban , the grandson of Nahor ? ” he asked. “ Yes , we do , ” they replied .
1:29:006:0	“ Is he doing well ? ” Jacob asked. “ Yes , he 's well , ” they answered . “ Look , here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now . ”
1:29:007:0	Jacob said , “ Look , it 's still broad daylight — too early to round up the animals . Why do n't you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture ? ”
1:29:008:0	“ We ca n't water the animals until all the flocks have arrived , ” they replied . “ Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well , and we water all the sheep and goats . ”
1:29:009:0	Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father 's flock , for she was a shepherd .
1:29:010:0	And because Rachel was his cousin — the daughter of Laban , his mother 's brother — and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban , Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle 's flock .
1:29:011:0	Then Jacob kissed Rachel , and he wept aloud .
1:29:012:0	He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father 's side — the son of her aunt Rebekah . So Rachel quickly ran and told her father , Laban .
1:29:013:0	As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived , he ran out to meet him . He embraced and kissed him and brought him home . When Jacob had told him his story ,
1:29:002:1	Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel
1:29:014:0	Laban exclaimed , “ You really are my own flesh and blood ! ” After Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month ,
1:29:015:0	Laban said to him , “ You should n't work for me without pay just because we are relatives . Tell me how much your wages should be . ”
1:29:016:0	Now Laban had two daughters . The older daughter was named Leah , and the younger one was Rachel .
1:29:017:0	There was no sparkle in Leah 's eyes , but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a lovely face .
1:29:018:0	Since Jacob was in love with Rachel , he told her father , “ I 'll work for you for seven years if you 'll give me Rachel , your younger daughter , as my wife . ”
1:29:019:0	“ Agreed ! ” Laban replied . “ I 'd rather give her to you than to anyone else . Stay and work with me . ”
1:29:020:0	So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel . But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days .
1:29:021:0	Finally , the time came for him to marry her . “ I have fulfilled my agreement , ” Jacob said to Laban . “ Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her . ”
1:29:022:0	So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast .
1:29:023:0	But that night , when it was dark , Laban took Leah to Jacob , and he slept with her .
1:29:024:0	( Laban had given Leah a servant , Zilpah , to be her maid . )
1:29:025:0	But when Jacob woke up in the morning — it was Leah ! “ What have you done to me ? ” Jacob raged at Laban . “ I worked seven years for Rachel ! Why have you tricked me ? ”
1:29:026:0	“ It 's not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn , ” Laban replied .
1:29:027:0	“ But wait until the bridal week is over ; then we 'll give you Rachel , too — provided you promise to work another seven years for me . ”
1:29:028:0	So Jacob agreed to work seven more years . A week after Jacob had married Leah , Laban gave him Rachel , too .
1:29:029:0	( Laban gave Rachel a servant , Bilhah , to be her maid . )
1:29:003:1	Jacob 's Many Children
1:29:030:0	So Jacob slept with Rachel , too , and he loved her much more than Leah . He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years .
1:29:031:0	When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved , he enabled her to have children , but Rachel could not conceive .
1:29:032:0	So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Reuben , for she said , “ The Lord has noticed my misery , and now my husband will love me . ”
1:29:033:0	She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son . She named him Simeon , for she said , “ The Lord heard that I was unloved and has given me another son . ”
1:29:034:0	Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son . He was named Levi , for she said , “ Surely this time my husband will feel affection for me , since I have given him three sons ! ”
1:29:035:0	Once again Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son . She named him Judah , for she said , “ Now I will praise the Lord ! ” And then she stopped having children .
