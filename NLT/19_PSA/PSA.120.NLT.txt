19:120:001:0	I took my troubles to the Lord ; I cried out to him , and he answered my prayer .
19:120:002:0	Rescue me , O Lord , from liarsand from all deceitful people .
19:120:003:0	O deceptive tongue , what will God do to you ? How will he increase your punishment ?
19:120:004:0	You will be pierced with sharp arrowsand burned with glowing coals .
19:120:005:0	How I suffer in far-off Meshech.It pains me to live in distant Kedar .
19:120:006:0	I am tired of livingamong people who hate peace .
19:120:007:0	I search for peace ; but when I speak of peace , they want war !
