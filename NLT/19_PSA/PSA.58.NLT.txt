19:58:001:0	Justice — do you rulers know the meaning of the word ? Do you judge the people fairly ?
19:58:002:0	No ! You plot injustice in your hearts.You spread violence throughout the land .
19:58:003:0	These wicked people are born sinners ; even from birth they have lied and gone their own way .
19:58:004:0	They spit venom like deadly snakes ; they are like cobras that refuse to listen ,
19:58:005:0	ignoring the tunes of the snake charmers , no matter how skillfully they play .
19:58:006:0	Break off their fangs , O God ! Smash the jaws of these lions , O Lord !
19:58:007:0	May they disappear like water into thirsty ground.Make their weapons useless in their hands .
19:58:008:0	May they be like snails that dissolve into slime , like a stillborn child who will never see the sun .
19:58:009:0	God will sweep them away , both young and old , faster than a pot heats over burning thorns .
19:58:010:0	The godly will rejoice when they see injustice avenged.They will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked .
19:58:011:0	Then at last everyone will say , “ There truly is a reward for those who live for God ; surely there is a God who judges justly here on earth . ”
