19:140:001:0	O Lord , rescue me from evil people.Protect me from those who are violent ,
19:140:002:0	those who plot evil in their heartsand stir up trouble all day long .
19:140:003:0	Their tongues sting like a snake ; the venom of a viper drips from their lips.Interlude
19:140:004:0	O Lord , keep me out of the hands of the wicked.Protect me from those who are violent , for they are plotting against me .
19:140:005:0	The proud have set a trap to catch me ; they have stretched out a net ; they have placed traps all along the way.Interlude
19:140:006:0	I said to the Lord , “ You are my God ! ” Listen , O Lord , to my cries for mercy !
19:140:007:0	O Sovereign Lord , the strong one who rescued me , you protected me on the day of battle .
19:140:008:0	Lord , do not let evil people have their way.Do not let their evil schemes succeed , or they will become proud.Interlude
19:140:009:0	Let my enemies be destroyedby the very evil they have planned for me .
19:140:010:0	Let burning coals fall down on their heads.Let them be thrown into the fireor into watery pits from which they ca n't escape .
19:140:011:0	Do n't let liars prosper here in our land.Cause great disasters to fall on the violent .
19:140:012:0	But I know the Lord will help those they persecute ; he will give justice to the poor .
19:140:013:0	Surely righteous people are praising your name ; the godly will live in your presence .
