19:28:001:0	I pray to you , O Lord , my rock.Do not turn a deaf ear to me.For if you are silent , I might as well give up and die .
19:28:002:0	Listen to my prayer for mercyas I cry out to you for help , as I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary .
19:28:003:0	Do not drag me away with the wicked — with those who do evil — those who speak friendly words to their neighborswhile planning evil in their hearts .
19:28:004:0	Give them the punishment they so richly deserve ! Measure it out in proportion to their wickedness.Pay them back for all their evil deeds ! Give them a taste of what they have done to others .
19:28:005:0	They care nothing for what the Lord has doneor for what his hands have made.So he will tear them down , and they will never be rebuilt !
19:28:006:0	Praise the Lord ! For he has heard my cry for mercy .
19:28:007:0	The Lord is my strength and shield.I trust him with all my heart.He helps me , and my heart is filled with joy.I burst out in songs of thanksgiving .
19:28:008:0	The Lord gives his people strength.He is a safe fortress for his anointed king .
19:28:009:0	Save your people ! Bless Israel , your special possession.Lead them like a shepherd , and carry them in your arms forever .
