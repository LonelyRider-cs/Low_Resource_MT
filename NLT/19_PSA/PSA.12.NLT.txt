19:12:001:0	Help , O Lord , for the godly are fast disappearing ! The faithful have vanished from the earth !
19:12:002:0	Neighbors lie to each other , speaking with flattering lips and deceitful hearts .
19:12:003:0	May the Lord cut off their flattering lipsand silence their boastful tongues .
19:12:004:0	They say , “ We will lie to our hearts ' content.Our lips are our own — who can stop us ? ”
19:12:005:0	The Lord replies , “ I have seen violence done to the helpless , and I have heard the groans of the poor.Now I will rise up to rescue them , as they have longed for me to do . ”
19:12:006:0	The Lord 's promises are pure , like silver refined in a furnace , purified seven times over .
19:12:007:0	Therefore , Lord , we know you will protect the oppressed , preserving them forever from this lying generation ,
19:12:008:0	even though the wicked strut about , and evil is praised throughout the land .
