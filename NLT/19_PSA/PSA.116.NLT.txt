19:116:001:0	I love the Lord because he hears my voiceand my prayer for mercy .
19:116:002:0	Because he bends down to listen , I will pray as long as I have breath !
19:116:003:0	Death wrapped its ropes around me ; the terrors of the grave overtook me.I saw only trouble and sorrow .
19:116:004:0	Then I called on the name of the Lord : “ Please , Lord , save me ! ”
19:116:005:0	How kind the Lord is ! How good he is ! So merciful , this God of ours !
19:116:006:0	The Lord protects those of childlike faith ; I was facing death , and he saved me .
19:116:007:0	Let my soul be at rest again , for the Lord has been good to me .
19:116:008:0	He has saved me from death , my eyes from tears , my feet from stumbling .
19:116:009:0	And so I walk in the Lord 's presenceas I live here on earth !
19:116:010:0	I believed in you , so I said , “ I am deeply troubled , Lord . ”
19:116:011:0	In my anxiety I cried out to you , “ These people are all liars ! ”
19:116:012:0	What can I offer the Lordfor all he has done for me ?
19:116:013:0	I will lift up the cup of salvationand praise the Lord 's name for saving me .
19:116:014:0	I will keep my promises to the Lordin the presence of all his people .
19:116:015:0	The Lord cares deeplywhen his loved ones die .
19:116:016:0	O Lord , I am your servant ; yes , I am your servant , born into your household ; you have freed me from my chains .
19:116:017:0	I will offer you a sacrifice of thanksgivingand call on the name of the Lord .
19:116:018:0	I will fulfill my vows to the Lordin the presence of all his people—
19:116:019:0	in the house of the Lordin the heart of Jerusalem.Praise the Lord !
