19:82:001:0	God presides over heaven 's court ; he pronounces judgment on the heavenly beings :
19:82:002:0	“ How long will you hand down unjust decisionsby favoring the wicked ? Interlude
19:82:003:0	“ Give justice to the poor and the orphan ; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute .
19:82:004:0	Rescue the poor and helpless ; deliver them from the grasp of evil people .
19:82:005:0	But these oppressors know nothing ; they are so ignorant ! They wander about in darkness , while the whole world is shaken to the core .
19:82:006:0	I say , ‘ You are gods ; you are all children of the Most High .
19:82:007:0	But you will die like mere mortalsand fall like every other ruler . ' ”
19:82:008:0	Rise up , O God , and judge the earth , for all the nations belong to you .
