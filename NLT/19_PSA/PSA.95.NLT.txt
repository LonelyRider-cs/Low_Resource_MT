19:95:001:0	Come , let us sing to the Lord ! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation .
19:95:002:0	Let us come to him with thanksgiving.Let us sing psalms of praise to him .
19:95:003:0	For the Lord is a great God , a great King above all gods .
19:95:004:0	He holds in his hands the depths of the earthand the mightiest mountains .
19:95:005:0	The sea belongs to him , for he made it.His hands formed the dry land , too .
19:95:006:0	Come , let us worship and bow down.Let us kneel before the Lord our maker ,
19:95:007:0	for he is our God.We are the people he watches over , the flock under his care.If only you would listen to his voice today !
19:95:008:0	The Lord says , “ Do n't harden your hearts as Israel did at Meribah , as they did at Massah in the wilderness .
19:95:009:0	For there your ancestors tested and tried my patience , even though they saw everything I did .
19:95:010:0	For forty years I was angry with them , and I said , ‘ They are a people whose hearts turn away from me.They refuse to do what I tell them . '
19:95:011:0	So in my anger I took an oath : ‘ They will never enter my place of rest . ' ”
