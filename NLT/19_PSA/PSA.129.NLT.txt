19:129:001:0	From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me.Let all Israel repeat this :
19:129:002:0	From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me , but they have never defeated me .
19:129:003:0	My back is covered with cuts , as if a farmer had plowed long furrows .
19:129:004:0	But the Lord is good ; he has cut me free from the ropes of the ungodly .
19:129:005:0	May all who hate Jerusalembe turned back in shameful defeat .
19:129:006:0	May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop , turning yellow when only half grown ,
19:129:007:0	ignored by the harvester , despised by the binder .
19:129:008:0	And may those who pass byrefuse to give them this blessing : “ The Lord bless you ; we bless you in the Lord 's name . ”
