19:11:001:0	I trust in the Lord for protection.So why do you say to me , “ Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety !
19:11:002:0	The wicked are stringing their bowsand fitting their arrows on the bowstrings.They shoot from the shadowsat those whose hearts are right .
19:11:003:0	The foundations of law and order have collapsed.What can the righteous do ? ”
19:11:004:0	But the Lord is in his holy Temple ; the Lord still rules from heaven.He watches everyone closely , examining every person on earth .
19:11:005:0	The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked.He hates those who love violence .
19:11:006:0	He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked , punishing them with scorching winds .
19:11:007:0	For the righteous Lord loves justice.The virtuous will see his face .
