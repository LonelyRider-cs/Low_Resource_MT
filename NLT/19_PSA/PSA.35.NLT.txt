19:35:001:0	O Lord , oppose those who oppose me.Fight those who fight against me .
19:35:002:0	Put on your armor , and take up your shield.Prepare for battle , and come to my aid .
19:35:003:0	Lift up your spear and javelinagainst those who pursue me.Let me hear you say , “ I will give you victory ! ”
19:35:004:0	Bring shame and disgrace on those trying to kill me ; turn them back and humiliate those who want to harm me .
19:35:005:0	Blow them away like chaff in the wind—a wind sent by the angel of the Lord .
19:35:006:0	Make their path dark and slippery , with the angel of the Lord pursuing them .
19:35:007:0	I did them no wrong , but they laid a trap for me.I did them no wrong , but they dug a pit to catch me .
19:35:008:0	So let sudden ruin come upon them ! Let them be caught in the trap they set for me ! Let them be destroyed in the pit they dug for me .
19:35:009:0	Then I will rejoice in the Lord.I will be glad because he rescues me .
19:35:010:0	With every bone in my body I will praise him : “ Lord , who can compare with you ? Who else rescues the helpless from the strong ? Who else protects the helpless and poor from those who rob them ? ”
19:35:011:0	Malicious witnesses testify against me.They accuse me of crimes I know nothing about .
19:35:012:0	They repay me evil for good.I am sick with despair .
19:35:013:0	Yet when they were ill , I grieved for them.I denied myself by fasting for them , but my prayers returned unanswered .
19:35:014:0	I was sad , as though they were my friends or family , as if I were grieving for my own mother .
19:35:015:0	But they are glad now that I am in trouble ; they gleefully join together against me.I am attacked by people I do n't even know ; they slander me constantly .
19:35:016:0	They mock me and call me names ; they snarl at me .
19:35:017:0	How long , O Lord , will you look on and do nothing ? Rescue me from their fierce attacks.Protect my life from these lions !
19:35:018:0	Then I will thank you in front of the great assembly.I will praise you before all the people .
19:35:019:0	Do n't let my treacherous enemies rejoice over my defeat.Do n't let those who hate me without cause gloat over my sorrow .
19:35:020:0	They do n't talk of peace ; they plot against innocent people who mind their own business .
19:35:021:0	They shout , “ Aha ! Aha ! With our own eyes we saw him do it ! ”
19:35:022:0	O Lord , you know all about this.Do not stay silent.Do not abandon me now , O Lord .
19:35:023:0	Wake up ! Rise to my defense ! Take up my case , my God and my Lord .
19:35:024:0	Declare me not guilty , O Lord my God , for you give justice.Do n't let my enemies laugh about me in my troubles .
19:35:025:0	Do n't let them say , “ Look , we got what we wanted ! Now we will eat him alive ! ”
19:35:026:0	May those who rejoice at my troublesbe humiliated and disgraced.May those who triumph over mebe covered with shame and dishonor .
19:35:027:0	But give great joy to those who came to my defense.Let them continually say , “ Great is the Lord , who delights in blessing his servant with peace ! ”
19:35:028:0	Then I will proclaim your justice , and I will praise you all day long .
