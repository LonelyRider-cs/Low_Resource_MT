19:59:001:0	Rescue me from my enemies , O God.Protect me from those who have come to destroy me .
19:59:002:0	Rescue me from these criminals ; save me from these murderers .
19:59:003:0	They have set an ambush for me.Fierce enemies are out there waiting , Lord , though I have not sinned or offended them .
19:59:004:0	I have done nothing wrong , yet they prepare to attack me.Wake up ! See what is happening and help me !
19:59:005:0	O Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , wake up and punish those hostile nations.Show no mercy to wicked traitors.Interlude
19:59:006:0	They come out at night , snarling like vicious dogsas they prowl the streets .
19:59:007:0	Listen to the filth that comes from their mouths ; their words cut like swords. “ After all , who can hear us ? ” they sneer .
19:59:008:0	But Lord , you laugh at them.You scoff at all the hostile nations .
19:59:009:0	You are my strength ; I wait for you to rescue me , for you , O God , are my fortress .
19:59:010:0	In his unfailing love , my God will stand with me.He will let me look down in triumph on all my enemies .
19:59:011:0	Do n't kill them , for my people soon forget such lessons ; stagger them with your power , and bring them to their knees , O Lord our shield .
19:59:012:0	Because of the sinful things they say , because of the evil that is on their lips , let them be captured by their pride , their curses , and their lies .
19:59:013:0	Destroy them in your anger ! Wipe them out completely ! Then the whole world will knowthat God reigns in Israel.Interlude
19:59:014:0	My enemies come out at night , snarling like vicious dogsas they prowl the streets .
19:59:015:0	They scavenge for foodbut go to sleep unsatisfied .
19:59:016:0	But as for me , I will sing about your power.Each morning I will sing with joy about your unfailing love.For you have been my refuge , a place of safety when I am in distress .
19:59:017:0	O my Strength , to you I sing praises , for you , O God , are my refuge , the God who shows me unfailing love .
