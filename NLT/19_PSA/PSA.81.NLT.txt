19:81:001:0	Sing praises to God , our strength.Sing to the God of Jacob .
19:81:002:0	Sing ! Beat the tambourine.Play the sweet lyre and the harp .
19:81:003:0	Blow the ram 's horn at new moon , and again at full moon to call a festival !
19:81:004:0	For this is required by the decrees of Israel ; it is a regulation of the God of Jacob .
19:81:005:0	He made it a law for Israelwhen he attacked Egypt to set us free.I heard an unknown voice say ,
19:81:006:0	“ Now I will take the load from your shoulders ; I will free your hands from their heavy tasks .
19:81:007:0	You cried to me in trouble , and I saved you ; I answered out of the thundercloudand tested your faith when there was no water at Meribah.Interlude
19:81:008:0	“ Listen to me , O my people , while I give you stern warnings.O Israel , if you would only listen to me !
19:81:009:0	You must never have a foreign god ; you must not bow down before a false god .
19:81:010:0	For it was I , the Lord your God , who rescued you from the land of Egypt.Open your mouth wide , and I will fill it with good things .
19:81:011:0	“ But no , my people would n't listen.Israel did not want me around .
19:81:012:0	So I let them follow their own stubborn desires , living according to their own ideas .
19:81:013:0	Oh , that my people would listen to me ! Oh , that Israel would follow me , walking in my paths !
19:81:014:0	How quickly I would then subdue their enemies ! How soon my hands would be upon their foes !
19:81:015:0	Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him ; they would be doomed forever .
19:81:016:0	But I would feed you with the finest wheat.I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock . ”
