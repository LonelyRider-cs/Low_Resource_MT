19:139:001:0	O Lord , you have examined my heartand know everything about me .
19:139:002:0	You know when I sit down or stand up.You know my thoughts even when I 'm far away .
19:139:003:0	You see me when I traveland when I rest at home.You know everything I do .
19:139:004:0	You know what I am going to sayeven before I say it , Lord .
19:139:005:0	You go before me and follow me.You place your hand of blessing on my head .
19:139:006:0	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me , too great for me to understand !
19:139:007:0	I can never escape from your Spirit ! I can never get away from your presence !
19:139:008:0	If I go up to heaven , you are there ; if I go down to the grave , you are there .
19:139:009:0	If I ride the wings of the morning , if I dwell by the farthest oceans ,
19:139:010:0	even there your hand will guide me , and your strength will support me .
19:139:011:0	I could ask the darkness to hide meand the light around me to become night —
19:139:012:0	but even in darkness I can not hide from you.To you the night shines as bright as day.Darkness and light are the same to you .
19:139:013:0	You made all the delicate , inner parts of my bodyand knit me together in my mother 's womb .
19:139:014:0	Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex ! Your workmanship is marvelous — how well I know it .
19:139:015:0	You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion , as I was woven together in the dark of the womb .
19:139:016:0	You saw me before I was born.Every day of my life was recorded in your book.Every moment was laid outbefore a single day had passed .
19:139:017:0	How precious are your thoughts about me , O God.They can not be numbered !
19:139:018:0	I ca n't even count them ; they outnumber the grains of sand ! And when I wake up , you are still with me !
19:139:019:0	O God , if only you would destroy the wicked ! Get out of my life , you murderers !
19:139:020:0	They blaspheme you ; your enemies misuse your name .
19:139:021:0	O Lord , should n't I hate those who hate you ? Should n't I despise those who oppose you ?
19:139:022:0	Yes , I hate them with total hatred , for your enemies are my enemies .
19:139:023:0	Search me , O God , and know my heart ; test me and know my anxious thoughts .
19:139:024:0	Point out anything in me that offends you , and lead me along the path of everlasting life .
