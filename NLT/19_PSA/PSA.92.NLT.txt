19:92:001:0	It is good to give thanks to the Lord , to sing praises to the Most High .
19:92:002:0	It is good to proclaim your unfailing love in the morning , your faithfulness in the evening ,
19:92:003:0	accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument , a harp , and the melody of a lyre .
19:92:004:0	You thrill me , Lord , with all you have done for me ! I sing for joy because of what you have done .
19:92:005:0	O Lord , what great works you do ! And how deep are your thoughts .
19:92:006:0	Only a simpleton would not know , and only a fool would not understand this :
19:92:007:0	Though the wicked sprout like weedsand evildoers flourish , they will be destroyed forever .
19:92:008:0	But you , O Lord , will be exalted forever .
19:92:009:0	Your enemies , Lord , will surely perish ; all evildoers will be scattered .
19:92:010:0	But you have made me as strong as a wild ox.You have anointed me with the finest oil .
19:92:011:0	My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies ; my ears have heard the defeat of my wicked opponents .
19:92:012:0	But the godly will flourish like palm treesand grow strong like the cedars of Lebanon .
19:92:013:0	For they are transplanted to the Lord 's own house.They flourish in the courts of our God .
19:92:014:0	Even in old age they will still produce fruit ; they will remain vital and green .
19:92:015:0	They will declare , “ The Lord is just ! He is my rock ! There is no evil in him ! ”
