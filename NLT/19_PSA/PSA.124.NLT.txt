19:124:001:0	What if the Lord had not been on our side ? Let all Israel repeat :
19:124:002:0	What if the Lord had not been on our sidewhen people attacked us ?
19:124:003:0	They would have swallowed us alivein their burning anger .
19:124:004:0	The waters would have engulfed us ; a torrent would have overwhelmed us .
19:124:005:0	Yes , the raging waters of their furywould have overwhelmed our very lives .
19:124:006:0	Praise the Lord , who did not let their teeth tear us apart !
19:124:007:0	We escaped like a bird from a hunter 's trap.The trap is broken , and we are free !
19:124:008:0	Our help is from the Lord , who made heaven and earth .
