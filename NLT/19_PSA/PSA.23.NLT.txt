19:23:001:0	The Lord is my shepherd ; I have all that I need .
19:23:002:0	He lets me rest in green meadows ; he leads me beside peaceful streams .
19:23:003:0	He renews my strength.He guides me along right paths , bringing honor to his name .
19:23:004:0	Even when I walkthrough the darkest valley , I will not be afraid , for you are close beside me.Your rod and your staffprotect and comfort me .
19:23:005:0	You prepare a feast for mein the presence of my enemies.You honor me by anointing my head with oil.My cup overflows with blessings .
19:23:006:0	Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue meall the days of my life , and I will live in the house of the Lordforever .
