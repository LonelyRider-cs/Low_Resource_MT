19:77:001:0	I cry out to God ; yes , I shout.Oh , that God would listen to me !
19:77:002:0	When I was in deep trouble , I searched for the Lord.All night long I prayed , with hands lifted toward heaven , but my soul was not comforted .
19:77:003:0	I think of God , and I moan , overwhelmed with longing for his help.Interlude
19:77:004:0	You do n't let me sleep.I am too distressed even to pray !
19:77:005:0	I think of the good old days , long since ended ,
19:77:006:0	when my nights were filled with joyful songs.I search my soul and ponder the difference now .
19:77:007:0	Has the Lord rejected me forever ? Will he never again be kind to me ?
19:77:008:0	Is his unfailing love gone forever ? Have his promises permanently failed ?
19:77:009:0	Has God forgotten to be gracious ? Has he slammed the door on his compassion ? Interlude
19:77:010:0	And I said , “ This is my fate ; the Most High has turned his hand against me . ”
19:77:011:0	But then I recall all you have done , O Lord ; I remember your wonderful deeds of long ago .
19:77:012:0	They are constantly in my thoughts.I can not stop thinking about your mighty works .
19:77:013:0	O God , your ways are holy.Is there any god as mighty as you ?
19:77:014:0	You are the God of great wonders ! You demonstrate your awesome power among the nations .
19:77:015:0	By your strong arm , you redeemed your people , the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.Interlude
19:77:016:0	When the Red Sea saw you , O God , its waters looked and trembled ! The sea quaked to its very depths .
19:77:017:0	The clouds poured down rain ; the thunder rumbled in the sky.Your arrows of lightning flashed .
19:77:018:0	Your thunder roared from the whirlwind ; the lightning lit up the world ! The earth trembled and shook .
19:77:019:0	Your road led through the sea , your pathway through the mighty waters — a pathway no one knew was there !
19:77:020:0	You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep , with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds .
