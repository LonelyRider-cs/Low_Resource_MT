19:106:001:0	Praise the Lord ! Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good ! His faithful love endures forever .
19:106:002:0	Who can list the glorious miracles of the Lord ? Who can ever praise him enough ?
19:106:003:0	There is joy for those who deal justly with othersand always do what is right .
19:106:004:0	Remember me , Lord , when you show favor to your people ; come near and rescue me .
19:106:005:0	Let me share in the prosperity of your chosen ones.Let me rejoice in the joy of your people ; let me praise you with those who are your heritage .
19:106:006:0	Like our ancestors , we have sinned.We have done wrong ! We have acted wickedly !
19:106:007:0	Our ancestors in Egyptwere not impressed by the Lord 's miraculous deeds.They soon forgot his many acts of kindness to them.Instead , they rebelled against him at the Red Sea .
19:106:008:0	Even so , he saved them—to defend the honor of his nameand to demonstrate his mighty power .
19:106:009:0	He commanded the Red Sea to dry up.He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert .
19:106:010:0	So he rescued them from their enemiesand redeemed them from their foes .
19:106:011:0	Then the water returned and covered their enemies ; not one of them survived .
19:106:012:0	Then his people believed his promises.Then they sang his praise .
19:106:013:0	Yet how quickly they forgot what he had done ! They would n't wait for his counsel !
19:106:014:0	In the wilderness their desires ran wild , testing God 's patience in that dry wasteland .
19:106:015:0	So he gave them what they asked for , but he sent a plague along with it .
19:106:016:0	The people in the camp were jealous of Mosesand envious of Aaron , the Lord 's holy priest .
19:106:017:0	Because of this , the earth opened up ; it swallowed Dathanand buried Abiram and the other rebels .
19:106:018:0	Fire fell upon their followers ; a flame consumed the wicked .
19:106:019:0	The people made a calf at Mount Sinai ; they bowed before an image made of gold .
19:106:020:0	They traded their glorious Godfor a statue of a grass-eating bull .
19:106:021:0	They forgot God , their savior , who had done such great things in Egypt—
19:106:022:0	such wonderful things in the land of Ham , such awesome deeds at the Red Sea .
19:106:023:0	So he declared he would destroy them.But Moses , his chosen one , stepped between the Lord and the people.He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them .
19:106:024:0	The people refused to enter the pleasant land , for they would n't believe his promise to care for them .
19:106:025:0	Instead , they grumbled in their tentsand refused to obey the Lord .
19:106:026:0	Therefore , he solemnly sworethat he would kill them in the wilderness ,
19:106:027:0	that he would scatter their descendants among the nations , exiling them to distant lands .
19:106:028:0	Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor ; they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead !
19:106:029:0	They angered the Lord with all these things , so a plague broke out among them .
19:106:030:0	But Phinehas had the courage to intervene , and the plague was stopped .
19:106:031:0	So he has been regarded as a righteous manever since that time .
19:106:032:0	At Meribah , too , they angered the Lord , causing Moses serious trouble .
19:106:033:0	They made Moses angry , and he spoke foolishly .
19:106:034:0	Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land , as the Lord had commanded them .
19:106:035:0	Instead , they mingled among the pagansand adopted their evil customs .
19:106:036:0	They worshiped their idols , which led to their downfall .
19:106:037:0	They even sacrificed their sonsand their daughters to the demons .
19:106:038:0	They shed innocent blood , the blood of their sons and daughters.By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan , they polluted the land with murder .
19:106:039:0	They defiled themselves by their evil deeds , and their love of idols was adultery in the Lord 's sight .
19:106:040:0	That is why the Lord 's anger burned against his people , and he abhorred his own special possession .
19:106:041:0	He handed them over to pagan nations , and they were ruled by those who hated them .
19:106:042:0	Their enemies crushed themand brought them under their cruel power .
19:106:043:0	Again and again he rescued them , but they chose to rebel against him , and they were finally destroyed by their sin .
19:106:044:0	Even so , he pitied them in their distressand listened to their cries .
19:106:045:0	He remembered his covenant with themand relented because of his unfailing love .
19:106:046:0	He even caused their captorsto treat them with kindness .
19:106:047:0	Save us , O Lord our God ! Gather us back from among the nations , so we can thank your holy nameand rejoice and praise you .
19:106:048:0	Praise the Lord , the God of Israel , who lives from everlasting to everlasting ! Let all the people say , “ Amen ! ” Praise the Lord !
