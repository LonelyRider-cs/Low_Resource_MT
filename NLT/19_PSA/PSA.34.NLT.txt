19:34:001:0	I will praise the Lord at all times.I will constantly speak his praises .
19:34:002:0	I will boast only in the Lord ; let all who are helpless take heart .
19:34:003:0	Come , let us tell of the Lord 's greatness ; let us exalt his name together .
19:34:004:0	I prayed to the Lord , and he answered me.He freed me from all my fears .
19:34:005:0	Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy ; no shadow of shame will darken their faces .
19:34:006:0	In my desperation I prayed , and the Lord listened ; he saved me from all my troubles .
19:34:007:0	For the angel of the Lord is a guard ; he surrounds and defends all who fear him .
19:34:008:0	Taste and see that the Lord is good.Oh , the joys of those who take refuge in him !
19:34:009:0	Fear the Lord , you his godly people , for those who fear him will have all they need .
19:34:010:0	Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry , but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing .
19:34:011:0	Come , my children , and listen to me , and I will teach you to fear the Lord .
19:34:012:0	Does anyone want to live a lifethat is long and prosperous ?
19:34:013:0	Then keep your tongue from speaking eviland your lips from telling lies !
19:34:014:0	Turn away from evil and do good.Search for peace , and work to maintain it .
19:34:015:0	The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right ; his ears are open to their cries for help .
19:34:016:0	But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil ; he will erase their memory from the earth .
19:34:017:0	The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.He rescues them from all their troubles .
19:34:018:0	The Lord is close to the brokenhearted ; he rescues those whose spirits are crushed .
19:34:019:0	The righteous person faces many troubles , but the Lord comes to the rescue each time .
19:34:020:0	For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous ; not one of them is broken !
19:34:021:0	Calamity will surely destroy the wicked , and those who hate the righteous will be punished .
19:34:022:0	But the Lord will redeem those who serve him.No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned .
