19:123:001:0	I lift my eyes to you , O God , enthroned in heaven .
19:123:002:0	We keep looking to the Lord our God for his mercy , just as servants keep their eyes on their master , as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal .
19:123:003:0	Have mercy on us , Lord , have mercy , for we have had our fill of contempt .
19:123:004:0	We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proudand the contempt of the arrogant .
