19:105:001:0	Give thanks to the Lord and proclaim his greatness.Let the whole world know what he has done .
19:105:002:0	Sing to him ; yes , sing his praises.Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds .
19:105:003:0	Exult in his holy name ; rejoice , you who worship the Lord .
19:105:004:0	Search for the Lord and for his strength ; continually seek him .
19:105:005:0	Remember the wonders he has performed , his miracles , and the rulings he has given ,
19:105:006:0	you children of his servant Abraham , you descendants of Jacob , his chosen ones .
19:105:007:0	He is the Lord our God.His justice is seen throughout the land .
19:105:008:0	He always stands by his covenant—the commitment he made to a thousand generations .
19:105:009:0	This is the covenant he made with Abrahamand the oath he swore to Isaac .
19:105:010:0	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree , and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant :
19:105:011:0	“ I will give you the land of Canaanas your special possession . ”
19:105:012:0	He said this when they were few in number , a tiny group of strangers in Canaan .
19:105:013:0	They wandered from nation to nation , from one kingdom to another .
19:105:014:0	Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.He warned kings on their behalf :
19:105:015:0	“ Do not touch my chosen people , and do not hurt my prophets . ”
19:105:016:0	He called for a famine on the land of Canaan , cutting off its food supply .
19:105:017:0	Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them—Joseph , who was sold as a slave .
19:105:018:0	They bruised his feet with fettersand placed his neck in an iron collar .
19:105:019:0	Until the time came to fulfill his dreams , the Lord tested Joseph 's character .
19:105:020:0	Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free ; the ruler of the nation opened his prison door .
19:105:021:0	Joseph was put in charge of all the king 's household ; he became ruler over all the king 's possessions .
19:105:022:0	He could instruct the king 's aides as he pleasedand teach the king 's advisers .
19:105:023:0	Then Israel arrived in Egypt ; Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham .
19:105:024:0	And the Lord multiplied the people of Israeluntil they became too mighty for their enemies .
19:105:025:0	Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites , and they plotted against the Lord 's servants .
19:105:026:0	But the Lord sent his servant Moses , along with Aaron , whom he had chosen .
19:105:027:0	They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians , and wonders in the land of Ham .
19:105:028:0	The Lord blanketed Egypt in darkness , for they had defied his commands to let his people go .
19:105:029:0	He turned their water into blood , poisoning all the fish .
19:105:030:0	Then frogs overran the landand even invaded the king 's bedrooms .
19:105:031:0	When the Lord spoke , flies descended on the Egyptians , and gnats swarmed across Egypt .
19:105:032:0	He sent them hail instead of rain , and lightning flashed over the land .
19:105:033:0	He ruined their grapevines and fig treesand shattered all the trees .
19:105:034:0	He spoke , and hordes of locusts came—young locusts beyond number .
19:105:035:0	They ate up everything green in the land , destroying all the crops in their fields .
19:105:036:0	Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home , the pride and joy of each family .
19:105:037:0	The Lord brought his people out of Egypt , loaded with silver and gold ; and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled .
19:105:038:0	Egypt was glad when they were gone , for they feared them greatly .
19:105:039:0	The Lord spread a cloud above them as a coveringand gave them a great fire to light the darkness .
19:105:040:0	They asked for meat , and he sent them quail ; he satisfied their hunger with manna—bread from heaven .
19:105:041:0	He split open a rock , and water gushed outto form a river through the dry wasteland .
19:105:042:0	For he remembered his sacred promiseto his servant Abraham .
19:105:043:0	So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy , his chosen ones with rejoicing .
19:105:044:0	He gave his people the lands of pagan nations , and they harvested crops that others had planted .
19:105:045:0	All this happened so they would follow his decreesand obey his instructions.Praise the Lord !
