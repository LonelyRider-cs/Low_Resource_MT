19:40:001:0	I waited patiently for the Lord to help me , and he turned to me and heard my cry .
19:40:002:0	He lifted me out of the pit of despair , out of the mud and the mire.He set my feet on solid groundand steadied me as I walked along .
19:40:003:0	He has given me a new song to sing , a hymn of praise to our God.Many will see what he has done and be amazed.They will put their trust in the Lord .
19:40:004:0	Oh , the joys of those who trust the Lord , who have no confidence in the proudor in those who worship idols .
19:40:005:0	O Lord my God , you have performed many wonders for us.Your plans for us are too numerous to list.You have no equal.If I tried to recite all your wonderful deeds , I would never come to the end of them .
19:40:006:0	You take no delight in sacrifices or offerings.Now that you have made me listen , I finally understand—you do n't require burnt offerings or sin offerings .
19:40:007:0	Then I said , “ Look , I have come.As is written about me in the Scriptures :
19:40:008:0	I take joy in doing your will , my God , for your instructions are written on my heart . ”
19:40:009:0	I have told all your people about your justice.I have not been afraid to speak out , as you , O Lord , well know .
19:40:010:0	I have not kept the good news of your justice hidden in my heart ; I have talked about your faithfulness and saving power.I have told everyone in the great assemblyof your unfailing love and faithfulness .
19:40:011:0	Lord , do n't hold back your tender mercies from me.Let your unfailing love and faithfulness always protect me .
19:40:012:0	For troubles surround me—too many to count ! My sins pile up so highI ca n't see my way out.They outnumber the hairs on my head.I have lost all courage .
19:40:013:0	Please , Lord , rescue me ! Come quickly , Lord , and help me .
19:40:014:0	May those who try to destroy mebe humiliated and put to shame.May those who take delight in my troublebe turned back in disgrace .
19:40:015:0	Let them be horrified by their shame , for they said , “ Aha ! We 've got him now ! ”
19:40:016:0	But may all who search for yoube filled with joy and gladness in you.May those who love your salvationrepeatedly shout , “ The Lord is great ! ”
19:40:017:0	As for me , since I am poor and needy , let the Lord keep me in his thoughts.You are my helper and my savior.O my God , do not delay .
