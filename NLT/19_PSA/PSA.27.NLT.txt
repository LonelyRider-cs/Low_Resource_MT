19:27:001:0	The Lord is my light and my salvation — so why should I be afraid ? The Lord is my fortress , protecting me from danger , so why should I tremble ?
19:27:002:0	When evil people come to devour me , when my enemies and foes attack me , they will stumble and fall .
19:27:003:0	Though a mighty army surrounds me , my heart will not be afraid.Even if I am attacked , I will remain confident .
19:27:004:0	The one thing I ask of the Lord — the thing I seek most — is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life , delighting in the Lord 's perfectionsand meditating in his Temple .
19:27:005:0	For he will conceal me there when troubles come ; he will hide me in his sanctuary.He will place me out of reach on a high rock .
19:27:006:0	Then I will hold my head highabove my enemies who surround me.At his sanctuary I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy , singing and praising the Lord with music .
19:27:007:0	Hear me as I pray , O Lord.Be merciful and answer me !
19:27:008:0	My heart has heard you say , “ Come and talk with me. ” And my heart responds , “ Lord , I am coming . ”
19:27:009:0	Do not turn your back on me.Do not reject your servant in anger.You have always been my helper.Do n't leave me now ; do n't abandon me , O God of my salvation !
19:27:010:0	Even if my father and mother abandon me , the Lord will hold me close .
19:27:011:0	Teach me how to live , O Lord.Lead me along the right path , for my enemies are waiting for me .
19:27:012:0	Do not let me fall into their hands.For they accuse me of things I 've never done ; with every breath they threaten me with violence .
19:27:013:0	Yet I am confident I will see the Lord 's goodnesswhile I am here in the land of the living .
19:27:014:0	Wait patiently for the Lord.Be brave and courageous.Yes , wait patiently for the Lord .
