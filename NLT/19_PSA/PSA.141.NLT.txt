19:141:001:0	O Lord , I am calling to you . Please hurry ! Listen when I cry to you for help !
19:141:002:0	Accept my prayer as incense offered to you , and my upraised hands as an evening offering .
19:141:003:0	Take control of what I say , O Lord , and guard my lips .
19:141:004:0	Do n't let me drift toward evilor take part in acts of wickedness.Do n't let me share in the delicaciesof those who do wrong .
19:141:005:0	Let the godly strike me ! It will be a kindness ! If they correct me , it is soothing medicine.Do n't let me refuse it.But I pray constantlyagainst the wicked and their deeds .
19:141:006:0	When their leaders are thrown down from a cliff , the wicked will listen to my words and find them true .
19:141:007:0	Like rocks brought up by a plow , the bones of the wicked will lie scattered without burial .
19:141:008:0	I look to you for help , O Sovereign Lord.You are my refuge ; do n't let them kill me .
19:141:009:0	Keep me from the traps they have set for me , from the snares of those who do wrong .
19:141:010:0	Let the wicked fall into their own nets , but let me escape .
