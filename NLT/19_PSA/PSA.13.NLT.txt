19:13:001:0	O Lord , how long will you forget me ? Forever ? How long will you look the other way ?
19:13:002:0	How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul , with sorrow in my heart every day ? How long will my enemy have the upper hand ?
19:13:003:0	Turn and answer me , O Lord my God ! Restore the sparkle to my eyes , or I will die .
19:13:004:0	Do n't let my enemies gloat , saying , “ We have defeated him ! ” Do n't let them rejoice at my downfall .
19:13:005:0	But I trust in your unfailing love.I will rejoice because you have rescued me .
19:13:006:0	I will sing to the Lordbecause he is good to me .
