19:69:001:0	Save me , O God , for the floodwaters are up to my neck .
19:69:002:0	Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire ; I ca n't find a foothold.I am in deep water , and the floods overwhelm me .
19:69:003:0	I am exhausted from crying for help ; my throat is parched.My eyes are swollen with weeping , waiting for my God to help me .
19:69:004:0	Those who hate me without causeoutnumber the hairs on my head.Many enemies try to destroy me with lies , demanding that I give back what I did n't steal .
19:69:005:0	O God , you know how foolish I am ; my sins can not be hidden from you .
19:69:006:0	Do n't let those who trust in you be ashamed because of me , O Sovereign Lord of Heaven 's Armies.Do n't let me cause them to be humiliated , O God of Israel .
19:69:007:0	For I endure insults for your sake ; humiliation is written all over my face .
19:69:008:0	Even my own brothers pretend they do n't know me ; they treat me like a stranger .
19:69:009:0	Passion for your house has consumed me , and the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me .
19:69:010:0	When I weep and fast , they scoff at me .
19:69:011:0	When I dress in burlap to show sorrow , they make fun of me .
19:69:012:0	I am the favorite topic of town gossip , and all the drunks sing about me .
19:69:013:0	But I keep praying to you , Lord , hoping this time you will show me favor.In your unfailing love , O God , answer my prayer with your sure salvation .
19:69:014:0	Rescue me from the mud ; do n't let me sink any deeper ! Save me from those who hate me , and pull me from these deep waters .
19:69:015:0	Do n't let the floods overwhelm me , or the deep waters swallow me , or the pit of death devour me .
19:69:016:0	Answer my prayers , O Lord , for your unfailing love is wonderful.Take care of me , for your mercy is so plentiful .
19:69:017:0	Do n't hide from your servant ; answer me quickly , for I am in deep trouble !
19:69:018:0	Come and redeem me ; free me from my enemies .
19:69:019:0	You know of my shame , scorn , and disgrace.You see all that my enemies are doing .
19:69:020:0	Their insults have broken my heart , and I am in despair.If only one person would show some pity ; if only one would turn and comfort me .
19:69:021:0	But instead , they give me poison for food ; they offer me sour wine for my thirst .
19:69:022:0	Let the bountiful table set before them become a snareand their prosperity become a trap .
19:69:023:0	Let their eyes go blind so they can not see , and make their bodies shake continually .
19:69:024:0	Pour out your fury on them ; consume them with your burning anger .
19:69:025:0	Let their homes become desolateand their tents be deserted .
19:69:026:0	To the one you have punished , they add insult to injury ; they add to the pain of those you have hurt .
19:69:027:0	Pile their sins up high , and do n't let them go free .
19:69:028:0	Erase their names from the Book of Life ; do n't let them be counted among the righteous .
19:69:029:0	I am suffering and in pain.Rescue me , O God , by your saving power .
19:69:030:0	Then I will praise God 's name with singing , and I will honor him with thanksgiving .
19:69:031:0	For this will please the Lord more than sacrificing cattle , more than presenting a bull with its horns and hooves .
19:69:032:0	The humble will see their God at work and be glad.Let all who seek God 's help be encouraged .
19:69:033:0	For the Lord hears the cries of the needy ; he does not despise his imprisoned people .
19:69:034:0	Praise him , O heaven and earth , the seas and all that move in them .
19:69:035:0	For God will save Jerusalemand rebuild the towns of Judah.His people will live thereand settle in their own land .
19:69:036:0	The descendants of those who obey him will inherit the land , and those who love him will live there in safety .
