19:146:001:0	Praise the Lord ! Let all that I am praise the Lord .
19:146:002:0	I will praise the Lord as long as I live.I will sing praises to my God with my dying breath .
19:146:003:0	Do n't put your confidence in powerful people ; there is no help for you there .
19:146:004:0	When they breathe their last , they return to the earth , and all their plans die with them .
19:146:005:0	But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper , whose hope is in the Lord their God .
19:146:006:0	He made heaven and earth , the sea , and everything in them.He keeps every promise forever .
19:146:007:0	He gives justice to the oppressedand food to the hungry.The Lord frees the prisoners .
19:146:008:0	The Lord opens the eyes of the blind.The Lord lifts up those who are weighed down.The Lord loves the godly .
19:146:009:0	The Lord protects the foreigners among us.He cares for the orphans and widows , but he frustrates the plans of the wicked .
19:146:010:0	The Lord will reign forever.He will be your God , O Jerusalem , throughout the generations.Praise the Lord !
