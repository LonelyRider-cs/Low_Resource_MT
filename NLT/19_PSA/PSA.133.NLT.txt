19:133:001:0	How wonderful and pleasant it iswhen brothers live together in harmony !
19:133:002:0	For harmony is as precious as the anointing oilthat was poured over Aaron 's head , that ran down his beardand onto the border of his robe .
19:133:003:0	Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermonthat falls on the mountains of Zion.And there the Lord has pronounced his blessing , even life everlasting .
