19:147:001:0	Praise the Lord ! How good to sing praises to our God ! How delightful and how fitting !
19:147:002:0	The Lord is rebuilding Jerusalemand bringing the exiles back to Israel .
19:147:003:0	He heals the brokenheartedand bandages their wounds .
19:147:004:0	He counts the starsand calls them all by name .
19:147:005:0	How great is our Lord ! His power is absolute ! His understanding is beyond comprehension !
19:147:006:0	The Lord supports the humble , but he brings the wicked down into the dust .
19:147:007:0	Sing out your thanks to the Lord ; sing praises to our God with a harp .
19:147:008:0	He covers the heavens with clouds , provides rain for the earth , and makes the grass grow in mountain pastures .
19:147:009:0	He gives food to the wild animalsand feeds the young ravens when they cry .
19:147:010:0	He takes no pleasure in the strength of a horseor in human might .
19:147:011:0	No , the Lord 's delight is in those who fear him , those who put their hope in his unfailing love .
19:147:012:0	Glorify the Lord , O Jerusalem ! Praise your God , O Zion !
19:147:013:0	For he has strengthened the bars of your gatesand blessed your children within your walls .
19:147:014:0	He sends peace across your nationand satisfies your hunger with the finest wheat .
19:147:015:0	He sends his orders to the world â€” how swiftly his word flies !
19:147:016:0	He sends the snow like white wool ; he scatters frost upon the ground like ashes .
19:147:017:0	He hurls the hail like stones.Who can stand against his freezing cold ?
19:147:018:0	Then , at his command , it all melts.He sends his winds , and the ice thaws .
19:147:019:0	He has revealed his words to Jacob , his decrees and regulations to Israel .
19:147:020:0	He has not done this for any other nation ; they do not know his regulations.Praise the Lord !
