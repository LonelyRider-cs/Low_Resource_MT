19:102:001:0	Lord , hear my prayer ! Listen to my plea !
19:102:002:0	Do n't turn away from mein my time of distress.Bend down to listen , and answer me quickly when I call to you .
19:102:003:0	For my days disappear like smoke , and my bones burn like red-hot coals .
19:102:004:0	My heart is sick , withered like grass , and I have lost my appetite .
19:102:005:0	Because of my groaning , I am reduced to skin and bones .
19:102:006:0	I am like an owl in the desert , like a little owl in a far-off wilderness .
19:102:007:0	I lie awake , lonely as a solitary bird on the roof .
19:102:008:0	My enemies taunt me day after day.They mock and curse me .
19:102:009:0	I eat ashes for food.My tears run down into my drink
19:102:010:0	because of your anger and wrath.For you have picked me up and thrown me out .
19:102:011:0	My life passes as swiftly as the evening shadows.I am withering away like grass .
19:102:012:0	But you , O Lord , will sit on your throne forever.Your fame will endure to every generation .
19:102:013:0	You will arise and have mercy on Jerusalem — and now is the time to pity her , now is the time you promised to help .
19:102:014:0	For your people love every stone in her wallsand cherish even the dust in her streets .
19:102:015:0	Then the nations will tremble before the Lord.The kings of the earth will tremble before his glory .
19:102:016:0	For the Lord will rebuild Jerusalem.He will appear in his glory .
19:102:017:0	He will listen to the prayers of the destitute.He will not reject their pleas .
19:102:018:0	Let this be recorded for future generations , so that a people not yet born will praise the Lord .
19:102:019:0	Tell them the Lord looked downfrom his heavenly sanctuary.He looked down to earth from heaven
19:102:020:0	to hear the groans of the prisoners , to release those condemned to die .
19:102:021:0	And so the Lord 's fame will be celebrated in Zion , his praises in Jerusalem ,
19:102:022:0	when multitudes gather togetherand kingdoms come to worship the Lord .
19:102:023:0	He broke my strength in midlife , cutting short my days .
19:102:024:0	But I cried to him , “ O my God , who lives forever , do n't take my life while I am so young !
19:102:025:0	Long ago you laid the foundation of the earthand made the heavens with your hands .
19:102:026:0	They will perish , but you remain forever ; they will wear out like old clothing.You will change them like a garmentand discard them .
19:102:027:0	But you are always the same ; you will live forever .
19:102:028:0	The children of your peoplewill live in security.Their children 's childrenwill thrive in your presence . ”
