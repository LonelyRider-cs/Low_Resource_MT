19:39:001:0	I said to myself , “ I will watch what I doand not sin in what I say.I will hold my tonguewhen the ungodly are around me . ”
19:39:002:0	But as I stood there in silence — not even speaking of good things — the turmoil within me grew worse .
19:39:003:0	The more I thought about it , the hotter I got , igniting a fire of words :
19:39:004:0	“ Lord , remind me how brief my time on earth will be.Remind me that my days are numbered — how fleeting my life is .
19:39:005:0	You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand.My entire lifetime is just a moment to you ; at best , each of us is but a breath. ” Interlude
19:39:006:0	We are merely moving shadows , and all our busy rushing ends in nothing.We heap up wealth , not knowing who will spend it .
19:39:007:0	And so , Lord , where do I put my hope ? My only hope is in you .
19:39:008:0	Rescue me from my rebellion.Do not let fools mock me .
19:39:009:0	I am silent before you ; I wo n't say a word , for my punishment is from you .
19:39:010:0	But please stop striking me ! I am exhausted by the blows from your hand .
19:39:011:0	When you discipline us for our sins , you consume like a moth what is precious to us.Each of us is but a breath.Interlude
19:39:012:0	Hear my prayer , O Lord ! Listen to my cries for help ! Do n't ignore my tears.For I am your guest — a traveler passing through , as my ancestors were before me .
19:39:013:0	Leave me alone so I can smile againbefore I am gone and exist no more .
