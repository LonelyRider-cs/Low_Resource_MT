19:94:001:0	O Lord , the God of vengeance , O God of vengeance , let your glorious justice shine forth !
19:94:002:0	Arise , O Judge of the earth.Give the proud what they deserve .
19:94:003:0	How long , O Lord ? How long will the wicked be allowed to gloat ?
19:94:004:0	How long will they speak with arrogance ? How long will these evil people boast ?
19:94:005:0	They crush your people , Lord , hurting those you claim as your own .
19:94:006:0	They kill widows and foreignersand murder orphans .
19:94:007:0	“ The Lord is n't looking , ” they say , “ and besides , the God of Israel does n't care . ”
19:94:008:0	Think again , you fools ! When will you finally catch on ?
19:94:009:0	Is he deaf — the one who made your ears ? Is he blind — the one who formed your eyes ?
19:94:010:0	He punishes the nations — wo n't he also punish you ? He knows everything — does n't he also know what you are doing ?
19:94:011:0	The Lord knows people 's thoughts ; he knows they are worthless !
19:94:012:0	Joyful are those you discipline , Lord , those you teach with your instructions .
19:94:013:0	You give them relief from troubled timesuntil a pit is dug to capture the wicked .
19:94:014:0	The Lord will not reject his people ; he will not abandon his special possession .
19:94:015:0	Judgment will again be founded on justice , and those with virtuous hearts will pursue it .
19:94:016:0	Who will protect me from the wicked ? Who will stand up for me against evildoers ?
19:94:017:0	Unless the Lord had helped me , I would soon have settled in the silence of the grave .
19:94:018:0	I cried out , “ I am slipping ! ” but your unfailing love , O Lord , supported me .
19:94:019:0	When doubts filled my mind , your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer .
19:94:020:0	Can unjust leaders claim that God is on their side — leaders whose decrees permit injustice ?
19:94:021:0	They gang up against the righteousand condemn the innocent to death .
19:94:022:0	But the Lord is my fortress ; my God is the mighty rock where I hide .
19:94:023:0	God will turn the sins of evil people back on them.He will destroy them for their sins.The Lord our God will destroy them .
