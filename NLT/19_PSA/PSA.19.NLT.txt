19:19:001:0	The heavens proclaim the glory of God.The skies display his craftsmanship .
19:19:002:0	Day after day they continue to speak ; night after night they make him known .
19:19:003:0	They speak without a sound or word ; their voice is never heard .
19:19:004:0	Yet their message has gone throughout the earth , and their words to all the world.God has made a home in the heavens for the sun .
19:19:005:0	It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding.It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race .
19:19:006:0	The sun rises at one end of the heavensand follows its course to the other end.Nothing can hide from its heat .
19:19:007:0	The instructions of the Lord are perfect , reviving the soul.The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy , making wise the simple .
19:19:008:0	The commandments of the Lord are right , bringing joy to the heart.The commands of the Lord are clear , giving insight for living .
19:19:009:0	Reverence for the Lord is pure , lasting forever.The laws of the Lord are true ; each one is fair .
19:19:010:0	They are more desirable than gold , even the finest gold.They are sweeter than honey , even honey dripping from the comb .
19:19:011:0	They are a warning to your servant , a great reward for those who obey them .
19:19:012:0	How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart ? Cleanse me from these hidden faults .
19:19:013:0	Keep your servant from deliberate sins ! Do n't let them control me.Then I will be free of guiltand innocent of great sin .
19:19:014:0	May the words of my mouthand the meditation of my heartbe pleasing to you , O Lord , my rock and my redeemer .
