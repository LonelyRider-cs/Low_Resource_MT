19:42:001:1	Book Two
19:42:002:1	( Psalms 42–72 )
19:42:001:0	As the deer longs for streams of water , so I long for you , O God .
19:42:002:0	I thirst for God , the living God.When can I go and stand before him ?
19:42:003:0	Day and night I have only tears for food , while my enemies continually taunt me , saying , “ Where is this God of yours ? ”
19:42:004:0	My heart is breakingas I remember how it used to be : I walked among the crowds of worshipers , leading a great procession to the house of God , singing for joy and giving thanksamid the sound of a great celebration !
19:42:005:0	Why am I discouraged ? Why is my heart so sad ? I will put my hope in God ! I will praise him again—my Savior and
19:42:006:0	my God ! Now I am deeply discouraged , but I will remember you—even from distant Mount Hermon , the source of the Jordan , from the land of Mount Mizar .
19:42:007:0	I hear the tumult of the raging seasas your waves and surging tides sweep over me .
19:42:008:0	But each day the Lord pours his unfailing love upon me , and through each night I sing his songs , praying to God who gives me life .
19:42:009:0	“ O God my rock , ” I cry , “ Why have you forgotten me ? Why must I wander around in grief , oppressed by my enemies ? ”
19:42:010:0	Their taunts break my bones.They scoff , “ Where is this God of yours ? ”
19:42:011:0	Why am I discouraged ? Why is my heart so sad ? I will put my hope in God ! I will praise him again—my Savior and my God !
