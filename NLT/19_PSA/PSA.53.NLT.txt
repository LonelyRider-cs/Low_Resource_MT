19:53:001:0	Only fools say in their hearts , “ There is no God. ” They are corrupt , and their actions are evil ; not one of them does good !
19:53:002:0	God looks down from heavenon the entire human race ; he looks to see if anyone is truly wise , if anyone seeks God .
19:53:003:0	But no , all have turned away ; all have become corrupt.No one does good , not a single one !
19:53:004:0	Will those who do evil never learn ? They eat up my people like breadand would n't think of praying to God .
19:53:005:0	Terror will grip them , terror like they have never known before.God will scatter the bones of your enemies.You will put them to shame , for God has rejected them .
19:53:006:0	Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel ? When God restores his people , Jacob will shout with joy , and Israel will rejoice .
