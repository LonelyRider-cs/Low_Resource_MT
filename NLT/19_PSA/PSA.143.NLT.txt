19:143:001:0	Hear my prayer , O Lord ; listen to my plea ! Answer me because you are faithful and righteous .
19:143:002:0	Do n't put your servant on trial , for no one is innocent before you .
19:143:003:0	My enemy has chased me.He has knocked me to the groundand forces me to live in darkness like those in the grave .
19:143:004:0	I am losing all hope ; I am paralyzed with fear .
19:143:005:0	I remember the days of old.I ponder all your great worksand think about what you have done .
19:143:006:0	I lift my hands to you in prayer.I thirst for you as parched land thirsts for rain.Interlude
19:143:007:0	Come quickly , Lord , and answer me , for my depression deepens.Do n't turn away from me , or I will die .
19:143:008:0	Let me hear of your unfailing love each morning , for I am trusting you.Show me where to walk , for I give myself to you .
19:143:009:0	Rescue me from my enemies , Lord ; I run to you to hide me .
19:143:010:0	Teach me to do your will , for you are my God.May your gracious Spirit lead me forwardon a firm footing .
19:143:011:0	For the glory of your name , O Lord , preserve my life.Because of your faithfulness , bring me out of this distress .
19:143:012:0	In your unfailing love , silence all my enemiesand destroy all my foes , for I am your servant .
