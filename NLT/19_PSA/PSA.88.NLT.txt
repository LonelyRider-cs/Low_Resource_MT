19:88:001:0	O Lord , God of my salvation , I cry out to you by day.I come to you at night .
19:88:002:0	Now hear my prayer ; listen to my cry .
19:88:003:0	For my life is full of troubles , and death draws near .
19:88:004:0	I am as good as dead , like a strong man with no strength left .
19:88:005:0	They have left me among the dead , and I lie like a corpse in a grave.I am forgotten , cut off from your care .
19:88:006:0	You have thrown me into the lowest pit , into the darkest depths .
19:88:007:0	Your anger weighs me down ; with wave after wave you have engulfed me.Interlude
19:88:008:0	You have driven my friends awayby making me repulsive to them.I am in a trap with no way of escape .
19:88:009:0	My eyes are blinded by my tears.Each day I beg for your help , O Lord ; I lift my hands to you for mercy .
19:88:010:0	Are your wonderful deeds of any use to the dead ? Do the dead rise up and praise you ? Interlude
19:88:011:0	Can those in the grave declare your unfailing love ? Can they proclaim your faithfulness in the place of destruction ?
19:88:012:0	Can the darkness speak of your wonderful deeds ? Can anyone in the land of forgetfulness talk about your righteousness ?
19:88:013:0	O Lord , I cry out to you.I will keep on pleading day by day .
19:88:014:0	O Lord , why do you reject me ? Why do you turn your face from me ?
19:88:015:0	I have been sick and close to death since my youth.I stand helpless and desperate before your terrors .
19:88:016:0	Your fierce anger has overwhelmed me.Your terrors have paralyzed me .
19:88:017:0	They swirl around me like floodwaters all day long.They have engulfed me completely .
19:88:018:0	You have taken away my companions and loved ones.Darkness is my closest friend .
