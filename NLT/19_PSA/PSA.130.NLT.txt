19:130:001:0	From the depths of despair , O Lord , I call for your help .
19:130:002:0	Hear my cry , O Lord.Pay attention to my prayer .
19:130:003:0	Lord , if you kept a record of our sins , who , O Lord , could ever survive ?
19:130:004:0	But you offer forgiveness , that we might learn to fear you .
19:130:005:0	I am counting on the Lord ; yes , I am counting on him.I have put my hope in his word .
19:130:006:0	I long for the Lordmore than sentries long for the dawn , yes , more than sentries long for the dawn .
