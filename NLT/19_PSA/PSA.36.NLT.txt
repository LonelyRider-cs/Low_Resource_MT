19:36:001:0	Sin whispers to the wicked , deep within their hearts.They have no fear of God at all .
19:36:002:0	In their blind conceit , they can not see how wicked they really are .
19:36:003:0	Everything they say is crooked and deceitful.They refuse to act wisely or do good .
19:36:004:0	They lie awake at night , hatching sinful plots.Their actions are never good.They make no attempt to turn from evil .
19:36:005:0	Your unfailing love , O Lord , is as vast as the heavens ; your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds .
19:36:006:0	Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains , your justice like the ocean depths.You care for people and animals alike , O Lord .
19:36:007:0	How precious is your unfailing love , O God ! All humanity finds shelterin the shadow of your wings .
19:36:008:0	You feed them from the abundance of your own house , letting them drink from your river of delights .
19:36:009:0	For you are the fountain of life , the light by which we see .
19:36:010:0	Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you ; give justice to those with honest hearts .
19:36:011:0	Do n't let the proud trample meor the wicked push me around .
19:36:012:0	Look ! Those who do evil have fallen ! They are thrown down , never to rise again .
