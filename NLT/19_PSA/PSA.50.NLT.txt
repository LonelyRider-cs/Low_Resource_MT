19:50:001:0	The Lord , the Mighty One , is God , and he has spoken ; he has summoned all humanityfrom where the sun rises to where it sets .
19:50:002:0	From Mount Zion , the perfection of beauty , God shines in glorious radiance .
19:50:003:0	Our God approaches , and he is not silent.Fire devours everything in his way , and a great storm rages around him .
19:50:004:0	He calls on the heavens above and earth belowto witness the judgment of his people .
19:50:005:0	“ Bring my faithful people to me — those who made a covenant with me by giving sacrifices . ”
19:50:006:0	Then let the heavens proclaim his justice , for God himself will be the judge.Interlude
19:50:007:0	“ O my people , listen as I speak.Here are my charges against you , O Israel : I am God , your God !
19:50:008:0	I have no complaint about your sacrificesor the burnt offerings you constantly offer .
19:50:009:0	But I do not need the bulls from your barnsor the goats from your pens .
19:50:010:0	For all the animals of the forest are mine , and I own the cattle on a thousand hills .
19:50:011:0	I know every bird on the mountains , and all the animals of the field are mine .
19:50:012:0	If I were hungry , I would not tell you , for all the world is mine and everything in it .
19:50:013:0	Do I eat the meat of bulls ? Do I drink the blood of goats ?
19:50:014:0	Make thankfulness your sacrifice to God , and keep the vows you made to the Most High .
19:50:015:0	Then call on me when you are in trouble , and I will rescue you , and you will give me glory . ”
19:50:016:0	But God says to the wicked : “ Why bother reciting my decreesand pretending to obey my covenant ?
19:50:017:0	For you refuse my disciplineand treat my words like trash .
19:50:018:0	When you see thieves , you approve of them , and you spend your time with adulterers .
19:50:019:0	Your mouth is filled with wickedness , and your tongue is full of lies .
19:50:020:0	You sit around and slander your brother — your own mother 's son .
19:50:021:0	While you did all this , I remained silent , and you thought I did n't care.But now I will rebuke you , listing all my charges against you .
19:50:022:0	Repent , all of you who forget me , or I will tear you apart , and no one will help you .
19:50:023:0	But giving thanks is a sacrifice that truly honors me.If you keep to my path , I will reveal to you the salvation of God . ”
