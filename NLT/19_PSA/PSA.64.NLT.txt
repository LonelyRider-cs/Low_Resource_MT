19:64:001:0	O God , listen to my complaint.Protect my life from my enemies ' threats .
19:64:002:0	Hide me from the plots of this evil mob , from this gang of wrongdoers .
19:64:003:0	They sharpen their tongues like swordsand aim their bitter words like arrows .
19:64:004:0	They shoot from ambush at the innocent , attacking suddenly and fearlessly .
19:64:005:0	They encourage each other to do eviland plan how to set their traps in secret. “ Who will ever notice ? ” they ask .
19:64:006:0	As they plot their crimes , they say , “ We have devised the perfect plan ! ” Yes , the human heart and mind are cunning .
19:64:007:0	But God himself will shoot them with his arrows , suddenly striking them down .
19:64:008:0	Their own tongues will ruin them , and all who see them will shake their heads in scorn .
19:64:009:0	Then everyone will be afraid ; they will proclaim the mighty acts of Godand realize all the amazing things he does .
19:64:010:0	The godly will rejoice in the Lordand find shelter in him.And those who do what is rightwill praise him .
