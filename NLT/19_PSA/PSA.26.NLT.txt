19:26:001:0	Declare me innocent , O Lord , for I have acted with integrity ; I have trusted in the Lord without wavering .
19:26:002:0	Put me on trial , Lord , and cross-examine me.Test my motives and my heart .
19:26:003:0	For I am always aware of your unfailing love , and I have lived according to your truth .
19:26:004:0	I do not spend time with liarsor go along with hypocrites .
19:26:005:0	I hate the gatherings of those who do evil , and I refuse to join in with the wicked .
19:26:006:0	I wash my hands to declare my innocence.I come to your altar , O Lord ,
19:26:007:0	singing a song of thanksgivingand telling of all your wonders .
19:26:008:0	I love your sanctuary , Lord , the place where your glorious presence dwells .
19:26:009:0	Do n't let me suffer the fate of sinners.Do n't condemn me along with murderers .
19:26:010:0	Their hands are dirty with evil schemes , and they constantly take bribes .
19:26:011:0	But I am not like that ; I live with integrity.So redeem me and show me mercy .
19:26:012:0	Now I stand on solid ground , and I will publicly praise the Lord .
