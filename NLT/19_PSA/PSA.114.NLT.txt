19:114:001:0	When the Israelites escaped from Egypt — when the family of Jacob left that foreign land —
19:114:002:0	the land of Judah became God 's sanctuary , and Israel became his kingdom .
19:114:003:0	The Red Sea saw them coming and hurried out of their way ! The water of the Jordan River turned away .
19:114:004:0	The mountains skipped like rams , the hills like lambs !
19:114:005:0	What 's wrong , Red Sea , that made you hurry out of their way ? What happened , Jordan River , that you turned away ?
19:114:006:0	Why , mountains , did you skip like rams ? Why , hills , like lambs ?
19:114:007:0	Tremble , O earth , at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the God of Jacob .
19:114:008:0	He turned the rock into a pool of water ; yes , a spring of water flowed from solid rock .
