19:73:001:1	Book Three
19:73:002:1	( Psalms 73–89 )
19:73:001:0	Truly God is good to Israel , to those whose hearts are pure .
19:73:002:0	But as for me , I almost lost my footing.My feet were slipping , and I was almost gone .
19:73:003:0	For I envied the proudwhen I saw them prosper despite their wickedness .
19:73:004:0	They seem to live such painless lives ; their bodies are so healthy and strong .
19:73:005:0	They do n't have troubles like other people ; they 're not plagued with problems like everyone else .
19:73:006:0	They wear pride like a jeweled necklaceand clothe themselves with cruelty .
19:73:007:0	These fat cats have everythingtheir hearts could ever wish for !
19:73:008:0	They scoff and speak only evil ; in their pride they seek to crush others .
19:73:009:0	They boast against the very heavens , and their words strut throughout the earth .
19:73:010:0	And so the people are dismayed and confused , drinking in all their words .
19:73:011:0	“ What does God know ? ” they ask. “ Does the Most High even know what 's happening ? ”
19:73:012:0	Look at these wicked people — enjoying a life of ease while their riches multiply .
19:73:013:0	Did I keep my heart pure for nothing ? Did I keep myself innocent for no reason ?
19:73:014:0	I get nothing but trouble all day long ; every morning brings me pain .
19:73:015:0	If I had really spoken this way to others , I would have been a traitor to your people .
19:73:016:0	So I tried to understand why the wicked prosper.But what a difficult task it is !
19:73:017:0	Then I went into your sanctuary , O God , and I finally understood the destiny of the wicked .
19:73:018:0	Truly , you put them on a slippery pathand send them sliding over the cliff to destruction .
19:73:019:0	In an instant they are destroyed , completely swept away by terrors .
19:73:020:0	When you arise , O Lord , you will laugh at their silly ideasas a person laughs at dreams in the morning .
19:73:021:0	Then I realized that my heart was bitter , and I was all torn up inside .
19:73:022:0	I was so foolish and ignorant — I must have seemed like a senseless animal to you .
19:73:023:0	Yet I still belong to you ; you hold my right hand .
19:73:024:0	You guide me with your counsel , leading me to a glorious destiny .
19:73:025:0	Whom have I in heaven but you ? I desire you more than anything on earth .
19:73:026:0	My health may fail , and my spirit may grow weak , but God remains the strength of my heart ; he is mine forever .
19:73:027:0	Those who desert him will perish , for you destroy those who abandon you .
19:73:028:0	But as for me , how good it is to be near God ! I have made the Sovereign Lord my shelter , and I will tell everyone about the wonderful things you do .
