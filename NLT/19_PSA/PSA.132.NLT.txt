19:132:001:0	Lord , remember Davidand all that he suffered .
19:132:002:0	He made a solemn promise to the Lord.He vowed to the Mighty One of Israel ,
19:132:003:0	“ I will not go home ; I will not let myself rest .
19:132:004:0	I will not let my eyes sleepnor close my eyelids in slumber
19:132:005:0	until I find a place to build a house for the Lord , a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel . ”
19:132:006:0	We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah ; then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar .
19:132:007:0	Let us go to the sanctuary of the Lord ; let us worship at the footstool of his throne .
19:132:008:0	Arise , O Lord , and enter your resting place , along with the Ark , the symbol of your power .
19:132:009:0	May your priests be clothed in godliness ; may your loyal servants sing for joy .
19:132:010:0	For the sake of your servant David , do not reject the king you have anointed .
19:132:011:0	The Lord swore an oath to Davidwith a promise he will never take back : “ I will place one of your descendantson your throne .
19:132:012:0	If your descendants obey the terms of my covenantand the laws that I teach them , then your royal linewill continue forever and ever . ”
19:132:013:0	For the Lord has chosen Jerusalem ; he has desired it for his home .
19:132:014:0	“ This is my resting place forever , ” he said. “ I will live here , for this is the home I desired .
19:132:015:0	I will bless this city and make it prosperous ; I will satisfy its poor with food .
19:132:016:0	I will clothe its priests with godliness ; its faithful servants will sing for joy .
19:132:017:0	Here I will increase the power of David ; my anointed one will be a light for my people .
19:132:018:0	I will clothe his enemies with shame , but he will be a glorious king . ”
