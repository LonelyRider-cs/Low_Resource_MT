19:125:001:0	Those who trust in the Lord are as secure as Mount Zion ; they will not be defeated but will endure forever .
19:125:002:0	Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem , so the Lord surrounds his people , both now and forever .
19:125:003:0	The wicked will not rule the land of the godly , for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong .
19:125:004:0	O Lord , do good to those who are good , whose hearts are in tune with you .
19:125:005:0	But banish those who turn to crooked ways , O Lord.Take them away with those who do evil.May Israel have peace !
