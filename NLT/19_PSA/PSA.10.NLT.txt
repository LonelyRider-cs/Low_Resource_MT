19:10:001:0	O Lord , why do you stand so far away ? Why do you hide when I am in trouble ?
19:10:002:0	The wicked arrogantly hunt down the poor.Let them be caught in the evil they plan for others .
19:10:003:0	For they brag about their evil desires ; they praise the greedy and curse the Lord .
19:10:004:0	The wicked are too proud to seek God.They seem to think that God is dead .
19:10:005:0	Yet they succeed in everything they do.They do not see your punishment awaiting them.They sneer at all their enemies .
19:10:006:0	They think , “ Nothing bad will ever happen to us ! We will be free of trouble forever ! ”
19:10:007:0	Their mouths are full of cursing , lies , and threats.Trouble and evil are on the tips of their tongues .
19:10:008:0	They lurk in ambush in the villages , waiting to murder innocent people.They are always searching for helpless victims .
19:10:009:0	Like lions crouched in hiding , they wait to pounce on the helpless.Like hunters they capture the helplessand drag them away in nets .
19:10:010:0	Their helpless victims are crushed ; they fall beneath the strength of the wicked .
19:10:011:0	The wicked think , “ God is n't watching us ! He has closed his eyes and wo n't even see what we do ! ”
19:10:012:0	Arise , O Lord ! Punish the wicked , O God ! Do not ignore the helpless !
19:10:013:0	Why do the wicked get away with despising God ? They think , “ God will never call us to account . ”
19:10:014:0	But you see the trouble and grief they cause.You take note of it and punish them.The helpless put their trust in you.You defend the orphans .
19:10:015:0	Break the arms of these wicked , evil people ! Go after them until the last one is destroyed .
19:10:016:0	The Lord is king forever and ever ! The godless nations will vanish from the land .
19:10:017:0	Lord , you know the hopes of the helpless.Surely you will hear their cries and comfort them .
19:10:018:0	You will bring justice to the orphans and the oppressed , so mere people can no longer terrify them .
