19:74:001:0	O God , why have you rejected us so long ? Why is your anger so intense against the sheep of your own pasture ?
19:74:002:0	Remember that we are the people you chose long ago , the tribe you redeemed as your own special possession ! And remember Jerusalem , your home here on earth .
19:74:003:0	Walk through the awful ruins of the city ; see how the enemy has destroyed your sanctuary .
19:74:004:0	There your enemies shouted their victorious battle cries ; there they set up their battle standards .
19:74:005:0	They swung their axeslike woodcutters in a forest .
19:74:006:0	With axes and picks , they smashed the carved paneling .
19:74:007:0	They burned your sanctuary to the ground.They defiled the place that bears your name .
19:74:008:0	Then they thought , “ Let 's destroy everything ! ” So they burned down all the places where God was worshiped .
19:74:009:0	We no longer see your miraculous signs.All the prophets are gone , and no one can tell us when it will end .
19:74:010:0	How long , O God , will you allow our enemies to insult you ? Will you let them dishonor your name forever ?
19:74:011:0	Why do you hold back your strong right hand ? Unleash your powerful fist and destroy them .
19:74:012:0	You , O God , are my king from ages past , bringing salvation to the earth .
19:74:013:0	You split the sea by your strengthand smashed the heads of the sea monsters .
19:74:014:0	You crushed the heads of Leviathanand let the desert animals eat him .
19:74:015:0	You caused the springs and streams to gush forth , and you dried up rivers that never run dry .
19:74:016:0	Both day and night belong to you ; you made the starlight and the sun .
19:74:017:0	You set the boundaries of the earth , and you made both summer and winter .
19:74:018:0	See how these enemies insult you , Lord.A foolish nation has dishonored your name .
19:74:019:0	Do n't let these wild beasts destroy your turtledoves.Do n't forget your suffering people forever .
19:74:020:0	Remember your covenant promises , for the land is full of darkness and violence !
19:74:021:0	Do n't let the downtrodden be humiliated again.Instead , let the poor and needy praise your name .
19:74:022:0	Arise , O God , and defend your cause.Remember how these fools insult you all day long .
19:74:023:0	Do n't overlook what your enemies have saidor their growing uproar .
