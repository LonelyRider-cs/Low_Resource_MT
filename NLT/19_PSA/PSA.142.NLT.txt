19:142:001:0	I cry out to the Lord ; I plead for the Lord 's mercy .
19:142:002:0	I pour out my complaints before himand tell him all my troubles .
19:142:003:0	When I am overwhelmed , you alone know the way I should turn.Wherever I go , my enemies have set traps for me .
19:142:004:0	I look for someone to come and help me , but no one gives me a passing thought ! No one will help me ; no one cares a bit what happens to me .
19:142:005:0	Then I pray to you , O Lord.I say , “ You are my place of refuge.You are all I really want in life .
19:142:006:0	Hear my cry , for I am very low.Rescue me from my persecutors , for they are too strong for me .
19:142:007:0	Bring me out of prisonso I can thank you.The godly will crowd around me , for you are good to me . ”
