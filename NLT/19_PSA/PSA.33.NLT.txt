19:33:001:0	Let the godly sing for joy to the Lord ; it is fitting for the pure to praise him .
19:33:002:0	Praise the Lord with melodies on the lyre ; make music for him on the ten-stringed harp .
19:33:003:0	Sing a new song of praise to him ; play skillfully on the harp , and sing with joy .
19:33:004:0	For the word of the Lord holds true , and we can trust everything he does .
19:33:005:0	He loves whatever is just and good ; the unfailing love of the Lord fills the earth .
19:33:006:0	The Lord merely spoke , and the heavens were created.He breathed the word , and all the stars were born .
19:33:007:0	He assigned the sea its boundariesand locked the oceans in vast reservoirs .
19:33:008:0	Let the whole world fear the Lord , and let everyone stand in awe of him .
19:33:009:0	For when he spoke , the world began ! It appeared at his command .
19:33:010:0	The Lord frustrates the plans of the nationsand thwarts all their schemes .
19:33:011:0	But the Lord 's plans stand firm forever ; his intentions can never be shaken .
19:33:012:0	What joy for the nation whose God is the Lord , whose people he has chosen as his inheritance .
19:33:013:0	The Lord looks down from heavenand sees the whole human race .
19:33:014:0	From his throne he observesall who live on the earth .
19:33:015:0	He made their hearts , so he understands everything they do .
19:33:016:0	The best-equipped army can not save a king , nor is great strength enough to save a warrior .
19:33:017:0	Do n't count on your warhorse to give you victory â€” for all its strength , it can not save you .
19:33:018:0	But the Lord watches over those who fear him , those who rely on his unfailing love .
19:33:019:0	He rescues them from deathand keeps them alive in times of famine .
19:33:020:0	We put our hope in the Lord.He is our help and our shield .
19:33:021:0	In him our hearts rejoice , for we trust in his holy name .
19:33:022:0	Let your unfailing love surround us , Lord , for our hope is in you alone .
