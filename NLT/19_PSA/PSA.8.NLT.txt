19:8:001:0	O Lord , our Lord , your majestic name fills the earth ! Your glory is higher than the heavens .
19:8:002:0	You have taught children and infantsto tell of your strength , silencing your enemiesand all who oppose you .
19:8:003:0	When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers — the moon and the stars you set in place —
19:8:004:0	what are mere mortals that you should think about them , human beings that you should care for them ?
19:8:005:0	Yet you made them only a little lower than Godand crowned them with glory and honor .
19:8:006:0	You gave them charge of everything you made , putting all things under their authority —
19:8:007:0	the flocks and the herdsand all the wild animals ,
19:8:008:0	the birds in the sky , the fish in the sea , and everything that swims the ocean currents .
19:8:009:0	O Lord , our Lord , your majestic name fills the earth !
