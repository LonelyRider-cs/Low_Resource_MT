19:15:001:0	Who may worship in your sanctuary , Lord ? Who may enter your presence on your holy hill ?
19:15:002:0	Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right , speaking the truth from sincere hearts .
19:15:003:0	Those who refuse to gossipor harm their neighborsor speak evil of their friends .
19:15:004:0	Those who despise flagrant sinners , and honor the faithful followers of the Lord , and keep their promises even when it hurts .
19:15:005:0	Those who lend money without charging interest , and who can not be bribed to lie about the innocent.Such people will stand firm forever .
