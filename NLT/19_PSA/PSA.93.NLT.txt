19:93:001:0	The Lord is king ! He is robed in majesty.Indeed , the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength.The world stands firmand can not be shaken .
19:93:002:0	Your throne , O Lord , has stood from time immemorial.You yourself are from the everlasting past .
19:93:003:0	The floods have risen up , O Lord.The floods have roared like thunder ; the floods have lifted their pounding waves .
19:93:004:0	But mightier than the violent raging of the seas , mightier than the breakers on the shore â€” the Lord above is mightier than these !
19:93:005:0	Your royal laws can not be changed.Your reign , O Lord , is holy forever and ever .
