19:2:001:0	Why are the nations so angry ? Why do they waste their time with futile plans ?
19:2:002:0	The kings of the earth prepare for battle ; the rulers plot togetheragainst the Lordand against his anointed one .
19:2:003:0	“ Let us break their chains , ” they cry , “ and free ourselves from slavery to God . ”
19:2:004:0	But the one who rules in heaven laughs.The Lord scoffs at them .
19:2:005:0	Then in anger he rebukes them , terrifying them with his fierce fury .
19:2:006:0	For the Lord declares , “ I have placed my chosen king on the thronein Jerusalem , on my holy mountain . ”
19:2:007:0	The king proclaims the Lord 's decree : “ The Lord said to me , ‘ You are my son.Today I have become your Father .
19:2:008:0	Only ask , and I will give you the nations as your inheritance , the whole earth as your possession .
19:2:009:0	You will break them with an iron rodand smash them like clay pots . ' ”
19:2:010:0	Now then , you kings , act wisely ! Be warned , you rulers of the earth !
19:2:011:0	Serve the Lord with reverent fear , and rejoice with trembling .
19:2:012:0	Submit to God 's royal son , or he will become angry , and you will be destroyed in the midst of all your activities—for his anger flares up in an instant.But what joy for all who take refuge in him !
