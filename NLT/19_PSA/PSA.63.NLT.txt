19:63:001:0	O God , you are my God ; I earnestly search for you.My soul thirsts for you ; my whole body longs for youin this parched and weary landwhere there is no water .
19:63:002:0	I have seen you in your sanctuaryand gazed upon your power and glory .
19:63:003:0	Your unfailing love is better than life itself ; how I praise you !
19:63:004:0	I will praise you as long as I live , lifting up my hands to you in prayer .
19:63:005:0	You satisfy me more than the richest feast.I will praise you with songs of joy .
19:63:006:0	I lie awake thinking of you , meditating on you through the night .
19:63:007:0	Because you are my helper , I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings .
19:63:008:0	I cling to you ; your strong right hand holds me securely .
19:63:009:0	But those plotting to destroy me will come to ruin.They will go down into the depths of the earth .
19:63:010:0	They will die by the swordand become the food of jackals .
19:63:011:0	But the king will rejoice in God.All who swear to tell the truth will praise him , while liars will be silenced .
