19:7:001:0	I come to you for protection , O Lord my God.Save me from my persecutors â€” rescue me !
19:7:002:0	If you do n't , they will maul me like a lion , tearing me to pieces with no one to rescue me .
19:7:003:0	O Lord my God , if I have done wrongor am guilty of injustice ,
19:7:004:0	if I have betrayed a friendor plundered my enemy without cause ,
19:7:005:0	then let my enemies capture me.Let them trample me into the groundand drag my honor in the dust.Interlude
19:7:006:0	Arise , O Lord , in anger ! Stand up against the fury of my enemies ! Wake up , my God , and bring justice !
19:7:007:0	Gather the nations before you.Rule over them from on high .
19:7:008:0	The Lord judges the nations.Declare me righteous , O Lord , for I am innocent , O Most High !
19:7:009:0	End the evil of those who are wicked , and defend the righteous.For you look deep within the mind and heart , O righteous God .
19:7:010:0	God is my shield , saving those whose hearts are true and right .
19:7:011:0	God is an honest judge.He is angry with the wicked every day .
19:7:012:0	If a person does not repent , God will sharpen his sword ; he will bend and string his bow .
19:7:013:0	He will prepare his deadly weaponsand shoot his flaming arrows .
19:7:014:0	The wicked conceive evil ; they are pregnant with troubleand give birth to lies .
19:7:015:0	They dig a deep pit to trap others , then fall into it themselves .
19:7:016:0	The trouble they make for others backfires on them.The violence they plan falls on their own heads .
19:7:017:0	I will thank the Lord because he is just ; I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High .
