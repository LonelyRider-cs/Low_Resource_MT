19:38:001:0	O Lord , do n't rebuke me in your angeror discipline me in your rage !
19:38:002:0	Your arrows have struck deep , and your blows are crushing me .
19:38:003:0	Because of your anger , my whole body is sick ; my health is broken because of my sins .
19:38:004:0	My guilt overwhelms me — it is a burden too heavy to bear .
19:38:005:0	My wounds fester and stinkbecause of my foolish sins .
19:38:006:0	I am bent over and racked with pain.All day long I walk around filled with grief .
19:38:007:0	A raging fever burns within me , and my health is broken .
19:38:008:0	I am exhausted and completely crushed.My groans come from an anguished heart .
19:38:009:0	You know what I long for , Lord ; you hear my every sigh .
19:38:010:0	My heart beats wildly , my strength fails , and I am going blind .
19:38:011:0	My loved ones and friends stay away , fearing my disease.Even my own family stands at a distance .
19:38:012:0	Meanwhile , my enemies lay traps to kill me.Those who wish me harm make plans to ruin me.All day long they plan their treachery .
19:38:013:0	But I am deaf to all their threats.I am silent before them as one who can not speak .
19:38:014:0	I choose to hear nothing , and I make no reply .
19:38:015:0	For I am waiting for you , O Lord.You must answer for me , O Lord my God .
19:38:016:0	I prayed , “ Do n't let my enemies gloat over meor rejoice at my downfall . ”
19:38:017:0	I am on the verge of collapse , facing constant pain .
19:38:018:0	But I confess my sins ; I am deeply sorry for what I have done .
19:38:019:0	I have many aggressive enemies ; they hate me without reason .
19:38:020:0	They repay me evil for goodand oppose me for pursuing good .
19:38:021:0	Do not abandon me , O Lord.Do not stand at a distance , my God .
19:38:022:0	Come quickly to help me , O Lord my savior .
