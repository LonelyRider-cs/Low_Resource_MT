19:109:001:0	O God , whom I praise , do n't stand silent and aloof
19:109:002:0	while the wicked slander meand tell lies about me .
19:109:003:0	They surround me with hateful wordsand fight against me for no reason .
19:109:004:0	I love them , but they try to destroy me with accusationseven as I am praying for them !
19:109:005:0	They repay evil for good , and hatred for my love .
19:109:006:0	They say , “ Get an evil person to turn against him.Send an accuser to bring him to trial .
19:109:007:0	When his case comes up for judgment , let him be pronounced guilty.Count his prayers as sins .
19:109:008:0	Let his years be few ; let someone else take his position .
19:109:009:0	May his children become fatherless , and his wife a widow .
19:109:010:0	May his children wander as beggarsand be driven from their ruined homes .
19:109:011:0	May creditors seize his entire estate , and strangers take all he has earned .
19:109:012:0	Let no one be kind to him ; let no one pity his fatherless children .
19:109:013:0	May all his offspring die.May his family name be blotted out in the next generation .
19:109:014:0	May the Lord never forget the sins of his fathers ; may his mother 's sins never be erased from the record .
19:109:015:0	May the Lord always remember these sins , and may his name disappear from human memory .
19:109:016:0	For he refused all kindness to others ; he persecuted the poor and needy , and he hounded the brokenhearted to death .
19:109:017:0	He loved to curse others ; now you curse him.He never blessed others ; now do n't you bless him .
19:109:018:0	Cursing is as natural to him as his clothing , or the water he drinks , or the rich food he eats .
19:109:019:0	Now may his curses return and cling to him like clothing ; may they be tied around him like a belt . ”
19:109:020:0	May those curses become the Lord 's punishmentfor my accusers who speak evil of me .
19:109:021:0	But deal well with me , O Sovereign Lord , for the sake of your own reputation ! Rescue mebecause you are so faithful and good .
19:109:022:0	For I am poor and needy , and my heart is full of pain .
19:109:023:0	I am fading like a shadow at dusk ; I am brushed off like a locust .
19:109:024:0	My knees are weak from fasting , and I am skin and bones .
19:109:025:0	I am a joke to people everywhere ; when they see me , they shake their heads in scorn .
19:109:026:0	Help me , O Lord my God ! Save me because of your unfailing love .
19:109:027:0	Let them see that this is your doing , that you yourself have done it , Lord .
19:109:028:0	Then let them curse me if they like , but you will bless me ! When they attack me , they will be disgraced ! But I , your servant , will go right on rejoicing !
19:109:029:0	May my accusers be clothed with disgrace ; may their humiliation cover them like a cloak .
19:109:030:0	But I will give repeated thanks to the Lord , praising him to everyone .
19:109:031:0	For he stands beside the needy , ready to save them from those who condemn them .
