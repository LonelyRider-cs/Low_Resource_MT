19:14:001:0	Only fools say in their hearts , “ There is no God. ” They are corrupt , and their actions are evil ; not one of them does good !
19:14:002:0	The Lord looks down from heavenon the entire human race ; he looks to see if anyone is truly wise , if anyone seeks God .
19:14:003:0	But no , all have turned away ; all have become corrupt.No one does good , not a single one !
19:14:004:0	Will those who do evil never learn ? They eat up my people like breadand would n't think of praying to the Lord .
19:14:005:0	Terror will grip them , for God is with those who obey him .
19:14:006:0	The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed , but the Lord will protect his people .
19:14:007:0	Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel ? When the Lord restores his people , Jacob will shout with joy , and Israel will rejoice .
