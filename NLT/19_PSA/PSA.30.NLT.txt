19:30:001:0	I will exalt you , Lord , for you rescued me.You refused to let my enemies triumph over me .
19:30:002:0	O Lord my God , I cried to you for help , and you restored my health .
19:30:003:0	You brought me up from the grave , O Lord.You kept me from falling into the pit of death .
19:30:004:0	Sing to the Lord , all you godly ones ! Praise his holy name .
19:30:005:0	For his anger lasts only a moment , but his favor lasts a lifetime ! Weeping may last through the night , but joy comes with the morning .
19:30:006:0	When I was prosperous , I said , “ Nothing can stop me now ! ”
19:30:007:0	Your favor , O Lord , made me as secure as a mountain.Then you turned away from me , and I was shattered .
19:30:008:0	I cried out to you , O Lord.I begged the Lord for mercy , saying ,
19:30:009:0	“ What will you gain if I die , if I sink into the grave ? Can my dust praise you ? Can it tell of your faithfulness ?
19:30:010:0	Hear me , Lord , and have mercy on me.Help me , O Lord . ”
19:30:011:0	You have turned my mourning into joyful dancing.You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy ,
19:30:012:0	that I might sing praises to you and not be silent.O Lord my God , I will give you thanks forever !
