19:108:001:0	My heart is confident in you , O God ; no wonder I can sing your praises with all my heart !
19:108:002:0	Wake up , lyre and harp ! I will wake the dawn with my song .
19:108:003:0	I will thank you , Lord , among all the people.I will sing your praises among the nations .
19:108:004:0	For your unfailing love is higher than the heavens.Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds .
19:108:005:0	Be exalted , O God , above the highest heavens.May your glory shine over all the earth .
19:108:006:0	Now rescue your beloved people.Answer and save us by your power .
19:108:007:0	God has promised this by his holiness : “ I will divide up Shechem with joy.I will measure out the valley of Succoth .
19:108:008:0	Gilead is mine , and Manasseh , too.Ephraim , my helmet , will produce my warriors , and Judah , my scepter , will produce my kings .
19:108:009:0	But Moab , my washbasin , will become my servant , and I will wipe my feet on Edomand shout in triumph over Philistia . ”
19:108:010:0	Who will bring me into the fortified city ? Who will bring me victory over Edom ?
19:108:011:0	Have you rejected us , O God ? Will you no longer march with our armies ?
19:108:012:0	Oh , please help us against our enemies , for all human help is useless .
19:108:013:0	With God 's help we will do mighty things , for he will trample down our foes .
