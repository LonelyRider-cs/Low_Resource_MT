19:44:001:0	O God , we have heard it with our own earsâ€”our ancestors have told usof all you did in their day , in days long ago :
19:44:002:0	You drove out the pagan nations by your powerand gave all the land to our ancestors.You crushed their enemiesand set our ancestors free .
19:44:003:0	They did not conquer the land with their swords ; it was not their own strong arm that gave them victory.It was your right hand and strong armand the blinding light from your face that helped them , for you loved them .
19:44:004:0	You are my King and my God.You command victories for Israel .
19:44:005:0	Only by your power can we push back our enemies ; only in your name can we trample our foes .
19:44:006:0	I do not trust in my bow ; I do not count on my sword to save me .
19:44:007:0	You are the one who gives us victory over our enemies ; you disgrace those who hate us .
19:44:008:0	O God , we give glory to you all day longand constantly praise your name.Interlude
19:44:009:0	But now you have tossed us aside in dishonor.You no longer lead our armies to battle .
19:44:010:0	You make us retreat from our enemiesand allow those who hate us to plunder our land .
19:44:011:0	You have butchered us like sheepand scattered us among the nations .
19:44:012:0	You sold your precious people for a pittance , making nothing on the sale .
19:44:013:0	You let our neighbors mock us.We are an object of scorn and derision to those around us .
19:44:014:0	You have made us the butt of their jokes ; they shake their heads at us in scorn .
19:44:015:0	We ca n't escape the constant humiliation ; shame is written across our faces .
19:44:016:0	All we hear are the taunts of our mockers.All we see are our vengeful enemies .
19:44:017:0	All this has happened though we have not forgotten you.We have not violated your covenant .
19:44:018:0	Our hearts have not deserted you.We have not strayed from your path .
19:44:019:0	Yet you have crushed us in the jackal 's desert home.You have covered us with darkness and death .
19:44:020:0	If we had forgotten the name of our Godor spread our hands in prayer to foreign gods ,
19:44:021:0	God would surely have known it , for he knows the secrets of every heart .
19:44:022:0	But for your sake we are killed every day ; we are being slaughtered like sheep .
19:44:023:0	Wake up , O Lord ! Why do you sleep ? Get up ! Do not reject us forever .
19:44:024:0	Why do you look the other way ? Why do you ignore our suffering and oppression ?
19:44:025:0	We collapse in the dust , lying face down in the dirt .
19:44:026:0	Rise up ! Help us ! Ransom us because of your unfailing love .
