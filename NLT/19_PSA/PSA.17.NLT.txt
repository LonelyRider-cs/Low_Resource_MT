19:17:001:0	O Lord , hear my plea for justice.Listen to my cry for help.Pay attention to my prayer , for it comes from honest lips .
19:17:002:0	Declare me innocent , for you see those who do right .
19:17:003:0	You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night.You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong.I am determined not to sin in what I say .
19:17:004:0	I have followed your commands , which keep me from following cruel and evil people .
19:17:005:0	My steps have stayed on your path ; I have not wavered from following you .
19:17:006:0	I am praying to you because I know you will answer , O God.Bend down and listen as I pray .
19:17:007:0	Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways.By your mighty power you rescuethose who seek refuge from their enemies .
19:17:008:0	Guard me as you would guard your own eyes.Hide me in the shadow of your wings .
19:17:009:0	Protect me from wicked people who attack me , from murderous enemies who surround me .
19:17:010:0	They are without pity.Listen to their boasting !
19:17:011:0	They track me down and surround me , watching for the chance to throw me to the ground .
19:17:012:0	They are like hungry lions , eager to tear me apartâ€”like young lions hiding in ambush .
19:17:013:0	Arise , O Lord ! Stand against them , and bring them to their knees ! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword !
19:17:014:0	By the power of your hand , O Lord , destroy those who look to this world for their reward.But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones.May their children have plenty , leaving an inheritance for their descendants .
19:17:015:0	Because I am righteous , I will see you.When I awake , I will see you face to face and be satisfied .
