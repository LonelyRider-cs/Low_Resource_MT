19:32:001:0	Oh , what joy for thosewhose disobedience is forgiven , whose sin is put out of sight !
19:32:002:0	Yes , what joy for thosewhose record the Lord has cleared of guilt , whose lives are lived in complete honesty !
19:32:003:0	When I refused to confess my sin , my body wasted away , and I groaned all day long .
19:32:004:0	Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me.My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat.Interlude
19:32:005:0	Finally , I confessed all my sins to youand stopped trying to hide my guilt.I said to myself , “ I will confess my rebellion to the Lord. ” And you forgave me ! All my guilt is gone.Interlude
19:32:006:0	Therefore , let all the godly pray to you while there is still time , that they may not drown in the floodwaters of judgment .
19:32:007:0	For you are my hiding place ; you protect me from trouble.You surround me with songs of victory.Interlude
19:32:008:0	The Lord says , “ I will guide you along the best pathway for your life.I will advise you and watch over you .
19:32:009:0	Do not be like a senseless horse or mulethat needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control . ”
19:32:010:0	Many sorrows come to the wicked , but unfailing love surrounds those who trust the Lord .
19:32:011:0	So rejoice in the Lord and be glad , all you who obey him ! Shout for joy , all you whose hearts are pure !
