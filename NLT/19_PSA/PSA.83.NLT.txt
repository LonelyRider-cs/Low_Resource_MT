19:83:001:0	O God , do not be silent ! Do not be deaf.Do not be quiet , O God .
19:83:002:0	Do n't you hear the uproar of your enemies ? Do n't you see that your arrogant enemies are rising up ?
19:83:003:0	They devise crafty schemes against your people ; they conspire against your precious ones .
19:83:004:0	“ Come , ” they say , “ let us wipe out Israel as a nation.We will destroy the very memory of its existence . ”
19:83:005:0	Yes , this was their unanimous decision.They signed a treaty as allies against you —
19:83:006:0	these Edomites and Ishmaelites ; Moabites and Hagrites ;
19:83:007:0	Gebalites , Ammonites , and Amalekites ; and people from Philistia and Tyre .
19:83:008:0	Assyria has joined them , too , and is allied with the descendants of Lot.Interlude
19:83:009:0	Do to them as you did to the Midianitesand as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River .
19:83:010:0	They were destroyed at Endor , and their decaying corpses fertilized the soil .
19:83:011:0	Let their mighty nobles die as Oreb and Zeeb did.Let all their princes die like Zebah and Zalmunna ,
19:83:012:0	for they said , “ Let us seize for our own usethese pasturelands of God ! ”
19:83:013:0	O my God , scatter them like tumbleweed , like chaff before the wind !
19:83:014:0	As a fire burns a forestand as a flame sets mountains ablaze ,
19:83:015:0	chase them with your fierce storm ; terrify them with your tempest .
19:83:016:0	Utterly disgrace themuntil they submit to your name , O Lord .
19:83:017:0	Let them be ashamed and terrified forever.Let them die in disgrace .
19:83:018:0	Then they will learn that you alone are called the Lord , that you alone are the Most High , supreme over all the earth .
