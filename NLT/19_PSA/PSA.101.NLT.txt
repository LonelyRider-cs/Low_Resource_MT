19:101:001:0	I will sing of your love and justice , Lord.I will praise you with songs .
19:101:002:0	I will be careful to live a blameless life â€” when will you come to help me ? I will lead a life of integrityin my own home .
19:101:003:0	I will refuse to look atanything vile and vulgar.I hate all who deal crookedly ; I will have nothing to do with them .
19:101:004:0	I will reject perverse ideasand stay away from every evil .
19:101:005:0	I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbors.I will not endure conceit and pride .
19:101:006:0	I will search for faithful peopleto be my companions.Only those who are above reproachwill be allowed to serve me .
19:101:007:0	I will not allow deceivers to serve in my house , and liars will not stay in my presence .
19:101:008:0	My daily task will be to ferret out the wickedand free the city of the Lord from their grip .
