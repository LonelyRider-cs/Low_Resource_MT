19:89:001:0	I will sing of the Lord 's unfailing love forever ! Young and old will hear of your faithfulness .
19:89:002:0	Your unfailing love will last forever.Your faithfulness is as enduring as the heavens .
19:89:003:0	The Lord said , “ I have made a covenant with David , my chosen servant.I have sworn this oath to him :
19:89:004:0	‘ I will establish your descendants as kings forever ; they will sit on your throne from now until eternity . ' ” Interlude
19:89:005:0	All heaven will praise your great wonders , Lord ; myriads of angels will praise you for your faithfulness .
19:89:006:0	For who in all of heaven can compare with the Lord ? What mightiest angel is anything like the Lord ?
19:89:007:0	The highest angelic powers stand in awe of God.He is far more awesome than all who surround his throne .
19:89:008:0	O Lord God of Heaven 's Armies ! Where is there anyone as mighty as you , O Lord ? You are entirely faithful .
19:89:009:0	You rule the oceans.You subdue their storm-tossed waves .
19:89:010:0	You crushed the great sea monster.You scattered your enemies with your mighty arm .
19:89:011:0	The heavens are yours , and the earth is yours ; everything in the world is yours — you created it all .
19:89:012:0	You created north and south.Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon praise your name .
19:89:013:0	Powerful is your arm ! Strong is your hand ! Your right hand is lifted high in glorious strength .
19:89:014:0	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.Unfailing love and truth walk before you as attendants .
19:89:015:0	Happy are those who hear the joyful call to worship , for they will walk in the light of your presence , Lord .
19:89:016:0	They rejoice all day long in your wonderful reputation.They exult in your righteousness .
19:89:017:0	You are their glorious strength.It pleases you to make us strong .
19:89:018:0	Yes , our protection comes from the Lord , and he , the Holy One of Israel , has given us our king .
19:89:019:0	Long ago you spoke in a vision to your faithful people.You said , “ I have raised up a warrior.I have selected him from the common people to be king .
19:89:020:0	I have found my servant David.I have anointed him with my holy oil .
19:89:021:0	I will steady him with my hand ; with my powerful arm I will make him strong .
19:89:022:0	His enemies will not defeat him , nor will the wicked overpower him .
19:89:023:0	I will beat down his adversaries before himand destroy those who hate him .
19:89:024:0	My faithfulness and unfailing love will be with him , and by my authority he will grow in power .
19:89:025:0	I will extend his rule over the sea , his dominion over the rivers .
19:89:026:0	And he will call out to me , ‘ You are my Father , my God , and the Rock of my salvation . '
19:89:027:0	I will make him my firstborn son , the mightiest king on earth .
19:89:028:0	I will love him and be kind to him forever ; my covenant with him will never end .
19:89:029:0	I will preserve an heir for him ; his throne will be as endless as the days of heaven .
19:89:030:0	But if his descendants forsake my instructionsand fail to obey my regulations ,
19:89:031:0	if they do not obey my decreesand fail to keep my commands ,
19:89:032:0	then I will punish their sin with the rod , and their disobedience with beating .
19:89:033:0	But I will never stop loving himnor fail to keep my promise to him .
19:89:034:0	No , I will not break my covenant ; I will not take back a single word I said .
19:89:035:0	I have sworn an oath to David , and in my holiness I can not lie :
19:89:036:0	His dynasty will go on forever ; his kingdom will endure as the sun .
19:89:037:0	It will be as eternal as the moon , my faithful witness in the sky ! ” Interlude
19:89:038:0	But now you have rejected him and cast him off.You are angry with your anointed king .
19:89:039:0	You have renounced your covenant with him ; you have thrown his crown in the dust .
19:89:040:0	You have broken down the walls protecting himand ruined every fort defending him .
19:89:041:0	Everyone who comes along has robbed him , and he has become a joke to his neighbors .
19:89:042:0	You have strengthened his enemiesand made them all rejoice .
19:89:043:0	You have made his sword uselessand refused to help him in battle .
19:89:044:0	You have ended his splendorand overturned his throne .
19:89:045:0	You have made him old before his timeand publicly disgraced him.Interlude
19:89:046:0	O Lord , how long will this go on ? Will you hide yourself forever ? How long will your anger burn like fire ?
19:89:047:0	Remember how short my life is , how empty and futile this human existence !
19:89:048:0	No one can live forever ; all will die.No one can escape the power of the grave.Interlude
19:89:049:0	Lord , where is your unfailing love ? You promised it to David with a faithful pledge .
19:89:050:0	Consider , Lord , how your servants are disgraced ! I carry in my heart the insults of so many people .
19:89:051:0	Your enemies have mocked me , O Lord ; they mock your anointed king wherever he goes .
19:89:052:0	Praise the Lord forever ! Amen and amen !
