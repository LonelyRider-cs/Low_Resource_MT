19:90:001:1	Book Four
19:90:002:1	( Psalms 90–106 )
19:90:001:0	Lord , through all the generationsyou have been our home !
19:90:002:0	Before the mountains were born , before you gave birth to the earth and the world , from beginning to end , you are God .
19:90:003:0	You turn people back to dust , saying , “ Return to dust , you mortals ! ”
19:90:004:0	For you , a thousand years are as a passing day , as brief as a few night hours .
19:90:005:0	You sweep people away like dreams that disappear.They are like grass that springs up in the morning .
19:90:006:0	In the morning it blooms and flourishes , but by evening it is dry and withered .
19:90:007:0	We wither beneath your anger ; we are overwhelmed by your fury .
19:90:008:0	You spread out our sins before you — our secret sins — and you see them all .
19:90:009:0	We live our lives beneath your wrath , ending our years with a groan .
19:90:010:0	Seventy years are given to us ! Some even live to eighty.But even the best years are filled with pain and trouble ; soon they disappear , and we fly away .
19:90:011:0	Who can comprehend the power of your anger ? Your wrath is as awesome as the fear you deserve .
19:90:012:0	Teach us to realize the brevity of life , so that we may grow in wisdom .
19:90:013:0	O Lord , come back to us ! How long will you delay ? Take pity on your servants !
19:90:014:0	Satisfy us each morning with your unfailing love , so we may sing for joy to the end of our lives .
19:90:015:0	Give us gladness in proportion to our former misery ! Replace the evil years with good .
19:90:016:0	Let us , your servants , see you work again ; let our children see your glory .
19:90:017:0	And may the Lord our God show us his approvaland make our efforts successful.Yes , make our efforts successful !
