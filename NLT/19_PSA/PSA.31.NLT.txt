19:31:001:0	O Lord , I have come to you for protection ; do n't let me be disgraced.Save me , for you do what is right .
19:31:002:0	Turn your ear to listen to me ; rescue me quickly.Be my rock of protection , a fortress where I will be safe .
19:31:003:0	You are my rock and my fortress.For the honor of your name , lead me out of this danger .
19:31:004:0	Pull me from the trap my enemies set for me , for I find protection in you alone .
19:31:005:0	I entrust my spirit into your hand.Rescue me , Lord , for you are a faithful God .
19:31:006:0	I hate those who worship worthless idols.I trust in the Lord .
19:31:007:0	I will be glad and rejoice in your unfailing love , for you have seen my troubles , and you care about the anguish of my soul .
19:31:008:0	You have not handed me over to my enemiesbut have set me in a safe place .
19:31:009:0	Have mercy on me , Lord , for I am in distress.Tears blur my eyes.My body and soul are withering away .
19:31:010:0	I am dying from grief ; my years are shortened by sadness.Sin has drained my strength ; I am wasting away from within .
19:31:011:0	I am scorned by all my enemiesand despised by my neighbors — even my friends are afraid to come near me.When they see me on the street , they run the other way .
19:31:012:0	I am ignored as if I were dead , as if I were a broken pot .
19:31:013:0	I have heard the many rumors about me , and I am surrounded by terror.My enemies conspire against me , plotting to take my life .
19:31:014:0	But I am trusting you , O Lord , saying , “ You are my God ! ”
19:31:015:0	My future is in your hands.Rescue me from those who hunt me down relentlessly .
19:31:016:0	Let your favor shine on your servant.In your unfailing love , rescue me .
19:31:017:0	Do n't let me be disgraced , O Lord , for I call out to you for help.Let the wicked be disgraced ; let them lie silent in the grave .
19:31:018:0	Silence their lying lips — those proud and arrogant lips that accuse the godly .
19:31:019:0	How great is the goodnessyou have stored up for those who fear you.You lavish it on those who come to you for protection , blessing them before the watching world .
19:31:020:0	You hide them in the shelter of your presence , safe from those who conspire against them.You shelter them in your presence , far from accusing tongues .
19:31:021:0	Praise the Lord , for he has shown me the wonders of his unfailing love.He kept me safe when my city was under attack .
19:31:022:0	In panic I cried out , “ I am cut off from the Lord ! ” But you heard my cry for mercyand answered my call for help .
19:31:023:0	Love the Lord , all you godly ones ! For the Lord protects those who are loyal to him , but he harshly punishes the arrogant .
19:31:024:0	So be strong and courageous , all you who put your hope in the Lord !
