19:60:001:0	You have rejected us , O God , and broken our defenses.You have been angry with us ; now restore us to your favor .
19:60:002:0	You have shaken our land and split it open.Seal the cracks , for the land trembles .
19:60:003:0	You have been very hard on us , making us drink wine that sent us reeling .
19:60:004:0	But you have raised a banner for those who fear you—a rallying point in the face of attack.Interlude
19:60:005:0	Now rescue your beloved people.Answer and save us by your power .
19:60:006:0	God has promised this by his holiness : “ I will divide up Shechem with joy.I will measure out the valley of Succoth .
19:60:007:0	Gilead is mine , and Manasseh , too.Ephraim , my helmet , will produce my warriors , and Judah , my scepter , will produce my kings .
19:60:008:0	But Moab , my washbasin , will become my servant , and I will wipe my feet on Edomand shout in triumph over Philistia . ”
19:60:009:0	Who will bring me into the fortified city ? Who will bring me victory over Edom ?
19:60:010:0	Have you rejected us , O God ? Will you no longer march with our armies ?
19:60:011:0	Oh , please help us against our enemies , for all human help is useless .
19:60:012:0	With God 's help we will do mighty things , for he will trample down our foes .
