19:56:001:0	O God , have mercy on me , for people are hounding me.My foes attack me all day long .
19:56:002:0	I am constantly hounded by those who slander me , and many are boldly attacking me .
19:56:003:0	But when I am afraid , I will put my trust in you .
19:56:004:0	I praise God for what he has promised.I trust in God , so why should I be afraid ? What can mere mortals do to me ?
19:56:005:0	They are always twisting what I say ; they spend their days plotting to harm me .
19:56:006:0	They come together to spy on meâ€”watching my every step , eager to kill me .
19:56:007:0	Do n't let them get away with their wickedness ; in your anger , O God , bring them down .
19:56:008:0	You keep track of all my sorrows.You have collected all my tears in your bottle.You have recorded each one in your book .
19:56:009:0	My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help.This I know : God is on my side !
19:56:010:0	I praise God for what he has promised ; yes , I praise the Lord for what he has promised .
19:56:011:0	I trust in God , so why should I be afraid ? What can mere mortals do to me ?
19:56:012:0	I will fulfill my vows to you , O God , and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help .
19:56:013:0	For you have rescued me from death ; you have kept my feet from slipping.So now I can walk in your presence , O God , in your life-giving light .
