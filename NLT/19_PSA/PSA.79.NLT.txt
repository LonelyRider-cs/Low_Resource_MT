19:79:001:0	O God , pagan nations have conquered your land , your special possession.They have defiled your holy Templeand made Jerusalem a heap of ruins .
19:79:002:0	They have left the bodies of your servantsas food for the birds of heaven.The flesh of your godly oneshas become food for the wild animals .
19:79:003:0	Blood has flowed like water all around Jerusalem ; no one is left to bury the dead .
19:79:004:0	We are mocked by our neighbors , an object of scorn and derision to those around us .
19:79:005:0	O Lord , how long will you be angry with us ? Forever ? How long will your jealousy burn like fire ?
19:79:006:0	Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you — on kingdoms that do not call upon your name .
19:79:007:0	For they have devoured your people Israel , making the land a desolate wilderness .
19:79:008:0	Do not hold us guilty for the sins of our ancestors ! Let your compassion quickly meet our needs , for we are on the brink of despair .
19:79:009:0	Help us , O God of our salvation ! Help us for the glory of your name.Save us and forgive our sinsfor the honor of your name .
19:79:010:0	Why should pagan nations be allowed to scoff , asking , “ Where is their God ? ” Show us your vengeance against the nations , for they have spilled the blood of your servants .
19:79:011:0	Listen to the moaning of the prisoners.Demonstrate your great power by saving those condemned to die .
19:79:012:0	O Lord , pay back our neighbors seven timesfor the scorn they have hurled at you .
19:79:013:0	Then we your people , the sheep of your pasture , will thank you forever and ever , praising your greatness from generation to generation .
