19:115:001:0	Not to us , O Lord , not to us , but to your name goes all the gloryfor your unfailing love and faithfulness .
19:115:002:0	Why let the nations say , “ Where is their God ? ”
19:115:003:0	Our God is in the heavens , and he does as he wishes .
19:115:004:0	Their idols are merely things of silver and gold , shaped by human hands .
19:115:005:0	They have mouths but can not speak , and eyes but can not see .
19:115:006:0	They have ears but can not hear , and noses but can not smell .
19:115:007:0	They have hands but can not feel , and feet but can not walk , and throats but can not make a sound .
19:115:008:0	And those who make idols are just like them , as are all who trust in them .
19:115:009:0	O Israel , trust the Lord ! He is your helper and your shield .
19:115:010:0	O priests , descendants of Aaron , trust the Lord ! He is your helper and your shield .
19:115:011:0	All you who fear the Lord , trust the Lord ! He is your helper and your shield .
19:115:012:0	The Lord remembers us and will bless us.He will bless the people of Israeland bless the priests , the descendants of Aaron .
19:115:013:0	He will bless those who fear the Lord , both great and lowly .
19:115:014:0	May the Lord richly blessboth you and your children .
19:115:015:0	May you be blessed by the Lord , who made heaven and earth .
19:115:016:0	The heavens belong to the Lord , but he has given the earth to all humanity .
19:115:017:0	The dead can not sing praises to the Lord , for they have gone into the silence of the grave .
19:115:018:0	But we can praise the Lordboth now and forever ! Praise the Lord !
