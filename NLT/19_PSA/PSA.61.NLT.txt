19:61:001:0	O God , listen to my cry ! Hear my prayer !
19:61:002:0	From the ends of the earth , I cry to you for helpwhen my heart is overwhelmed.Lead me to the towering rock of safety ,
19:61:003:0	for you are my safe refuge , a fortress where my enemies can not reach me .
19:61:004:0	Let me live forever in your sanctuary , safe beneath the shelter of your wings ! Interlude
19:61:005:0	For you have heard my vows , O God.You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name .
19:61:006:0	Add many years to the life of the king ! May his years span the generations !
19:61:007:0	May he reign under God 's protection forever.May your unfailing love and faithfulness watch over him .
19:61:008:0	Then I will sing praises to your name foreveras I fulfill my vows each day .
