19:70:001:0	Please , God , rescue me ! Come quickly , Lord , and help me .
19:70:002:0	May those who try to kill mebe humiliated and put to shame.May those who take delight in my troublebe turned back in disgrace .
19:70:003:0	Let them be horrified by their shame , for they said , “ Aha ! We 've got him now ! ”
19:70:004:0	But may all who search for yoube filled with joy and gladness in you.May those who love your salvationrepeatedly shout , “ God is great ! ”
19:70:005:0	But as for me , I am poor and needy ; please hurry to my aid , O God.You are my helper and my savior ; O Lord , do not delay .
