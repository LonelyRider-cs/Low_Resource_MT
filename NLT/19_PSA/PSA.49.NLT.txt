19:49:001:0	Listen to this , all you people ! Pay attention , everyone in the world !
19:49:002:0	High and low , rich and poor â€” listen !
19:49:003:0	For my words are wise , and my thoughts are filled with insight .
19:49:004:0	I listen carefully to many proverbsand solve riddles with inspiration from a harp .
19:49:005:0	Why should I fear when trouble comes , when enemies surround me ?
19:49:006:0	They trust in their wealthand boast of great riches .
19:49:007:0	Yet they can not redeem themselves from deathby paying a ransom to God .
19:49:008:0	Redemption does not come so easily , for no one can ever pay enough
19:49:009:0	to live foreverand never see the grave .
19:49:010:0	Those who are wise must finally die , just like the foolish and senseless , leaving all their wealth behind .
19:49:011:0	The grave is their eternal home , where they will stay forever.They may name their estates after themselves ,
19:49:012:0	but their fame will not last.They will die , just like animals .
19:49:013:0	This is the fate of fools , though they are remembered as being wise.Interlude
19:49:014:0	Like sheep , they are led to the grave , where death will be their shepherd.In the morning the godly will rule over them.Their bodies will rot in the grave , far from their grand estates .
19:49:015:0	But as for me , God will redeem my life.He will snatch me from the power of the grave.Interlude
19:49:016:0	So do n't be dismayed when the wicked grow richand their homes become ever more splendid .
19:49:017:0	For when they die , they take nothing with them.Their wealth will not follow them into the grave .
19:49:018:0	In this life they consider themselves fortunateand are applauded for their success .
19:49:019:0	But they will die like all before themand never again see the light of day .
19:49:020:0	People who boast of their wealth do n't understand ; they will die , just like animals .
