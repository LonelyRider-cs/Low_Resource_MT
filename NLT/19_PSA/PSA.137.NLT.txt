19:137:001:0	Beside the rivers of Babylon , we sat and weptas we thought of Jerusalem .
19:137:002:0	We put away our harps , hanging them on the branches of poplar trees .
19:137:003:0	For our captors demanded a song from us.Our tormentors insisted on a joyful hymn : “ Sing us one of those songs of Jerusalem ! ”
19:137:004:0	But how can we sing the songs of the Lordwhile in a pagan land ?
19:137:005:0	If I forget you , O Jerusalem , let my right hand forget how to play the harp .
19:137:006:0	May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouthif I fail to remember you , if I do n't make Jerusalem my greatest joy .
19:137:007:0	O Lord , remember what the Edomites didon the day the armies of Babylon captured Jerusalem. “ Destroy it ! ” they yelled. “ Level it to the ground ! ”
19:137:008:0	O Babylon , you will be destroyed.Happy is the one who pays you backfor what you have done to us .
19:137:009:0	Happy is the one who takes your babiesand smashes them against the rocks !
