19:78:001:0	O my people , listen to my instructions.Open your ears to what I am saying ,
19:78:002:0	for I will speak to you in a parable.I will teach you hidden lessons from our past—
19:78:003:0	stories we have heard and known , stories our ancestors handed down to us .
19:78:004:0	We will not hide these truths from our children ; we will tell the next generationabout the glorious deeds of the Lord , about his power and his mighty wonders .
19:78:005:0	For he issued his laws to Jacob ; he gave his instructions to Israel.He commanded our ancestorsto teach them to their children ,
19:78:006:0	so the next generation might know them—even the children not yet born—and they in turn will teach their own children .
19:78:007:0	So each generation should set its hope anew on God , not forgetting his glorious miraclesand obeying his commands .
19:78:008:0	Then they will not be like their ancestors—stubborn , rebellious , and unfaithful , refusing to give their hearts to God .
19:78:009:0	The warriors of Ephraim , though armed with bows , turned their backs and fled on the day of battle .
19:78:010:0	They did not keep God 's covenantand refused to live by his instructions .
19:78:011:0	They forgot what he had done—the great wonders he had shown them ,
19:78:012:0	the miracles he did for their ancestorson the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt .
19:78:013:0	For he divided the sea and led them through , making the water stand up like walls !
19:78:014:0	In the daytime he led them by a cloud , and all night by a pillar of fire .
19:78:015:0	He split open the rocks in the wildernessto give them water , as from a gushing spring .
19:78:016:0	He made streams pour from the rock , making the waters flow down like a river !
19:78:017:0	Yet they kept on sinning against him , rebelling against the Most High in the desert .
19:78:018:0	They stubbornly tested God in their hearts , demanding the foods they craved .
19:78:019:0	They even spoke against God himself , saying , “ God ca n't give us food in the wilderness .
19:78:020:0	Yes , he can strike a rock so water gushes out , but he ca n't give his people bread and meat . ”
19:78:021:0	When the Lord heard them , he was furious.The fire of his wrath burned against Jacob.Yes , his anger rose against Israel ,
19:78:022:0	for they did not believe Godor trust him to care for them .
19:78:023:0	But he commanded the skies to open ; he opened the doors of heaven .
19:78:024:0	He rained down manna for them to eat ; he gave them bread from heaven .
19:78:025:0	They ate the food of angels ! God gave them all they could hold .
19:78:026:0	He released the east wind in the heavensand guided the south wind by his mighty power .
19:78:027:0	He rained down meat as thick as dust—birds as plentiful as the sand on the seashore !
19:78:028:0	He caused the birds to fall within their campand all around their tents .
19:78:029:0	The people ate their fill.He gave them what they craved .
19:78:030:0	But before they satisfied their craving , while the meat was yet in their mouths ,
19:78:031:0	the anger of God rose against them , and he killed their strongest men.He struck down the finest of Israel 's young men .
19:78:032:0	But in spite of this , the people kept sinning.Despite his wonders , they refused to trust him .
19:78:033:0	So he ended their lives in failure , their years in terror .
19:78:034:0	When God began killing them , they finally sought him.They repented and took God seriously .
19:78:035:0	Then they remembered that God was their rock , that God Most High was their redeemer .
19:78:036:0	But all they gave him was lip service ; they lied to him with their tongues .
19:78:037:0	Their hearts were not loyal to him.They did not keep his covenant .
19:78:038:0	Yet he was merciful and forgave their sinsand did not destroy them all.Many times he held back his angerand did not unleash his fury !
19:78:039:0	For he remembered that they were merely mortal , gone like a breath of wind that never returns .
19:78:040:0	Oh , how often they rebelled against him in the wildernessand grieved his heart in that dry wasteland .
19:78:041:0	Again and again they tested God 's patienceand provoked the Holy One of Israel .
19:78:042:0	They did not remember his powerand how he rescued them from their enemies .
19:78:043:0	They did not remember his miraculous signs in Egypt , his wonders on the plain of Zoan .
19:78:044:0	For he turned their rivers into blood , so no one could drink from the streams .
19:78:045:0	He sent vast swarms of flies to consume themand hordes of frogs to ruin them .
19:78:046:0	He gave their crops to caterpillars ; their harvest was consumed by locusts .
19:78:047:0	He destroyed their grapevines with hailand shattered their sycamore-figs with sleet .
19:78:048:0	He abandoned their cattle to the hail , their livestock to bolts of lightning .
19:78:049:0	He loosed on them his fierce anger—all his fury , rage , and hostility.He dispatched against thema band of destroying angels .
19:78:050:0	He turned his anger against them ; he did not spare the Egyptians ' livesbut ravaged them with the plague .
19:78:051:0	He killed the oldest son in each Egyptian family , the flower of youth throughout the land of Egypt .
19:78:052:0	But he led his own people like a flock of sheep , guiding them safely through the wilderness .
19:78:053:0	He kept them safe so they were not afraid ; but the sea covered their enemies .
19:78:054:0	He brought them to the border of his holy land , to this land of hills he had won for them .
19:78:055:0	He drove out the nations before them ; he gave them their inheritance by lot.He settled the tribes of Israel into their homes .
19:78:056:0	But they kept testing and rebelling against God Most High.They did not obey his laws .
19:78:057:0	They turned back and were as faithless as their parents.They were as undependable as a crooked bow .
19:78:058:0	They angered God by building shrines to other gods ; they made him jealous with their idols .
19:78:059:0	When God heard them , he was very angry , and he completely rejected Israel .
19:78:060:0	Then he abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh , the Tabernacle where he had lived among the people .
19:78:061:0	He allowed the Ark of his might to be captured ; he surrendered his glory into enemy hands .
19:78:062:0	He gave his people over to be butchered by the sword , because he was so angry with his own people—his special possession .
19:78:063:0	Their young men were killed by fire ; their young women died before singing their wedding songs .
19:78:064:0	Their priests were slaughtered , and their widows could not mourn their deaths .
19:78:065:0	Then the Lord rose up as though waking from sleep , like a warrior aroused from a drunken stupor .
19:78:066:0	He routed his enemiesand sent them to eternal shame .
19:78:067:0	But he rejected Joseph 's descendants ; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim .
19:78:068:0	He chose instead the tribe of Judah , and Mount Zion , which he loved .
19:78:069:0	There he built his sanctuary as high as the heavens , as solid and enduring as the earth .
19:78:070:0	He chose his servant David , calling him from the sheep pens .
19:78:071:0	He took David from tending the ewes and lambsand made him the shepherd of Jacob 's descendants—God 's own people , Israel .
19:78:072:0	He cared for them with a true heartand led them with skillful hands .
