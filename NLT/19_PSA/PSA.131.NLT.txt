19:131:001:0	Lord , my heart is not proud ; my eyes are not haughty.I do n't concern myself with matters too greator too awesome for me to grasp .
19:131:002:0	Instead , I have calmed and quieted myself , like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mother 's milk.Yes , like a weaned child is my soul within me .
19:131:003:0	O Israel , put your hope in the Lord â€” now and always .
