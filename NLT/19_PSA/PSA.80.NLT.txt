19:80:001:0	Please listen , O Shepherd of Israel , you who lead Joseph 's descendants like a flock.O God , enthroned above the cherubim , display your radiant glory
19:80:002:0	to Ephraim , Benjamin , and Manasseh.Show us your mighty power.Come to rescue us !
19:80:003:0	Turn us again to yourself , O God.Make your face shine down upon us.Only then will we be saved .
19:80:004:0	O Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , how long will you be angry with our prayers ?
19:80:005:0	You have fed us with sorrowand made us drink tears by the bucketful .
19:80:006:0	You have made us the scorn of neighboring nations.Our enemies treat us as a joke .
19:80:007:0	Turn us again to yourself , O God of Heaven 's Armies.Make your face shine down upon us.Only then will we be saved .
19:80:008:0	You brought us from Egypt like a grapevine ; you drove away the pagan nations and transplanted us into your land .
19:80:009:0	You cleared the ground for us , and we took root and filled the land .
19:80:010:0	Our shade covered the mountains ; our branches covered the mighty cedars .
19:80:011:0	We spread our branches west to the Mediterranean Sea ; our shoots spread east to the Euphrates River .
19:80:012:0	But now , why have you broken down our wallsso that all who pass by may steal our fruit ?
19:80:013:0	The wild boar from the forest devours it , and the wild animals feed on it .
19:80:014:0	Come back , we beg you , O God of Heaven 's Armies.Look down from heaven and see our plight.Take care of this grapevine
19:80:015:0	that you yourself have planted , this son you have raised for yourself .
19:80:016:0	For we are chopped up and burned by our enemies.May they perish at the sight of your frown .
19:80:017:0	Strengthen the man you love , the son of your choice .
19:80:018:0	Then we will never abandon you again.Revive us so we can call on your name once more .
19:80:019:0	Turn us again to yourself , O Lord God of Heaven 's Armies.Make your face shine down upon us.Only then will we be saved .
