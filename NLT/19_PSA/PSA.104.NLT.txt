19:104:001:0	Let all that I am praise the Lord.O Lord my God , how great you are ! You are robed with honor and majesty .
19:104:002:0	You are dressed in a robe of light.You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens ;
19:104:003:0	you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.You make the clouds your chariot ; you ride upon the wings of the wind .
19:104:004:0	The winds are your messengers ; flames of fire are your servants .
19:104:005:0	You placed the world on its foundationso it would never be moved .
19:104:006:0	You clothed the earth with floods of water , water that covered even the mountains .
19:104:007:0	At your command , the water fled ; at the sound of your thunder , it hurried away .
19:104:008:0	Mountains rose and valleys sankto the levels you decreed .
19:104:009:0	Then you set a firm boundary for the seas , so they would never again cover the earth .
19:104:010:0	You make springs pour water into the ravines , so streams gush down from the mountains .
19:104:011:0	They provide water for all the animals , and the wild donkeys quench their thirst .
19:104:012:0	The birds nest beside the streamsand sing among the branches of the trees .
19:104:013:0	You send rain on the mountains from your heavenly home , and you fill the earth with the fruit of your labor .
19:104:014:0	You cause grass to grow for the livestockand plants for people to use.You allow them to produce food from the earth—
19:104:015:0	wine to make them glad , olive oil to soothe their skin , and bread to give them strength .
19:104:016:0	The trees of the Lord are well cared for—the cedars of Lebanon that he planted .
19:104:017:0	There the birds make their nests , and the storks make their homes in the cypresses .
19:104:018:0	High in the mountains live the wild goats , and the rocks form a refuge for the hyraxes .
19:104:019:0	You made the moon to mark the seasons , and the sun knows when to set .
19:104:020:0	You send the darkness , and it becomes night , when all the forest animals prowl about .
19:104:021:0	Then the young lions roar for their prey , stalking the food provided by God .
19:104:022:0	At dawn they slink backinto their dens to rest .
19:104:023:0	Then people go off to their work , where they labor until evening .
19:104:024:0	O Lord , what a variety of things you have made ! In wisdom you have made them all.The earth is full of your creatures .
19:104:025:0	Here is the ocean , vast and wide , teeming with life of every kind , both large and small .
19:104:026:0	See the ships sailing along , and Leviathan , which you made to play in the sea .
19:104:027:0	They all depend on youto give them food as they need it .
19:104:028:0	When you supply it , they gather it.You open your hand to feed them , and they are richly satisfied .
19:104:029:0	But if you turn away from them , they panic.When you take away their breath , they die and turn again to dust .
19:104:030:0	When you give them your breath , life is created , and you renew the face of the earth .
19:104:031:0	May the glory of the Lord continue forever ! The Lord takes pleasure in all he has made !
19:104:032:0	The earth trembles at his glance ; the mountains smoke at his touch .
19:104:033:0	I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.I will praise my God to my last breath !
19:104:034:0	May all my thoughts be pleasing to him , for I rejoice in the Lord .
19:104:035:0	Let all sinners vanish from the face of the earth ; let the wicked disappear forever.Let all that I am praise the Lord.Praise the Lord !
