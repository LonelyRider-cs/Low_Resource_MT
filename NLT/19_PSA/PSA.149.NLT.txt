19:149:001:0	Praise the Lord ! Sing to the Lord a new song.Sing his praises in the assembly of the faithful .
19:149:002:0	O Israel , rejoice in your Maker.O people of Jerusalem , exult in your King .
19:149:003:0	Praise his name with dancing , accompanied by tambourine and harp .
19:149:004:0	For the Lord delights in his people ; he crowns the humble with victory .
19:149:005:0	Let the faithful rejoice that he honors them.Let them sing for joy as they lie on their beds .
19:149:006:0	Let the praises of God be in their mouths , and a sharp sword in their hands â€”
19:149:007:0	to execute vengeance on the nationsand punishment on the peoples ,
19:149:008:0	to bind their kings with shacklesand their leaders with iron chains ,
19:149:009:0	to execute the judgment written against them.This is the glorious privilege of his faithful ones.Praise the Lord !
