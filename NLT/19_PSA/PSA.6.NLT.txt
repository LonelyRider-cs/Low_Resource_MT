19:6:001:0	O Lord , do n't rebuke me in your angeror discipline me in your rage .
19:6:002:0	Have compassion on me , Lord , for I am weak.Heal me , Lord , for my bones are in agony .
19:6:003:0	I am sick at heart.How long , O Lord , until you restore me ?
19:6:004:0	Return , O Lord , and rescue me.Save me because of your unfailing love .
19:6:005:0	For the dead do not remember you.Who can praise you from the grave ?
19:6:006:0	I am worn out from sobbing.All night I flood my bed with weeping , drenching it with my tears .
19:6:007:0	My vision is blurred by grief ; my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies .
19:6:008:0	Go away , all you who do evil , for the Lord has heard my weeping .
19:6:009:0	The Lord has heard my plea ; the Lord will answer my prayer .
19:6:010:0	May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified.May they suddenly turn back in shame .
