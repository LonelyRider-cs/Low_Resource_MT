19:54:001:0	Come with great power , O God , and rescue me ! Defend me with your might .
19:54:002:0	Listen to my prayer , O God.Pay attention to my plea .
19:54:003:0	For strangers are attacking me ; violent people are trying to kill me.They care nothing for God.Interlude
19:54:004:0	But God is my helper.The Lord keeps me alive !
19:54:005:0	May the evil plans of my enemies be turned against them.Do as you promised and put an end to them .
19:54:006:0	I will sacrifice a voluntary offering to you ; I will praise your name , O Lord , for it is good .
19:54:007:0	For you have rescued me from my troublesand helped me to triumph over my enemies .
