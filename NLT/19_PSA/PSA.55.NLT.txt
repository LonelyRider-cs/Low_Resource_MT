19:55:001:0	Listen to my prayer , O God.Do not ignore my cry for help !
19:55:002:0	Please listen and answer me , for I am overwhelmed by my troubles .
19:55:003:0	My enemies shout at me , making loud and wicked threats.They bring trouble on meand angrily hunt me down .
19:55:004:0	My heart pounds in my chest.The terror of death assaults me .
19:55:005:0	Fear and trembling overwhelm me , and I ca n't stop shaking .
19:55:006:0	Oh , that I had wings like a dove ; then I would fly away and rest !
19:55:007:0	I would fly far awayto the quiet of the wilderness.Interlude
19:55:008:0	How quickly I would escape—far from this wild storm of hatred .
19:55:009:0	Confuse them , Lord , and frustrate their plans , for I see violence and conflict in the city .
19:55:010:0	Its walls are patrolled day and night against invaders , but the real danger is wickedness within the city .
19:55:011:0	Everything is falling apart ; threats and cheating are rampant in the streets .
19:55:012:0	It is not an enemy who taunts me—I could bear that.It is not my foes who so arrogantly insult me—I could have hidden from them .
19:55:013:0	Instead , it is you—my equal , my companion and close friend .
19:55:014:0	What good fellowship we once enjoyedas we walked together to the house of God .
19:55:015:0	Let death stalk my enemies ; let the grave swallow them alive , for evil makes its home within them .
19:55:016:0	But I will call on God , and the Lord will rescue me .
19:55:017:0	Morning , noon , and nightI cry out in my distress , and the Lord hears my voice .
19:55:018:0	He ransoms me and keeps me safefrom the battle waged against me , though many still oppose me .
19:55:019:0	God , who has ruled forever , will hear me and humble them.InterludeFor my enemies refuse to change their ways ; they do not fear God .
19:55:020:0	As for my companion , he betrayed his friends ; he broke his promises .
19:55:021:0	His words are as smooth as butter , but in his heart is war.His words are as soothing as lotion , but underneath are daggers !
19:55:022:0	Give your burdens to the Lord , and he will take care of you.He will not permit the godly to slip and fall .
19:55:023:0	But you , O God , will send the wickeddown to the pit of destruction.Murderers and liars will die young , but I am trusting you to save me .
