19:127:001:0	Unless the Lord builds a house , the work of the builders is wasted.Unless the Lord protects a city , guarding it with sentries will do no good .
19:127:002:0	It is useless for you to work so hardfrom early morning until late at night , anxiously working for food to eat ; for God gives rest to his loved ones .
19:127:003:0	Children are a gift from the Lord ; they are a reward from him .
19:127:004:0	Children born to a young manare like arrows in a warrior 's hands .
19:127:005:0	How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them ! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates .
