19:46:002:0	So we will not fear when earthquakes comeand the mountains crumble into the sea .
19:46:003:0	Let the oceans roar and foam.Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge ! Interlude
19:46:004:0	A river brings joy to the city of our God , the sacred home of the Most High .
19:46:005:0	God dwells in that city ; it can not be destroyed.From the very break of day , God will protect it .
19:46:006:0	The nations are in chaos , and their kingdoms crumble ! God 's voice thunders , and the earth melts !
19:46:007:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies is here among us ; the God of Israel is our fortress.Interlude
19:46:008:0	Come , see the glorious works of the Lord : See how he brings destruction upon the world .
19:46:009:0	He causes wars to end throughout the earth.He breaks the bow and snaps the spear ; he burns the shields with fire .
19:46:010:0	“ Be still , and know that I am God ! I will be honored by every nation.I will be honored throughout the world . ”
19:46:011:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies is here among us ; the God of Israel is our fortress.Interlude
