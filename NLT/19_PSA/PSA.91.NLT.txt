19:91:005:0	Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night , nor the arrow that flies in the day .
19:91:006:0	Do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness , nor the disaster that strikes at midday .
19:91:007:0	Though a thousand fall at your side , though ten thousand are dying around you , these evils will not touch you .
19:91:008:0	Just open your eyes , and see how the wicked are punished .
19:91:009:0	If you make the Lord your refuge , if you make the Most High your shelter ,
19:91:010:0	no evil will conquer you ; no plague will come near your home .

19:91:013:0	You will trample upon lions and cobras ; you will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet !
19:91:014:0	The Lord says , “ I will rescue those who love me.I will protect those who trust in my name .
19:91:015:0	When they call on me , I will answer ; I will be with them in trouble.I will rescue and honor them .
