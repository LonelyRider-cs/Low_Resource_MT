19:52:002:0	All day long you plot destruction.Your tongue cuts like a sharp razor ; you 're an expert at telling lies .
19:52:003:0	You love evil more than goodand lies more than truth.Interlude
19:52:004:0	You love to destroy others with your words , you liar !
19:52:005:0	But God will strike you down once and for all.He will pull you from your homeand uproot you from the land of the living.Interlude
19:52:006:0	The righteous will see it and be amazed.They will laugh and say ,
19:52:007:0	“ Look what happens to mighty warriorswho do not trust in God.They trust their wealth insteadand grow more and more bold in their wickedness . ”
19:52:008:0	But I am like an olive tree , thriving in the house of God.I will always trust in God 's unfailing love .
19:52:009:0	I will praise you forever , O God , for what you have done.I will trust in your good namein the presence of your faithful people .
