19:62:001:0	I wait quietly before God , for my victory comes from him .
19:62:002:0	He alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress where I will never be shaken .
19:62:003:0	So many enemies against one manâ€”all of them trying to kill me.To them I 'm just a broken-down wallor a tottering fence .
19:62:004:0	They plan to topple me from my high position.They delight in telling lies about me.They praise me to my facebut curse me in their hearts.Interlude
19:62:005:0	Let all that I am wait quietly before God , for my hope is in him .
19:62:006:0	He alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress where I will not be shaken .
19:62:007:0	My victory and honor come from God alone.He is my refuge , a rock where no enemy can reach me .
19:62:008:0	O my people , trust in him at all times.Pour out your heart to him , for God is our refuge.Interlude
19:62:009:0	Common people are as worthless as a puff of wind , and the powerful are not what they appear to be.If you weigh them on the scales , together they are lighter than a breath of air .
19:62:010:0	Do n't make your living by extortionor put your hope in stealing.And if your wealth increases , do n't make it the center of your life .
19:62:011:0	God has spoken plainly , and I have heard it many times : Power , O God , belongs to you ;
19:62:012:0	unfailing love , O Lord , is yours.Surely you repay all peopleaccording to what they have done .
