19:16:001:0	Keep me safe , O God , for I have come to you for refuge .
19:16:002:0	I said to the Lord , “ You are my Master ! Every good thing I have comes from you . ”
19:16:003:0	The godly people in the landare my true heroes ! I take pleasure in them !
19:16:004:0	Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods.I will not take part in their sacrifices of bloodor even speak the names of their gods .
19:16:005:0	Lord , you alone are my inheritance , my cup of blessing.You guard all that is mine .
19:16:006:0	The land you have given me is a pleasant land.What a wonderful inheritance !
19:16:007:0	I will bless the Lord who guides me ; even at night my heart instructs me .
19:16:008:0	I know the Lord is always with me.I will not be shaken , for he is right beside me .
19:16:009:0	No wonder my heart is glad , and I rejoice.My body rests in safety .
19:16:010:0	For you will not leave my soul among the deador allow your holy one to rot in the grave .
19:16:011:0	You will show me the way of life , granting me the joy of your presenceand the pleasures of living with you forever .
