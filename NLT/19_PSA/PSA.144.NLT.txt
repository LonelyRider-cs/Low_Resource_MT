19:144:001:0	Praise the Lord , who is my rock.He trains my hands for warand gives my fingers skill for battle .
19:144:002:0	He is my loving ally and my fortress , my tower of safety , my rescuer.He is my shield , and I take refuge in him.He makes the nations submit to me .
19:144:003:0	O Lord , what are human beings that you should notice them , mere mortals that you should think about them ?
19:144:004:0	For they are like a breath of air ; their days are like a passing shadow .
19:144:005:0	Open the heavens , Lord , and come down.Touch the mountains so they billow smoke .
19:144:006:0	Hurl your lightning bolts and scatter your enemies ! Shoot your arrows and confuse them !
19:144:007:0	Reach down from heaven and rescue me ; rescue me from deep waters , from the power of my enemies .
19:144:008:0	Their mouths are full of lies ; they swear to tell the truth , but they lie instead .
19:144:009:0	I will sing a new song to you , O God ! I will sing your praises with a ten-stringed harp .
19:144:010:0	For you grant victory to kings ! You rescued your servant David from the fatal sword .
19:144:011:0	Save me ! Rescue me from the power of my enemies.Their mouths are full of lies ; they swear to tell the truth , but they lie instead .
19:144:012:0	May our sons flourish in their youthlike well-nurtured plants.May our daughters be like graceful pillars , carved to beautify a palace .
19:144:013:0	May our barns be filledwith crops of every kind.May the flocks in our fields multiply by the thousands , even tens of thousands ,
19:144:014:0	and may our oxen be loaded down with produce.May there be no enemy breaking through our walls , no going into captivity , no cries of alarm in our town squares .
19:144:015:0	Yes , joyful are those who live like this ! Joyful indeed are those whose God is the Lord .
