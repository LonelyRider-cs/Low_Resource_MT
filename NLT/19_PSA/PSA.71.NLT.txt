19:71:001:0	O Lord , I have come to you for protection ; do n't let me be disgraced .
19:71:002:0	Save me and rescue me , for you do what is right.Turn your ear to listen to me , and set me free .
19:71:003:0	Be my rock of safetywhere I can always hide.Give the order to save me , for you are my rock and my fortress .
19:71:004:0	My God , rescue me from the power of the wicked , from the clutches of cruel oppressors .
19:71:005:0	O Lord , you alone are my hope.I 've trusted you , O Lord , from childhood .
19:71:006:0	Yes , you have been with me from birth ; from my mother 's womb you have cared for me.No wonder I am always praising you !
19:71:007:0	My life is an example to many , because you have been my strength and protection .
19:71:008:0	That is why I can never stop praising you ; I declare your glory all day long .
19:71:009:0	And now , in my old age , do n't set me aside.Do n't abandon me when my strength is failing .
19:71:010:0	For my enemies are whispering against me.They are plotting together to kill me .
19:71:011:0	They say , “ God has abandoned him.Let 's go and get him , for no one will help him now . ”
19:71:012:0	O God , do n't stay away.My God , please hurry to help me .
19:71:013:0	Bring disgrace and destruction on my accusers.Humiliate and shame those who want to harm me .
19:71:014:0	But I will keep on hoping for your help ; I will praise you more and more .
19:71:015:0	I will tell everyone about your righteousness.All day long I will proclaim your saving power , though I am not skilled with words .
19:71:016:0	I will praise your mighty deeds , O Sovereign Lord.I will tell everyone that you alone are just .
19:71:017:0	O God , you have taught me from my earliest childhood , and I constantly tell others about the wonderful things you do .
19:71:018:0	Now that I am old and gray , do not abandon me , O God.Let me proclaim your power to this new generation , your mighty miracles to all who come after me .
19:71:019:0	Your righteousness , O God , reaches to the highest heavens.You have done such wonderful things.Who can compare with you , O God ?
19:71:020:0	You have allowed me to suffer much hardship , but you will restore me to life againand lift me up from the depths of the earth .
19:71:021:0	You will restore me to even greater honorand comfort me once again .
19:71:022:0	Then I will praise you with music on the harp , because you are faithful to your promises , O my God.I will sing praises to you with a lyre , O Holy One of Israel .
19:71:023:0	I will shout for joy and sing your praises , for you have ransomed me .
19:71:024:0	I will tell about your righteous deedsall day long , for everyone who tried to hurt mehas been shamed and humiliated .
