19:107:001:1	Book Five
19:107:002:1	( Psalms 107–150 )
19:107:001:0	Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good ! His faithful love endures forever .
19:107:002:0	Has the Lord redeemed you ? Then speak out ! Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies .
19:107:003:0	For he has gathered the exiles from many lands , from east and west , from north and south .
19:107:004:0	Some wandered in the wilderness , lost and homeless .
19:107:005:0	Hungry and thirsty , they nearly died .
19:107:006:0	“ Lord , help ! ” they cried in their trouble , and he rescued them from their distress .
19:107:007:0	He led them straight to safety , to a city where they could live .
19:107:008:0	Let them praise the Lord for his great loveand for the wonderful things he has done for them .
19:107:009:0	For he satisfies the thirstyand fills the hungry with good things .
19:107:010:0	Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom , imprisoned in iron chains of misery .
19:107:011:0	They rebelled against the words of God , scorning the counsel of the Most High .
19:107:012:0	That is why he broke them with hard labor ; they fell , and no one was there to help them .
19:107:013:0	“ Lord , help ! ” they cried in their trouble , and he saved them from their distress .
19:107:014:0	He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom ; he snapped their chains .
19:107:015:0	Let them praise the Lord for his great loveand for the wonderful things he has done for them .
19:107:016:0	For he broke down their prison gates of bronze ; he cut apart their bars of iron .
19:107:017:0	Some were fools ; they rebelledand suffered for their sins .
19:107:018:0	They could n't stand the thought of food , and they were knocking on death 's door .
19:107:019:0	“ Lord , help ! ” they cried in their trouble , and he saved them from their distress .
19:107:020:0	He sent out his word and healed them , snatching them from the door of death .
19:107:021:0	Let them praise the Lord for his great loveand for the wonderful things he has done for them .
19:107:022:0	Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgivingand sing joyfully about his glorious acts .
19:107:023:0	Some went off to sea in ships , plying the trade routes of the world .
19:107:024:0	They , too , observed the Lord 's power in action , his impressive works on the deepest seas .
19:107:025:0	He spoke , and the winds rose , stirring up the waves .
19:107:026:0	Their ships were tossed to the heavensand plunged again to the depths ; the sailors cringed in terror .
19:107:027:0	They reeled and staggered like drunkardsand were at their wits ' end .
19:107:028:0	“ Lord , help ! ” they cried in their trouble , and he saved them from their distress .
19:107:029:0	He calmed the storm to a whisperand stilled the waves .
19:107:030:0	What a blessing was that stillnessas he brought them safely into harbor !
19:107:031:0	Let them praise the Lord for his great loveand for the wonderful things he has done for them .
19:107:032:0	Let them exalt him publicly before the congregationand before the leaders of the nation .
19:107:033:0	He changes rivers into deserts , and springs of water into dry , thirsty land .
19:107:034:0	He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands , because of the wickedness of those who live there .
19:107:035:0	But he also turns deserts into pools of water , the dry land into springs of water .
19:107:036:0	He brings the hungry to settle thereand to build their cities .
19:107:037:0	They sow their fields , plant their vineyards , and harvest their bumper crops .
19:107:038:0	How he blesses them ! They raise large families there , and their herds of livestock increase .
19:107:039:0	When they decrease in number and become impoverishedthrough oppression , trouble , and sorrow ,
19:107:040:0	the Lord pours contempt on their princes , causing them to wander in trackless wastelands .
19:107:041:0	But he rescues the poor from troubleand increases their families like flocks of sheep .
19:107:042:0	The godly will see these things and be glad , while the wicked are struck silent .
19:107:043:0	Those who are wise will take all this to heart ; they will see in our history the faithful love of the Lord .
