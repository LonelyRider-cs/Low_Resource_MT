19:18:001:0	I love you , Lord ; you are my strength .
19:18:002:0	The Lord is my rock , my fortress , and my savior ; my God is my rock , in whom I find protection.He is my shield , the power that saves me , and my place of safety .
19:18:003:0	I called on the Lord , who is worthy of praise , and he saved me from my enemies .
19:18:004:0	The ropes of death entangled me ; floods of destruction swept over me .
19:18:005:0	The grave wrapped its ropes around me ; death laid a trap in my path .
19:18:006:0	But in my distress I cried out to the Lord ; yes , I prayed to my God for help.He heard me from his sanctuary ; my cry to him reached his ears .
19:18:007:0	Then the earth quaked and trembled.The foundations of the mountains shook ; they quaked because of his anger .
19:18:008:0	Smoke poured from his nostrils ; fierce flames leaped from his mouth.Glowing coals blazed forth from him .
19:18:009:0	He opened the heavens and came down ; dark storm clouds were beneath his feet .
19:18:010:0	Mounted on a mighty angelic being , he flew , soaring on the wings of the wind .
19:18:011:0	He shrouded himself in darkness , veiling his approach with dark rain clouds .
19:18:012:0	Thick clouds shielded the brightness around himand rained down hail and burning coals .
19:18:013:0	The Lord thundered from heaven ; the voice of the Most High resoundedamid the hail and burning coals .
19:18:014:0	He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies ; great bolts of lightning flashed , and they were confused .
19:18:015:0	Then at your command , O Lord , at the blast of your breath , the bottom of the sea could be seen , and the foundations of the earth were laid bare .
19:18:016:0	He reached down from heaven and rescued me ; he drew me out of deep waters .
19:18:017:0	He rescued me from my powerful enemies , from those who hated me and were too strong for me .
19:18:018:0	They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress , but the Lord supported me .
19:18:019:0	He led me to a place of safety ; he rescued me because he delights in me .
19:18:020:0	The Lord rewarded me for doing right ; he restored me because of my innocence .
19:18:021:0	For I have kept the ways of the Lord ; I have not turned from my God to follow evil .
19:18:022:0	I have followed all his regulations ; I have never abandoned his decrees .
19:18:023:0	I am blameless before God ; I have kept myself from sin .
19:18:024:0	The Lord rewarded me for doing right.He has seen my innocence .
19:18:025:0	To the faithful you show yourself faithful ; to those with integrity you show integrity .
19:18:026:0	To the pure you show yourself pure , but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd .
19:18:027:0	You rescue the humble , but you humiliate the proud .
19:18:028:0	You light a lamp for me.The Lord , my God , lights up my darkness .
19:18:029:0	In your strength I can crush an army ; with my God I can scale any wall .
19:18:030:0	God 's way is perfect.All the Lord 's promises prove true.He is a shield for all who look to him for protection .
19:18:031:0	For who is God except the Lord ? Who but our God is a solid rock ?
19:18:032:0	God arms me with strength , and he makes my way perfect .
19:18:033:0	He makes me as surefooted as a deer , enabling me to stand on mountain heights .
19:18:034:0	He trains my hands for battle ; he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow .
19:18:035:0	You have given me your shield of victory.Your right hand supports me ; your help has made me great .
19:18:036:0	You have made a wide path for my feetto keep them from slipping .
19:18:037:0	I chased my enemies and caught them ; I did not stop until they were conquered .
19:18:038:0	I struck them down so they could not get up ; they fell beneath my feet .
19:18:039:0	You have armed me with strength for the battle ; you have subdued my enemies under my feet .
19:18:040:0	You placed my foot on their necks.I have destroyed all who hated me .
19:18:041:0	They called for help , but no one came to their rescue.They even cried to the Lord , but he refused to answer .
19:18:042:0	I ground them as fine as dust in the wind.I swept them into the gutter like dirt .
19:18:043:0	You gave me victory over my accusers.You appointed me ruler over nations ; people I do n't even know now serve me .
19:18:044:0	As soon as they hear of me , they submit ; foreign nations cringe before me .
19:18:045:0	They all lose their courageand come trembling from their strongholds .
19:18:046:0	The Lord lives ! Praise to my Rock ! May the God of my salvation be exalted !
19:18:047:0	He is the God who pays back those who harm me ; he subdues the nations under me
19:18:048:0	and rescues me from my enemies.You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies ; you save me from violent opponents .
19:18:049:0	For this , O Lord , I will praise you among the nations ; I will sing praises to your name .
19:18:050:0	You give great victories to your king ; you show unfailing love to your anointed , to David and all his descendants forever .
