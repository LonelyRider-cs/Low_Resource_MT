19:121:001:0	I look up to the mountains â€” does my help come from there ?
19:121:002:0	My help comes from the Lord , who made heaven and earth !
19:121:003:0	He will not let you stumble ; the one who watches over you will not slumber .
19:121:004:0	Indeed , he who watches over Israelnever slumbers or sleeps .
19:121:005:0	The Lord himself watches over you ! The Lord stands beside you as your protective shade .
19:121:006:0	The sun will not harm you by day , nor the moon at night .
19:121:007:0	The Lord keeps you from all harmand watches over your life .
19:121:008:0	The Lord keeps watch over you as you come and go , both now and forever .
