19:51:001:0	Have mercy on me , O God , because of your unfailing love.Because of your great compassion , blot out the stain of my sins .
19:51:002:0	Wash me clean from my guilt.Purify me from my sin .
19:51:003:0	For I recognize my rebellion ; it haunts me day and night .
19:51:004:0	Against you , and you alone , have I sinned ; I have done what is evil in your sight.You will be proved right in what you say , and your judgment against me is just .
19:51:005:0	For I was born a sinner—yes , from the moment my mother conceived me .
19:51:006:0	But you desire honesty from the womb , teaching me wisdom even there .
19:51:007:0	Purify me from my sins , and I will be clean ; wash me , and I will be whiter than snow .
19:51:008:0	Oh , give me back my joy again ; you have broken me—now let me rejoice .
19:51:009:0	Do n't keep looking at my sins.Remove the stain of my guilt .
19:51:010:0	Create in me a clean heart , O God.Renew a loyal spirit within me .
19:51:011:0	Do not banish me from your presence , and do n't take your Holy Spirit from me .
19:51:012:0	Restore to me the joy of your salvation , and make me willing to obey you .
19:51:013:0	Then I will teach your ways to rebels , and they will return to you .
19:51:014:0	Forgive me for shedding blood , O God who saves ; then I will joyfully sing of your forgiveness .
19:51:015:0	Unseal my lips , O Lord , that my mouth may praise you .
19:51:016:0	You do not desire a sacrifice , or I would offer one.You do not want a burnt offering .
19:51:017:0	The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit.You will not reject a broken and repentant heart , O God .
19:51:018:0	Look with favor on Zion and help her ; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem .
19:51:019:0	Then you will be pleased with sacrifices offered in the right spirit—with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings.Then bulls will again be sacrificed on your altar .
