19:48:001:0	How great is the Lord , how deserving of praise , in the city of our God , which sits on his holy mountain !
19:48:002:0	It is high and magnificent ; the whole earth rejoices to see it ! Mount Zion , the holy mountain , is the city of the great King !
19:48:003:0	God himself is in Jerusalem 's towers , revealing himself as its defender .
19:48:004:0	The kings of the earth joined forcesand advanced against the city .
19:48:005:0	But when they saw it , they were stunned ; they were terrified and ran away .
19:48:006:0	They were gripped with terrorand writhed in pain like a woman in labor .
19:48:007:0	You destroyed them like the mighty ships of Tarshishshattered by a powerful east wind .
19:48:008:0	We had heard of the city 's glory , but now we have seen it ourselvesâ€”the city of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies.It is the city of our God ; he will make it safe forever.Interlude
19:48:009:0	O God , we meditate on your unfailing loveas we worship in your Temple .
19:48:010:0	As your name deserves , O God , you will be praised to the ends of the earth.Your strong right hand is filled with victory .
19:48:011:0	Let the people on Mount Zion rejoice.Let all the towns of Judah be gladbecause of your justice .
19:48:012:0	Go , inspect the city of Jerusalem.Walk around and count the many towers .
19:48:013:0	Take note of the fortified walls , and tour all the citadels , that you may describe themto future generations .
19:48:014:0	For that is what God is like.He is our God forever and ever , and he will guide us until we die .
