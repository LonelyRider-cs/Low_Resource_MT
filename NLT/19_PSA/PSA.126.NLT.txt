19:126:001:0	When the Lord brought back his exiles to Jerusalem , it was like a dream !
19:126:002:0	We were filled with laughter , and we sang for joy.And the other nations said , “ What amazing things the Lord has done for them . ”
19:126:003:0	Yes , the Lord has done amazing things for us ! What joy !
19:126:004:0	Restore our fortunes , Lord , as streams renew the desert .
19:126:005:0	Those who plant in tearswill harvest with shouts of joy .
19:126:006:0	They weep as they go to plant their seed , but they sing as they return with the harvest .
