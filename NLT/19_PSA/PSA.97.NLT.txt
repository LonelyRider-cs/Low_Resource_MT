19:97:001:0	The Lord is king ! Let the earth rejoice ! Let the farthest coastlands be glad .
19:97:002:0	Dark clouds surround him.Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne .
19:97:003:0	Fire spreads ahead of himand burns up all his foes .
19:97:004:0	His lightning flashes out across the world.The earth sees and trembles .
19:97:005:0	The mountains melt like wax before the Lord , before the Lord of all the earth .
19:97:006:0	The heavens proclaim his righteousness ; every nation sees his glory .
19:97:007:0	Those who worship idols are disgraced — all who brag about their worthless gods — for every god must bow to him .
19:97:008:0	Jerusalem has heard and rejoiced , and all the towns of Judah are gladbecause of your justice , O Lord !
19:97:009:0	For you , O Lord , are supreme over all the earth ; you are exalted far above all gods .
19:97:010:0	You who love the Lord , hate evil ! He protects the lives of his godly peopleand rescues them from the power of the wicked .
19:97:011:0	Light shines on the godly , and joy on those whose hearts are right .
19:97:012:0	May all who are godly rejoice in the Lordand praise his holy name !
