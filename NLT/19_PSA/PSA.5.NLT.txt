19:5:001:0	O Lord , hear me as I pray ; pay attention to my groaning .
19:5:002:0	Listen to my cry for help , my King and my God , for I pray to no one but you .
19:5:003:0	Listen to my voice in the morning , Lord.Each morning I bring my requests to you and wait expectantly .
19:5:004:0	O God , you take no pleasure in wickedness ; you can not tolerate the sins of the wicked .
19:5:005:0	Therefore , the proud may not stand in your presence , for you hate all who do evil .
19:5:006:0	You will destroy those who tell lies.The Lord detests murderers and deceivers .
19:5:007:0	Because of your unfailing love , I can enter your house ; I will worship at your Temple with deepest awe .
19:5:008:0	Lead me in the right path , O Lord , or my enemies will conquer me.Make your way plain for me to follow .
19:5:009:0	My enemies can not speak a truthful word.Their deepest desire is to destroy others.Their talk is foul , like the stench from an open grave.Their tongues are filled with flattery .
19:5:010:0	O God , declare them guilty.Let them be caught in their own traps.Drive them away because of their many sins , for they have rebelled against you .
19:5:011:0	But let all who take refuge in you rejoice ; let them sing joyful praises forever.Spread your protection over them , that all who love your name may be filled with joy .
19:5:012:0	For you bless the godly , O Lord ; you surround them with your shield of love .
