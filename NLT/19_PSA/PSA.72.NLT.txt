19:72:003:0	May the mountains yield prosperity for all , and may the hills be fruitful .
19:72:004:0	Help him to defend the poor , to rescue the children of the needy , and to crush their oppressors .
19:72:005:0	May they fear you as long as the sun shines , as long as the moon remains in the sky.Yes , forever !
19:72:006:0	May the king 's rule be refreshing like spring rain on freshly cut grass , like the showers that water the earth .
19:72:007:0	May all the godly flourish during his reign.May there be abundant prosperity until the moon is no more .
19:72:008:0	May he reign from sea to sea , and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth .
