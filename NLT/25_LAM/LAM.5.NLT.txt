25:5:001:1	Prayer for Restoration
25:5:001:0	Lord , remember what has happened to us.See how we have been disgraced !
25:5:002:0	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers , our homes to foreigners .
25:5:003:0	We are orphaned and fatherless.Our mothers are widowed .
25:5:004:0	We have to pay for water to drink , and even firewood is expensive .
25:5:005:0	Those who pursue us are at our heels ; we are exhausted but are given no rest .
25:5:006:0	We submitted to Egypt and Assyriato get enough food to survive .
25:5:007:0	Our ancestors sinned , but they have died â€” and we are suffering the punishment they deserved !
25:5:008:0	Slaves have now become our masters ; there is no one left to rescue us .
25:5:009:0	We hunt for food at the risk of our lives , for violence rules the countryside .
25:5:010:0	The famine has blackened our skinas though baked in an oven .
25:5:011:0	Our enemies rape the women in Jerusalemand the young girls in all the towns of Judah .
25:5:012:0	Our princes are being hanged by their thumbs , and our elders are treated with contempt .
25:5:013:0	Young men are led away to work at millstones , and boys stagger under heavy loads of wood .
25:5:014:0	The elders no longer sit in the city gates ; the young men no longer dance and sing .
25:5:015:0	Joy has left our hearts ; our dancing has turned to mourning .
25:5:016:0	The garlands have fallen from our heads.Weep for us because we have sinned .
25:5:017:0	Our hearts are sick and weary , and our eyes grow dim with tears .
25:5:018:0	For Jerusalem is empty and desolate , a place haunted by jackals .
25:5:019:0	But Lord , you remain the same forever ! Your throne continues from generation to generation .
25:5:020:0	Why do you continue to forget us ? Why have you abandoned us for so long ?
25:5:021:0	Restore us , O Lord , and bring us back to you again ! Give us back the joys we once had !
25:5:022:0	Or have you utterly rejected us ? Are you angry with us still ?
