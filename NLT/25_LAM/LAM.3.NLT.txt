25:3:001:1	Hope in the
25:3:002:1	Lord
25:3:003:1	's Faithfulness
25:3:001:0	I am the one who has seen the afflictionsthat come from the rod of the Lord 's anger .
25:3:002:0	He has led me into darkness , shutting out all light .
25:3:003:0	He has turned his hand against meagain and again , all day long .
25:3:004:0	He has made my skin and flesh grow old.He has broken my bones .
25:3:005:0	He has besieged and surrounded mewith anguish and distress .
25:3:006:0	He has buried me in a dark place , like those long dead .
25:3:007:0	He has walled me in , and I can not escape.He has bound me in heavy chains .
25:3:008:0	And though I cry and shout , he has shut out my prayers .
25:3:009:0	He has blocked my way with a high stone wall ; he has made my road crooked .
25:3:010:0	He has hidden like a bear or a lion , waiting to attack me .
25:3:011:0	He has dragged me off the path and torn me in pieces , leaving me helpless and devastated .
25:3:012:0	He has drawn his bowand made me the target for his arrows .
25:3:013:0	He shot his arrowsdeep into my heart .
25:3:014:0	My own people laugh at me.All day long they sing their mocking songs .
25:3:015:0	He has filled me with bitternessand given me a bitter cup of sorrow to drink .
25:3:016:0	He has made me chew on gravel.He has rolled me in the dust .
25:3:017:0	Peace has been stripped away , and I have forgotten what prosperity is .
25:3:018:0	I cry out , “ My splendor is gone ! Everything I had hoped for from the Lord is lost ! ”
25:3:019:0	The thought of my suffering and homelessnessis bitter beyond words .
25:3:020:0	I will never forget this awful time , as I grieve over my loss .
25:3:021:0	Yet I still dare to hopewhen I remember this :
25:3:022:0	The faithful love of the Lord never ends ! His mercies never cease .
25:3:023:0	Great is his faithfulness ; his mercies begin afresh each morning .
25:3:024:0	I say to myself , “ The Lord is my inheritance ; therefore , I will hope in him ! ”
25:3:025:0	The Lord is good to those who depend on him , to those who search for him .
25:3:026:0	So it is good to wait quietlyfor salvation from the Lord .
25:3:027:0	And it is good for people to submit at an early ageto the yoke of his discipline :
25:3:028:0	Let them sit alone in silencebeneath the Lord 's demands .
25:3:029:0	Let them lie face down in the dust , for there may be hope at last .
25:3:030:0	Let them turn the other cheek to those who strike themand accept the insults of their enemies .
25:3:031:0	For no one is abandonedby the Lord forever .
25:3:032:0	Though he brings grief , he also shows compassionbecause of the greatness of his unfailing love .
25:3:033:0	For he does not enjoy hurting peopleor causing them sorrow .
25:3:034:0	If people crush underfootall the prisoners of the land ,
25:3:035:0	if they deprive others of their rightsin defiance of the Most High ,
25:3:036:0	if they twist justice in the courts—does n't the Lord see all these things ?
25:3:037:0	Who can command things to happenwithout the Lord 's permission ?
25:3:038:0	Does not the Most Highsend both calamity and good ?
25:3:039:0	Then why should we , mere humans , complainwhen we are punished for our sins ?
25:3:040:0	Instead , let us test and examine our ways.Let us turn back to the Lord .
25:3:041:0	Let us lift our hearts and handsto God in heaven and say ,
25:3:042:0	“ We have sinned and rebelled , and you have not forgiven us .
25:3:043:0	“ You have engulfed us with your anger , chased us down , and slaughtered us without mercy .
25:3:044:0	You have hidden yourself in a cloudso our prayers can not reach you .
25:3:045:0	You have discarded us as refuse and garbageamong the nations .
25:3:046:0	“ All our enemieshave spoken out against us .
25:3:047:0	We are filled with fear , for we are trapped , devastated , and ruined . ”
25:3:048:0	Tears stream from my eyesbecause of the destruction of my people !
25:3:049:0	My tears flow endlessly ; they will not stop
25:3:050:0	until the Lord looks downfrom heaven and sees .
25:3:051:0	My heart is breakingover the fate of all the women of Jerusalem .
25:3:052:0	My enemies , whom I have never harmed , hunted me down like a bird .
25:3:053:0	They threw me into a pitand dropped stones on me .
25:3:054:0	The water rose over my head , and I cried out , “ This is the end ! ”
25:3:055:0	But I called on your name , Lord , from deep within the pit .
25:3:056:0	You heard me when I cried , “ Listen to my pleading ! Hear my cry for help ! ”
25:3:057:0	Yes , you came when I called ; you told me , “ Do not fear . ”
25:3:058:0	Lord , you have come to my defense ; you have redeemed my life .
25:3:059:0	You have seen the wrong they have done to me , Lord.Be my judge , and prove me right .
25:3:060:0	You have seen the vengeful plotsmy enemies have laid against me .
25:3:061:0	Lord , you have heard the vile names they call me.You know all about the plans they have made .
25:3:062:0	My enemies whisper and mutteras they plot against me all day long .
25:3:063:0	Look at them ! Whether they sit or stand , I am the object of their mocking songs .
25:3:064:0	Pay them back , Lord , for all the evil they have done .
25:3:065:0	Give them hard and stubborn hearts , and then let your curse fall on them !
25:3:066:0	Chase them down in your anger , destroying them beneath the Lord 's heavens .
