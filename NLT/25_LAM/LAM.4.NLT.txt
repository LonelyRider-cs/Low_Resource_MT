25:4:001:1	God 's Anger Satisfied
25:4:001:0	How the gold has lost its luster ! Even the finest gold has become dull.The sacred gemstoneslie scattered in the streets !
25:4:002:0	See how the precious children of Jerusalem , worth their weight in fine gold , are now treated like pots of claymade by a common potter .
25:4:003:0	Even the jackals feed their young , but not my people Israel.They ignore their children 's cries , like ostriches in the desert .
25:4:004:0	The parched tongues of their little onesstick to the roofs of their mouths in thirst.The children cry for bread , but no one has any to give them .
25:4:005:0	The people who once ate the richest foodsnow beg in the streets for anything they can get.Those who once wore the finest clothesnow search the garbage dumps for food .
25:4:006:0	The guilt of my peopleis greater than that of Sodom , where utter disaster struck in a momentand no hand offered help .
25:4:007:0	Our princes once glowed with health — brighter than snow , whiter than milk.Their faces were as ruddy as rubies , their appearance like fine jewels .
25:4:008:0	But now their faces are blacker than soot.No one recognizes them in the streets.Their skin sticks to their bones ; it is as dry and hard as wood .
25:4:009:0	Those killed by the sword are better offthan those who die of hunger.Starving , they waste awayfor lack of food from the fields .
25:4:010:0	Tenderhearted womenhave cooked their own children.They have eaten themto survive the siege .
25:4:011:0	But now the anger of the Lord is satisfied.His fierce anger has been poured out.He started a fire in Jerusalemthat burned the city to its foundations .
25:4:012:0	Not a king in all the earth — no one in all the world — would have believed that an enemycould march through the gates of Jerusalem .
25:4:013:0	Yet it happened because of the sins of her prophetsand the sins of her priests , who defiled the cityby shedding innocent blood .
25:4:014:0	They wandered blindlythrough the streets , so defiled by bloodthat no one dared touch them .
25:4:015:0	“ Get away ! ” the people shouted at them. “ You 're defiled ! Do n't touch us ! ” So they fled to distant landsand wandered among foreign nations , but none would let them stay .
25:4:016:0	The Lord himself has scattered them , and he no longer helps them.People show no respect for the priestsand no longer honor the leaders .
25:4:017:0	We looked in vain for our alliesto come and save us , but we were looking to nationsthat could not help us .
25:4:018:0	We could n't go into the streetswithout danger to our lives.Our end was near ; our days were numbered.We were doomed !
25:4:019:0	Our enemies were swifter than eagles in flight.If we fled to the mountains , they found us.If we hid in the wilderness , they were waiting for us there .
25:4:020:0	Our king — the Lord 's anointed , the very life of our nation — was caught in their snares.We had thought that his shadowwould protect us against any nation on earth !
25:4:021:0	Are you rejoicing in the land of Uz , O people of Edom ? But you , too , must drink from the cup of the Lord 's anger.You , too , will be stripped naked in your drunkenness .
25:4:022:0	O beautiful Jerusalem , your punishment will end ; you will soon return from exile.But Edom , your punishment is just beginning ; soon your many sins will be exposed .
