25:1:001:1	Sorrow in Jerusalem
25:1:001:0	Jerusalem , once so full of people , is now deserted.She who was once great among the nationsnow sits alone like a widow.Once the queen of all the earth , she is now a slave .
25:1:002:0	She sobs through the night ; tears stream down her cheeks.Among all her lovers , there is no one left to comfort her.All her friends have betrayed herand become her enemies .
25:1:003:0	Judah has been led away into captivity , oppressed with cruel slavery.She lives among foreign nationsand has no place of rest.Her enemies have chased her down , and she has nowhere to turn .
25:1:004:0	The roads to Jerusalem are in mourning , for crowds no longer come to celebrate the festivals.The city gates are silent , her priests groan , her young women are crying—how bitter is her fate !
25:1:005:0	Her oppressors have become her masters , and her enemies prosper , for the Lord has punished Jerusalemfor her many sins.Her children have been capturedand taken away to distant lands .
25:1:006:0	All the majesty of beautiful Jerusalemhas been stripped away.Her princes are like starving deersearching for pasture.They are too weak to runfrom the pursuing enemy .
25:1:007:0	In the midst of her sadness and wandering , Jerusalem remembers her ancient splendor.But now she has fallen to her enemy , and there is no one to help her.Her enemy struck her downand laughed as she fell .
25:1:008:0	Jerusalem has sinned greatly , so she has been tossed away like a filthy rag.All who once honored her now despise her , for they have seen her stripped naked and humiliated.All she can do is groanand hide her face .
25:1:009:0	She defiled herself with immoralityand gave no thought to her future.Now she lies in the gutterwith no one to lift her out. “ Lord , see my misery , ” she cries. “ The enemy has triumphed . ”
25:1:010:0	The enemy has plundered her completely , taking every precious thing she owns.She has seen foreigners violate her sacred Temple , the place the Lord had forbidden them to enter .
25:1:011:0	Her people groan as they search for bread.They have sold their treasures for food to stay alive. “ O Lord , look , ” she mourns , “ and see how I am despised .
25:1:012:0	“ Does it mean nothing to you , all you who pass by ? Look around and see if there is any suffering like mine , which the Lord brought on mewhen he erupted in fierce anger .
25:1:013:0	“ He has sent fire from heaven that burns in my bones.He has placed a trap in my path and turned me back.He has left me devastated , racked with sickness all day long .
25:1:014:0	“ He wove my sins into ropesto hitch me to a yoke of captivity.The Lord sapped my strength and turned me over to my enemies ; I am helpless in their hands .
25:1:015:0	“ The Lord has treated my mighty menwith contempt.At his command a great army has cometo crush my young warriors.The Lord has trampled his beloved citylike grapes are trampled in a winepress .
25:1:016:0	“ For all these things I weep ; tears flow down my cheeks.No one is here to comfort me ; any who might encourage me are far away.My children have no future , for the enemy has conquered us . ”
25:1:017:0	Jerusalem reaches out for help , but no one comforts her.Regarding his people Israel , the Lord has said , “ Let their neighbors be their enemies ! Let them be thrown away like a filthy rag ! ”
25:1:018:0	“ The Lord is right , ” Jerusalem says , “ for I rebelled against him.Listen , people everywhere ; look upon my anguish and despair , for my sons and daughtershave been taken captive to distant lands .
25:1:019:0	“ I begged my allies for help , but they betrayed me.My priests and leadersstarved to death in the city , even as they searched for foodto save their lives .
25:1:020:0	“ Lord , see my anguish ! My heart is brokenand my soul despairs , for I have rebelled against you.In the streets the sword kills , and at home there is only death .
25:1:021:0	“ Others heard my groans , but no one turned to comfort me.When my enemies heard about my troubles , they were happy to see what you had done.Oh , bring the day you promised , when they will suffer as I have suffered .
25:1:022:0	“ Look at all their evil deeds , Lord.Punish them , as you have punished mefor all my sins.My groans are many , and I am sick at heart . ”
