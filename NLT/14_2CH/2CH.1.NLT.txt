14:1:001:1	Solomon Asks for Wisdom
14:1:001:0	Solomon son of David took firm control of his kingdom , for the Lord his God was with him and made him very powerful .
14:1:002:0	Solomon called together all the leaders of Israel—the generals and captains of the army , the judges , and all the political and clan leaders .
14:1:003:0	Then he led the entire assembly to the place of worship in Gibeon , for God 's Tabernacle was located there . ( This was the Tabernacle that Moses , the Lord 's servant , had made in the wilderness . )
14:1:004:0	David had already moved the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he had prepared for it in Jerusalem .
14:1:005:0	But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur was there at Gibeon in front of the Tabernacle of the Lord . So Solomon and the people gathered in front of it to consult the Lord .
14:1:006:0	There in front of the Tabernacle , Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the Lord 's presence and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on it .
14:1:007:0	That night God appeared to Solomon and said , “ What do you want ? Ask , and I will give it to you ! ”
14:1:008:0	Solomon replied to God , “ You showed great and faithful love to David , my father , and now you have made me king in his place .
14:1:009:0	O Lord God , please continue to keep your promise to David my father , for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth !
14:1:010:0	Give me the wisdom and knowledge to lead them properly , for who could possibly govern this great people of yours ? ”
14:1:011:0	God said to Solomon , “ Because your greatest desire is to help your people , and you did not ask for wealth , riches , fame , or even the death of your enemies or a long life , but rather you asked for wisdom and knowledge to properly govern my people—
14:1:012:0	I will certainly give you the wisdom and knowledge you requested . But I will also give you wealth , riches , and fame such as no other king has had before you or will ever have in the future ! ”
14:1:013:0	Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the Tabernacle at the place of worship in Gibeon , and he reigned over Israel .
14:1:014:0	Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses . He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses . He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem .
14:1:015:0	The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone . And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah .
14:1:016:0	Solomon 's horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia ; the king 's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price .
14:1:017:0	At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver , and horses for 150 pieces of silver . They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram .
