14:22:001:1	Ahaziah Rules in Judah
14:22:001:0	Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah , Jehoram 's youngest son , their next king , since the marauding bands who came with the Arabs had killed all the older sons . So Ahaziah son of Jehoram reigned as king of Judah .
14:22:002:0	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem one year . His mother was Athaliah , a granddaughter of King Omri .
14:22:003:0	Ahaziah also followed the evil example of King Ahab 's family , for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong .
14:22:004:0	He did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , just as Ahab 's family had done . They even became his advisers after the death of his father , and they led him to ruin .
14:22:005:0	Following their evil advice , Ahaziah joined Joram , the son of King Ahab of Israel , in his war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead . When the Arameans wounded Joram in the battle ,
14:22:006:0	he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received at Ramoth . Because Joram was wounded , King Ahaziah of Judah went to Jezreel to visit him .
14:22:007:0	But God had decided that this visit would be Ahaziah 's downfall . While he was there , Ahaziah went out with Joram to meet Jehu grandson of Nimshi , whom the Lord had appointed to destroy the dynasty of Ahab .
14:22:008:0	While Jehu was executing judgment against the family of Ahab , he happened to meet some of Judah 's officials and Ahaziah 's relatives who were traveling with Ahaziah . So Jehu killed them all .

14:22:009:0	Then Jehu 's men searched for Ahaziah , and they found him hiding in the city of Samaria . They brought him to Jehu , who killed him . Ahaziah was given a decent burial because the people said , “ He was the grandson of Jehoshaphat — a man who sought the Lord with all his heart. ” But none of the surviving members of Ahaziah 's family was capable of ruling the kingdom .
14:22:010:0	When Athaliah , the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah , learned that her son was dead , she began to destroy the rest of Judah 's royal family .
14:22:011:0	But Ahaziah 's sister Jehosheba , the daughter of King Jehoram , took Ahaziah 's infant son , Joash , and stole him away from among the rest of the king 's children , who were about to be killed . She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom . In this way , Jehosheba , wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah , hid the child so that Athaliah could not murder him .
14:22:012:0	Joash remained hidden in the Temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land .
