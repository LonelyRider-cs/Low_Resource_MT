14:25:001:1	Amaziah Rules in Judah
14:25:001:0	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years . His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem .
14:25:002:0	Amaziah did what was pleasing in the Lord 's sight , but not wholeheartedly .
14:25:003:0	When Amaziah was well established as king , he executed the officials who had assassinated his father .
14:25:004:0	However , he did not kill the children of the assassins , for he obeyed the command of the Lord as written by Moses in the Book of the Law : “ Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children , nor children for the sins of their parents . Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes . ”
14:25:005:0	Then Amaziah organized the army , assigning generals and captains for all Judah and Benjamin . He took a census and found that he had an army of 300,000 select troops , twenty years old and older , all trained in the use of spear and shield .
14:25:006:0	He also paid about 7,500 pounds of silver to hire 100,000 experienced fighting men from Israel .
14:25:007:0	But a man of God came to him and said , “ Your Majesty , do not hire troops from Israel , for the Lord is not with Israel . He will not help those people of Ephraim !
14:25:008:0	If you let them go with your troops into battle , you will be defeated by the enemy no matter how well you fight . God will overthrow you , for he has the power to help you or to trip you up . ”
14:25:009:0	Amaziah asked the man of God , “ But what about all that silver I paid to hire the army of Israel ? ” The man of God replied , “ The Lord is able to give you much more than this ! ”
14:25:010:0	So Amaziah discharged the hired troops and sent them back to Ephraim . This made them very angry with Judah , and they returned home in a great rage .
14:25:011:0	Then Amaziah summoned his courage and led his army to the Valley of Salt , where they killed 10,000 Edomite troops from Seir .
14:25:012:0	They captured another 10,000 and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them off , dashing them to pieces on the rocks below .
14:25:013:0	Meanwhile , the hired troops that Amaziah had sent home raided several of the towns of Judah between Samaria and Beth-horon . They killed 3,000 people and carried off great quantities of plunder .
14:25:014:0	When King Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites , he brought with him idols taken from the people of Seir . He set them up as his own gods , bowed down in front of them , and offered sacrifices to them !
14:25:015:0	This made the Lord very angry , and he sent a prophet to ask , “ Why do you turn to gods who could not even save their own people from you ? ”
14:25:016:0	But the king interrupted him and said , “ Since when have I made you the king 's counselor ? Be quiet now before I have you killed ! ” So the prophet stopped with this warning : “ I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have refused to accept my counsel . ”
14:25:017:0	After consulting with his advisers , King Amaziah of Judah sent this challenge to Israel 's king Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu : “ Come and meet me in battle ! ”
14:25:018:0	But King Jehoash of Israel replied to King Amaziah of Judah with this story : “ Out in the Lebanon mountains , a thistle sent a message to a mighty cedar tree : ‘ Give your daughter in marriage to my son . ' But just then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and stepped on the thistle , crushing it !
14:25:019:0	“ You are saying , ‘ I have defeated Edom , ' and you are very proud of it . But my advice is to stay at home . Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and the people of Judah ? ”
14:25:020:0	But Amaziah refused to listen , for God was determined to destroy him for turning to the gods of Edom .
14:25:021:0	So King Jehoash of Israel mobilized his army against King Amaziah of Judah . The two armies drew up their battle lines at Beth-shemesh in Judah .
14:25:022:0	Judah was routed by the army of Israel , and its army scattered and fled for home .
14:25:023:0	King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah 's king , Amaziah son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah , at Beth-shemesh . Then he brought him to Jerusalem , where he demolished 600 feet of Jerusalem 's wall , from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate .
14:25:024:0	He carried off all the gold and silver and all the articles from the Temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-edom . He also seized the treasures of the royal palace , along with hostages , and then returned to Samaria .
14:25:025:0	King Amaziah of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of King Jehoash of Israel .
14:25:026:0	The rest of the events in Amaziah 's reign , from beginning to end , are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
14:25:027:0	After Amaziah turned away from the Lord , there was a conspiracy against his life in Jerusalem , and he fled to Lachish . But his enemies sent assassins after him , and they killed him there .
14:25:028:0	They brought his body back on a horse , and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David .
