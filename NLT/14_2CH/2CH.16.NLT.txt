14:16:001:1	Final Years of Asa 's Reign
14:16:001:0	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa 's reign , King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from entering or leaving King Asa 's territory in Judah .
14:16:002:0	Asa responded by removing the silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple of the Lord and the royal palace . He sent it to King Ben-hadad of Aram , who was ruling in Damascus , along with this message :
14:16:003:0	“ Let there be a treaty between you and me like the one between your father and my father . See , I am sending you silver and gold . Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone . ”
14:16:004:0	Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa 's request and sent the commanders of his army to attack the towns of Israel . They conquered the towns of Ijon , Dan , Abel-beth-maacah , and all the store cities in Naphtali .
14:16:005:0	As soon as Baasha of Israel heard what was happening , he abandoned his project of fortifying Ramah and stopped all work on it .
14:16:006:0	Then King Asa called out all the men of Judah to carry away the building stones and timbers that Baasha had been using to fortify Ramah . Asa used these materials to fortify the towns of Geba and Mizpah .
14:16:007:0	At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa and told him , “ Because you have put your trust in the king of Aram instead of in the Lord your God , you missed your chance to destroy the army of the king of Aram .
14:16:008:0	Do n't you remember what happened to the Ethiopians and Libyans and their vast army , with all of their chariots and charioteers ? At that time you relied on the Lord , and he handed them over to you .
14:16:009:0	The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him . What a fool you have been ! From now on you will be at war . ”
14:16:002:1	Summary of Asa 's Reign
14:16:010:0	Asa became so angry with Hanani for saying this that he threw him into prison and put him in stocks . At that time Asa also began to oppress some of his people .
14:16:011:0	The rest of the events of Asa 's reign , from beginning to end , are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel .
14:16:012:0	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign , Asa developed a serious foot disease . Yet even with the severity of his disease , he did not seek the Lord 's help but turned only to his physicians .
14:16:013:0	So he died in the forty-first year of his reign .
14:16:014:0	He was buried in the tomb he had carved out for himself in the City of David . He was laid on a bed perfumed with sweet spices and fragrant ointments , and the people built a huge funeral fire in his honor .
