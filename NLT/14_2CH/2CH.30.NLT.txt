14:30:001:1	Preparations for Passover
14:30:001:0	King Hezekiah now sent word to all Israel and Judah , and he wrote letters of invitation to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh . He asked everyone to come to the Temple of the Lord at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord , the God of Israel .
14:30:002:0	The king , his officials , and all the community of Jerusalem decided to celebrate Passover a month later than usual .
14:30:003:0	They were unable to celebrate it at the prescribed time because not enough priests could be purified by then , and the people had not yet assembled at Jerusalem .
14:30:004:0	This plan for keeping the Passover seemed right to the king and all the people .
14:30:005:0	So they sent a proclamation throughout all Israel , from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north , inviting everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord , the God of Israel . The people had not been celebrating it in great numbers as required in the Law .
14:30:006:0	At the king 's command , runners were sent throughout Israel and Judah . They carried letters that said : “ O people of Israel , return to the Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , so that he will return to the few of us who have survived the conquest of the Assyrian kings .
14:30:007:0	Do not be like your ancestors and relatives who abandoned the Lord , the God of their ancestors , and became an object of derision , as you yourselves can see .
14:30:008:0	Do not be stubborn , as they were , but submit yourselves to the Lord . Come to his Temple , which he has set apart as holy forever . Worship the Lord your God so that his fierce anger will turn away from you .
14:30:002:1	Celebration of Passover
14:30:009:0	“ For if you return to the Lord , your relatives and your children will be treated mercifully by their captors , and they will be able to return to this land . For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful . If you return to him , he will not continue to turn his face from you . ”
14:30:010:0	The runners went from town to town throughout Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as the territory of Zebulun . But most of the people just laughed at the runners and made fun of them .
14:30:011:0	However , some people from Asher , Manasseh , and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem .
14:30:012:0	At the same time , God 's hand was on the people in the land of Judah , giving them all one heart to obey the orders of the king and his officials , who were following the word of the Lord .
14:30:013:0	So a huge crowd assembled at Jerusalem in midspring to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread .
14:30:014:0	They set to work and removed the pagan altars from Jerusalem . They took away all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley .
14:30:015:0	On the fourteenth day of the second month , one month later than usual , the people slaughtered the Passover lamb . This shamed the priests and Levites , so they purified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the Temple of the Lord .
14:30:016:0	Then they took their places at the Temple as prescribed in the Law of Moses , the man of God . The Levites brought the sacrificial blood to the priests , who then sprinkled it on the altar .
14:30:017:0	Since many of the people had not purified themselves , the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them , to set them apart for the Lord .
14:30:018:0	Most of those who came from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun had not purified themselves . But King Hezekiah prayed for them , and they were allowed to eat the Passover meal anyway , even though this was contrary to the requirements of the Law . For Hezekiah said , “ May the Lord , who is good , pardon those
14:30:019:0	who decide to follow the Lord , the God of their ancestors , even though they are not properly cleansed for the ceremony . ”
14:30:020:0	And the Lord listened to Hezekiah 's prayer and healed the people .
14:30:021:0	So the people of Israel who were present in Jerusalem joyously celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days . Each day the Levites and priests sang to the Lord , accompanied by loud instruments .
14:30:022:0	Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites regarding the skill they displayed as they served the Lord . The celebration continued for seven days . Peace offerings were sacrificed , and the people gave thanks to the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
14:30:023:0	The entire assembly then decided to continue the festival another seven days , so they celebrated joyfully for another week .
14:30:024:0	King Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats for offerings , and the officials donated 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats . Meanwhile , many more priests purified themselves .
14:30:025:0	The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced , including the priests , the Levites , all who came from the land of Israel , the foreigners who came to the festival , and all those who lived in Judah .
14:30:026:0	There was great joy in the city , for Jerusalem had not seen a celebration like this one since the days of Solomon , King David 's son .
14:30:027:0	Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people , and God heard their prayer from his holy dwelling in heaven .
