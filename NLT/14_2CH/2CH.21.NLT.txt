14:21:001:1	Jehoram Rules in Judah
14:21:001:0	When Jehoshaphat died , he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David . Then his son Jehoram became the next king .
14:21:002:0	Jehoram 's brothers — the other sons of Jehoshaphat — were Azariah , Jehiel , Zechariah , Azariahu , Michael , and Shephatiah ; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Judah .
14:21:003:0	Their father had given each of them valuable gifts of silver , gold , and costly items , and also some of Judah 's fortified towns . However , he designated Jehoram as the next king because he was the oldest .
14:21:004:0	But when Jehoram had become solidly established as king , he killed all his brothers and some of the other leaders of Judah .
14:21:005:0	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years .
14:21:006:0	But Jehoram followed the example of the kings of Israel and was as wicked as King Ahab , for he had married one of Ahab 's daughters . So Jehoram did what was evil in the Lord 's sight .
14:21:007:0	But the Lord did not want to destroy David 's dynasty , for he had made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would continue to rule , shining like a lamp forever .
14:21:008:0	During Jehoram 's reign , the Edomites revolted against Judah and crowned their own king .
14:21:009:0	So Jehoram went out with his full army and all his chariots . The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders , but he went out at night and attacked them under cover of darkness .
14:21:010:0	Even so , Edom has been independent from Judah to this day . The town of Libnah also revolted about that same time . All this happened because Jehoram had abandoned the Lord , the God of his ancestors .
14:21:011:0	He had built pagan shrines in the hill country of Judah and had led the people of Jerusalem and Judah to give themselves to pagan gods and to go astray .
14:21:012:0	Then Elijah the prophet wrote Jehoram this letter : “ This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : You have not followed the good example of your father , Jehoshaphat , or your grandfather King Asa of Judah .
14:21:013:0	Instead , you have been as evil as the kings of Israel . You have led the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship idols , just as King Ahab did in Israel . And you have even killed your own brothers , men who were better than you .
14:21:014:0	So now the Lord is about to strike you , your people , your children , your wives , and all that is yours with a heavy blow .
14:21:015:0	You yourself will suffer with a severe intestinal disease that will get worse each day until your bowels come out . ”
14:21:016:0	Then the Lord stirred up the Philistines and the Arabs , who lived near the Ethiopians , to attack Jehoram .
14:21:017:0	They marched against Judah , broke down its defenses , and carried away everything of value in the royal palace , including the king 's sons and his wives . Only his youngest son , Ahaziah , was spared .
14:21:018:0	After all this , the Lord struck Jehoram with an incurable intestinal disease .
14:21:019:0	The disease grew worse and worse , and at the end of two years it caused his bowels to come out , and he died in agony . His people did not build a great funeral fire to honor him as they had done for his ancestors .
14:21:020:0	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years . No one was sorry when he died . They buried him in the City of David , but not in the royal cemetery .
