14:9:001:1	Visit of the Queen of Sheba
14:9:001:0	When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon 's fame , she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions . She arrived with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices , large quantities of gold , and precious jewels . When she met with Solomon , she talked with him about everything she had on her mind .
14:9:002:0	Solomon had answers for all her questions ; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her .
14:9:003:0	When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was , and when she saw the palace he had built ,
14:9:004:0	she was overwhelmed . She was also amazed at the food on his tables , the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing , the cup-bearers and their robes , and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the Lord .
14:9:005:0	She exclaimed to the king , “ Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true !
14:9:006:0	I did n't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes . In fact , I had not heard the half of your great wisdom ! It is far beyond what I was told .
14:9:007:0	How happy your people must be ! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day , listening to your wisdom !
14:9:008:0	Praise the Lord your God , who delights in you and has placed you on the throne as king to rule for him . Because God loves Israel and desires this kingdom to last forever , he has made you king over them so you can rule with justice and righteousness . ”
14:9:009:0	Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds of gold , great quantities of spices , and precious jewels . Never before had there been spices as fine as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
14:9:010:0	( In addition , the crews of Hiram and Solomon brought gold from Ophir , and they also brought red sandalwood and precious jewels .
14:9:011:0	The king used the sandalwood to make steps for the Temple of the Lord and the royal palace , and to construct lyres and harps for the musicians . Never before had such beautiful things been seen in Judah . )
14:9:002:1	Solomon 's Wealth and Splendor
14:9:012:0	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for — gifts of greater value than the gifts she had given him . Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land .
14:9:013:0	Each year Solomon received about 25 tons of gold .
14:9:014:0	This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders . All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the provinces also brought gold and silver to Solomon .
14:9:015:0	King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold , each weighing more than 15 pounds .
14:9:016:0	He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold , each weighing more than 71/2 pounds . The king placed these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon .
14:9:017:0	Then the king made a huge throne , decorated with ivory and overlaid with pure gold .
14:9:018:0	The throne had six steps , with a footstool of gold . There were armrests on both sides of the seat , and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne .
14:9:019:0	There were also twelve other lions , one standing on each end of the six steps . No other throne in all the world could be compared with it !
14:9:020:0	All of King Solomon 's drinking cups were solid gold , as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon . They were not made of silver , for silver was considered worthless in Solomon 's day !
14:9:021:0	The king had a fleet of trading ships of Tarshish manned by the sailors sent by Hiram . Once every three years the ships returned , loaded with gold , silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks .
14:9:022:0	So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth .
14:9:023:0	Kings from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him .
14:9:024:0	Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold , clothing , weapons , spices , horses , and mules .
14:9:025:0	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots , and he had 12,000 horses . He stationed some of them in the chariot cities , and some near him in Jerusalem .
14:9:026:0	He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River in the north to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt in the south .
14:9:027:0	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone . And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah .
14:9:003:1	Summary of Solomon 's Reign
14:9:028:0	Solomon 's horses were imported from Egypt and many other countries .
14:9:029:0	The rest of the events of Solomon 's reign , from beginning to end , are recorded in The Record of Nathan the Prophet , and The Prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh , and also in The Visions of Iddo the Seer , concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat .
14:9:030:0	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years .
14:9:031:0	When he died , he was buried in the City of David , named for his father . Then his son Rehoboam became the next king .
