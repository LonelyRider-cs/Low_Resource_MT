14:34:001:1	Josiah Rules in Judah
14:34:001:0	Josiah was eight years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years .
14:34:002:0	He did what was pleasing in the Lord 's sight and followed the example of his ancestor David . He did not turn away from doing what was right .
14:34:003:0	During the eighth year of his reign , while he was still young , Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David . Then in the twelfth year he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem , destroying all the pagan shrines , the Asherah poles , and the carved idols and cast images .
14:34:004:0	He ordered that the altars of Baal be demolished and that the incense altars which stood above them be broken down . He also made sure that the Asherah poles , the carved idols , and the cast images were smashed and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them .
14:34:005:0	He burned the bones of the pagan priests on their own altars , and so he purified Judah and Jerusalem .
14:34:006:0	He did the same thing in the towns of Manasseh , Ephraim , and Simeon , even as far as Naphtali , and in the regions all around them .
14:34:007:0	He destroyed the pagan altars and the Asherah poles , and he crushed the idols into dust . He cut down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel . Finally , he returned to Jerusalem .
14:34:008:0	In the eighteenth year of his reign , after he had purified the land and the Temple , Josiah appointed Shaphan son of Azaliah , Maaseiah the governor of Jerusalem , and Joah son of Joahaz , the royal historian , to repair the Temple of the Lord his God .
14:34:009:0	They gave Hilkiah the high priest the money that had been collected by the Levites who served as gatekeepers at the Temple of God . The gifts were brought by people from Manasseh , Ephraim , and from all the remnant of Israel , as well as from all Judah , Benjamin , and the people of Jerusalem .
14:34:010:0	He entrusted the money to the men assigned to supervise the restoration of the Lord 's Temple . Then they paid the workers who did the repairs and renovation of the Temple .
14:34:011:0	They hired carpenters and builders , who purchased finished stone for the walls and timber for the rafters and beams . They restored what earlier kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin .
14:34:012:0	The workers served faithfully under the leadership of Jahath and Obadiah , Levites of the Merarite clan , and Zechariah and Meshullam , Levites of the Kohathite clan . Other Levites , all of whom were skilled musicians ,

14:34:013:0	were put in charge of the laborers of the various trades . Still others assisted as secretaries , officials , and gatekeepers .
14:34:014:0	While they were bringing out the money collected at the Lord 's Temple , Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that was written by Moses .
14:34:015:0	Hilkiah said to Shaphan the court secretary , “ I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord 's Temple ! ” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan .
14:34:016:0	Shaphan took the scroll to the king and reported , “ Your officials are doing everything they were assigned to do .
14:34:017:0	The money that was collected at the Temple of the Lord has been turned over to the supervisors and workmen . ”
14:34:018:0	Shaphan also told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll. ” So Shaphan read it to the king .
14:34:019:0	When the king heard what was written in the Law , he tore his clothes in despair .
14:34:020:0	Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Acbor son of Micaiah , Shaphan the court secretary , and Asaiah the king 's personal adviser :
14:34:021:0	“ Go to the Temple and speak to the Lord for me and for all the remnant of Israel and Judah . Inquire about the words written in the scroll that has been found . For the Lord 's great anger has been poured out on us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the Lord . We have not been doing everything this scroll says we must do . ”
14:34:022:0	So Hilkiah and the other men went to the New Quarter of Jerusalem to consult with the prophet Huldah . She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah , son of Harhas , the keeper of the Temple wardrobe .
14:34:023:0	She said to them , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , has spoken ! Go back and tell the man who sent you ,
14:34:024:0	‘ This is what the Lord says : I am going to bring disaster on this city and its people . All the curses written in the scroll that was read to the king of Judah will come true .
14:34:025:0	For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods , and I am very angry with them for everything they have done . My anger will be poured out on this place , and it will not be quenched . '
14:34:026:0	“ But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the Lord and tell him : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says concerning the message you have just heard :
14:34:027:0	You were sorry and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this city and its people . You humbled yourself and tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance . And I have indeed heard you , says the Lord .
14:34:003:1	Josiah 's Religious Reforms
14:34:028:0	So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace . You yourself will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city and its people . ' ” So they took her message back to the king .
14:34:029:0	Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
14:34:030:0	And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem , along with the priests and the Levites — all the people from the greatest to the least . There the king read to them the entire Book of the Covenant that had been found in the Lord 's Temple .
14:34:031:0	The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the Lord 's presence . He pledged to obey the Lord by keeping all his commands , laws , and decrees with all his heart and soul . He promised to obey all the terms of the covenant that were written in the scroll .
14:34:032:0	And he required everyone in Jerusalem and the people of Benjamin to make a similar pledge . The people of Jerusalem did so , renewing their covenant with God , the God of their ancestors .
14:34:033:0	So Josiah removed all detestable idols from the entire land of Israel and required everyone to worship the Lord their God . And throughout the rest of his lifetime , they did not turn away from the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
