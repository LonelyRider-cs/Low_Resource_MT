14:23:001:1	Revolt against Athaliah
14:23:001:0	In the seventh year of Athaliah 's reign , Jehoiada the priest decided to act . He summoned his courage and made a pact with five army commanders : Azariah son of Jeroham , Ishmael son of Jehohanan , Azariah son of Obed , Maaseiah son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat son of Zicri .
14:23:002:0	These men traveled secretly throughout Judah and summoned the Levites and clan leaders in all the towns to come to Jerusalem .
14:23:003:0	They all gathered at the Temple of God , where they made a solemn pact with Joash , the young king.Jehoiada said to them , “ Here is the king 's son ! The time has come for him to reign ! The Lord has promised that a descendant of David will be our king .
14:23:004:0	This is what you must do . When you priests and Levites come on duty on the Sabbath , a third of you will serve as gatekeepers .
14:23:005:0	Another third will go over to the royal palace , and the final third will be at the Foundation Gate . Everyone else should stay in the courtyards of the Lord 's Temple .
14:23:006:0	Remember , only the priests and Levites on duty may enter the Temple of the Lord , for they are set apart as holy . The rest of the people must obey the Lord 's instructions and stay outside .
14:23:007:0	You Levites , form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand . Kill anyone who tries to enter the Temple . Stay with the king wherever he goes . ”
14:23:008:0	So the Levites and all the people of Judah did everything as Jehoiada the priest ordered . The commanders took charge of the men reporting for duty that Sabbath , as well as those who were going off duty . Jehoiada the priest did not let anyone go home after their shift ended .
14:23:009:0	Then Jehoiada supplied the commanders with the spears and the large and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of God .
14:23:010:0	He stationed all the people around the king , with their weapons ready . They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar .
14:23:002:1	The Death of Athaliah
14:23:011:0	Then Jehoiada and his sons brought out Joash , the king 's son , placed the crown on his head , and presented him with a copy of God 's laws . They anointed him and proclaimed him king , and everyone shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
14:23:012:0	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and the shouts of praise to the king , she hurried to the Lord 's Temple to see what was happening .
14:23:013:0	When she arrived , she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar at the Temple entrance . The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him , and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets . Singers with musical instruments were leading the people in a great celebration . When Athaliah saw all this , she tore her clothes in despair and shouted , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
14:23:014:0	Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops , “ Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple , and kill anyone who tries to rescue her. ” For the priest had said , “ She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord . ”
14:23:003:1	Jehoiada 's Religious Reforms
14:23:015:0	So they seized her and led her out to the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds , and they killed her there .
14:23:016:0	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and the king and the people that they would be the Lord 's people .
14:23:017:0	And all the people went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down . They demolished the altars and smashed the idols , and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars .
14:23:018:0	Jehoiada now put the priests and Levites in charge of the Temple of the Lord , following all the directions given by David . He also commanded them to present burnt offerings to the Lord , as prescribed by the Law of Moses , and to sing and rejoice as David had instructed .
14:23:019:0	He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the Lord 's Temple to keep out those who for any reason were ceremonially unclean .
14:23:020:0	Then the commanders , nobles , rulers , and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the Lord . They went through the upper gate and into the palace , and they seated the king on the royal throne .
14:23:021:0	So all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed .
