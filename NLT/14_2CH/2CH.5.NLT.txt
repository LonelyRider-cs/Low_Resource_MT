14:5:001:1	The Ark Brought to the Temple
14:5:001:0	So Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the Lord . Then he brought all the gifts his father , David , had dedicated—the silver , the gold , and the various articles—and he stored them in the treasuries of the Temple of God .
14:5:002:0	Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of tribes—the leaders of the ancestral families of Israel . They were to bring the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant to the Temple from its location in the City of David , also known as Zion .
14:5:003:0	So all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the annual Festival of Shelters , which is held in early autumn .
14:5:004:0	When all the elders of Israel arrived , the Levites picked up the Ark .
14:5:005:0	The priests and Levites brought up the Ark along with the special tent and all the sacred items that had been in it .
14:5:006:0	There , before the Ark , King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep , goats , and cattle that no one could keep count !
14:5:007:0	Then the priests carried the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant into the inner sanctuary of the Temple—the Most Holy Place—and placed it beneath the wings of the cherubim .
14:5:008:0	The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark , forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles .
14:5:009:0	These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place , which is in front of the Most Holy Place , but not from the outside . They are still there to this day .
14:5:010:0	Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai , where the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel when they left Egypt .
14:5:011:0	Then the priests left the Holy Place . All the priests who were present had purified themselves , whether or not they were on duty that day .
14:5:012:0	And the Levites who were musicians—Asaph , Heman , Jeduthun , and all their sons and brothers—were dressed in fine linen robes and stood at the east side of the altar playing cymbals , lyres , and harps . They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets .
14:5:013:0	The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the Lord . Accompanied by trumpets , cymbals , and other instruments , they raised their voices and praised the Lord with these words : “ He is good ! His faithful love endures forever ! ” At that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the Lord .
14:5:014:0	The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud , for the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple of God .
