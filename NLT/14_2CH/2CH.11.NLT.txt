14:11:001:1	Shemaiah 's Prophecy
14:11:001:0	When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem , he mobilized the men of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 select troops—to fight against Israel and to restore the kingdom to himself .
14:11:002:0	But the Lord said to Shemaiah , the man of God ,
14:11:003:0	“ Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin :
14:11:002:1	Rehoboam Fortifies Judah
14:11:004:0	‘ This is what the Lord says : Do not fight against your relatives . Go back home , for what has happened is my doing ! ' ” So they obeyed the message of the Lord and did not fight against Jeroboam .
14:11:005:0	Rehoboam remained in Jerusalem and fortified various towns for the defense of Judah .
14:11:006:0	He built up Bethlehem , Etam , Tekoa ,
14:11:007:0	Beth-zur , Soco , Adullam ,
14:11:008:0	Gath , Mareshah , Ziph ,
14:11:009:0	Adoraim , Lachish , Azekah ,
14:11:010:0	Zorah , Aijalon , and Hebron . These became the fortified towns of Judah and Benjamin .
14:11:011:0	Rehoboam strengthened their defenses and stationed commanders in them , and he stored supplies of food , olive oil , and wine .
14:11:012:0	He also put shields and spears in these towns as a further safety measure . So only Judah and Benjamin remained under his control .
14:11:013:0	But all the priests and Levites living among the northern tribes of Israel sided with Rehoboam .
14:11:014:0	The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and moved to Judah and Jerusalem , because Jeroboam and his sons would not allow them to serve the Lord as priests .
14:11:015:0	Jeroboam appointed his own priests to serve at the pagan shrines , where they worshiped the goat and calf idols he had made .
14:11:016:0	From all the tribes of Israel , those who sincerely wanted to worship the Lord , the God of Israel , followed the Levites to Jerusalem , where they could offer sacrifices to the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
14:11:003:1	Rehoboam 's Family
14:11:017:0	This strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and for three years they supported Rehoboam son of Solomon , for during those years they faithfully followed in the footsteps of David and Solomon .
14:11:018:0	Rehoboam married his cousin Mahalath , the daughter of David 's son Jerimoth and of Abihail , the daughter of Eliab son of Jesse .
14:11:019:0	Mahalath had three sons—Jeush , Shemariah , and Zaham .
14:11:020:0	Later Rehoboam married another cousin , Maacah , the granddaughter of Absalom . Maacah gave birth to Abijah , Attai , Ziza , and Shelomith .
14:11:021:0	Rehoboam loved Maacah more than any of his other wives and concubines . In all , he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines , and they gave birth to twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters .
14:11:022:0	Rehoboam appointed Maacah 's son Abijah as leader among the princes , making it clear that he would be the next king .
14:11:023:0	Rehoboam also wisely gave responsibilities to his other sons and stationed some of them in the fortified towns throughout the land of Judah and Benjamin . He provided them with generous provisions , and he found many wives for them .
