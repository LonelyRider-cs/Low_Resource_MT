14:10:001:1	The Northern Tribes Revolt
14:10:001:0	Rehoboam went to Shechem , where all Israel had gathered to make him king .
14:10:002:0	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this , he returned from Egypt , for he had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon .
14:10:003:0	The leaders of Israel summoned him , and Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak with Rehoboam .
14:10:004:0	“ Your father was a hard master , ” they said . “ Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us . Then we will be your loyal subjects . ”
14:10:005:0	Rehoboam replied , “ Come back in three days for my answer. ” So the people went away .
14:10:006:0	Then King Rehoboam discussed the matter with the older men who had counseled his father , Solomon . “ What is your advice ? ” he asked . “ How should I answer these people ? ”
14:10:007:0	The older counselors replied , “ If you are good to these people and do your best to please them and give them a favorable answer , they will always be your loyal subjects . ”
14:10:008:0	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisers .
14:10:009:0	“ What is your advice ? ” he asked them . “ How should I answer these people who want me to lighten the burdens imposed by my father ? ”
14:10:010:0	The young men replied , “ This is what you should tell those complainers who want a lighter burden : ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist !
14:10:011:0	Yes , my father laid heavy burdens on you , but I 'm going to make them even heavier ! My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with scorpions ! ' ”
14:10:012:0	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to hear Rehoboam 's decision , just as the king had ordered .
14:10:013:0	But Rehoboam spoke harshly to them , for he rejected the advice of the older counselors
14:10:014:0	and followed the counsel of his younger advisers . He told the people , “ My father laid heavy burdens on you , but I 'm going to make them even heavier ! My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with scorpions ! ”
14:10:015:0	So the king paid no attention to the people . This turn of events was the will of God , for it fulfilled the Lord 's message to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh .
14:10:016:0	When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them , they responded , “ Down with the dynasty of David ! We have no interest in the son of Jesse.Back to your homes , O Israel ! Look out for your own house , O David ! ” So all the people of Israel returned home .
14:10:017:0	But Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah .
14:10:018:0	King Rehoboam sent Adoniram , who was in charge of forced labor , to restore order , but the people of Israel stoned him to death . When this news reached King Rehoboam , he quickly jumped into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem .
14:10:019:0	And to this day the northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David .
