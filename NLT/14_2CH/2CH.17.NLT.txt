14:17:001:0	Then Jehoshaphat , Asa 's son , became the next king . He strengthened Judah to stand against any attack from Israel .
14:17:002:0	He stationed troops in all the fortified towns of Judah , and he assigned additional garrisons to the land of Judah and to the towns of Ephraim that his father , Asa , had captured .
14:17:003:0	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father 's early years and did not worship the images of Baal .
14:17:004:0	He sought his father 's God and obeyed his commands instead of following the evil practices of the kingdom of Israel .
14:17:005:0	So the Lord established Jehoshaphat 's control over the kingdom of Judah . All the people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat , so he became very wealthy and highly esteemed .
14:17:006:0	He was deeply committed to the ways of the Lord . He removed the pagan shrines and Asherah poles from Judah .

14:17:009:0	They took copies of the Book of the Law of the Lord and traveled around through all the towns of Judah , teaching the people .
14:17:010:0	Then the fear of the Lord fell over all the surrounding kingdoms so that none of them wanted to declare war on Jehoshaphat .
14:17:011:0	Some of the Philistines brought him gifts and silver as tribute , and the Arabs brought 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats .

14:17:014:0	His army was enrolled according to ancestral clans.From Judah there were 300,000 troops organized in units of 1,000 , under the command of Adnah .
14:17:015:0	Next in command was Jehohanan , who commanded 280,000 troops .
14:17:016:0	Next was Amasiah son of Zicri , who volunteered for the Lord 's service , with 200,000 troops under his command .
14:17:017:0	From Benjamin there were 200,000 troops equipped with bows and shields . They were under the command of Eliada , a veteran soldier .
