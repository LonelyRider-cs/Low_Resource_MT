14:14:001:1	Early Years of Asa 's Reign
14:14:001:0	When Abijah died , he was buried in the City of David . Then his son Asa became the next king . There was peace in the land for ten years .
14:14:002:0	Asa did what was pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord his God .
14:14:003:0	He removed the foreign altars and the pagan shrines . He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah poles .
14:14:004:0	He commanded the people of Judah to seek the Lord , the God of their ancestors , and to obey his law and his commands .
14:14:005:0	Asa also removed the pagan shrines , as well as the incense altars from every one of Judah 's towns . So Asa 's kingdom enjoyed a period of peace .
14:14:006:0	During those peaceful years , he was able to build up the fortified towns throughout Judah . No one tried to make war against him at this time , for the Lord was giving him rest from his enemies .
14:14:007:0	Asa told the people of Judah , “ Let us build towns and fortify them with walls , towers , gates , and bars . The land is still ours because we sought the Lord our God , and he has given us peace on every side. ” So they went ahead with these projects and brought them to completion .
14:14:008:0	King Asa had an army of 300,000 warriors from the tribe of Judah , armed with large shields and spears . He also had an army of 280,000 warriors from the tribe of Benjamin , armed with small shields and bows . Both armies were composed of well-trained fighting men .
14:14:009:0	Once an Ethiopian named Zerah attacked Judah with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots . They advanced to the town of Mareshah ,
14:14:010:0	so Asa deployed his armies for battle in the valley north of Mareshah .
14:14:011:0	Then Asa cried out to the Lord his God , “ O Lord , no one but you can help the powerless against the mighty ! Help us , O Lord our God , for we trust in you alone . It is in your name that we have come against this vast horde . O Lord , you are our God ; do not let mere men prevail against you ! ”
14:14:012:0	So the Lord defeated the Ethiopians in the presence of Asa and the army of Judah , and the enemy fled .
14:14:013:0	Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar , and so many Ethiopians fell that they were unable to rally . They were destroyed by the Lord and his army , and the army of Judah carried off a vast amount of plunder .
14:14:014:0	While they were at Gerar , they attacked all the towns in that area , and terror from the Lord came upon the people there . As a result , a vast amount of plunder was taken from these towns , too .
14:14:015:0	They also attacked the camps of herdsmen and captured many sheep , goats , and camels before finally returning to Jerusalem .
