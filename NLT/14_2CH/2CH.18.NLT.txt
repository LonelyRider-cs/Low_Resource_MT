14:18:001:1	Jehoshaphat and Ahab
14:18:001:0	Jehoshaphat enjoyed great riches and high esteem , and he made an alliance with Ahab of Israel by having his son marry Ahab 's daughter .
14:18:002:0	A few years later he went to Samaria to visit Ahab , who prepared a great banquet for him and his officials . They butchered great numbers of sheep , goats , and cattle for the feast . Then Ahab enticed Jehoshaphat to join forces with him to recover Ramoth-gilead .
14:18:003:0	“ Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead ? ” King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah.Jehoshaphat replied , “ Why , of course ! You and I are as one , and my troops are your troops . We will certainly join you in battle . ”
14:18:004:0	Then Jehoshaphat added , “ But first let 's find out what the Lord says . ”
14:18:005:0	So the king of Israel summoned the prophets , 400 of them , and asked them , “ Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead , or should I hold back ? ” They all replied , “ Yes , go right ahead ! God will give the king victory . ”
14:18:006:0	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here ? We should ask him the same question . ”
14:18:007:0	The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat , “ There is one more man who could consult the Lord for us , but I hate him . He never prophesies anything but trouble for me ! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah. ” Jehoshaphat replied , “ That 's not the way a king should talk ! Let 's hear what he has to say . ”
14:18:002:1	Micaiah Prophesies against Ahab
14:18:008:0	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said , “ Quick ! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah . ”
14:18:009:0	King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah , dressed in their royal robes , were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria . All of Ahab 's prophets were prophesying there in front of them .
14:18:010:0	One of them , Zedekiah son of Kenaanah , made some iron horns and proclaimed , “ This is what the Lord says : With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death ! ”
14:18:011:0	All the other prophets agreed . “ Yes , ” they said , “ go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious , for the Lord will give the king victory ! ”
14:18:012:0	Meanwhile , the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him , “ Look , all the prophets are promising victory for the king . Be sure that you agree with them and promise success . ”
14:18:013:0	But Micaiah replied , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I will say only what my God says . ”
14:18:014:0	When Micaiah arrived before the king , Ahab asked him , “ Micaiah , should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead , or should I hold back ? ” Micaiah replied sarcastically , “ Yes , go up and be victorious , for you will have victory over them ! ”
14:18:015:0	But the king replied sharply , “ How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the Lord ? ”
14:18:016:0	Then Micaiah told him , “ In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , like sheep without a shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ Their master has been killed . Send them home in peace . ' ”
14:18:017:0	“ Did n't I tell you ? ” the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat . “ He never prophesies anything but trouble for me . ”
14:18:018:0	Then Micaiah continued , “ Listen to what the Lord says ! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him , on his right and on his left .
14:18:019:0	And the Lord said , ‘ Who can entice King Ahab of Israel to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed ? ' “ There were many suggestions ,
14:18:020:0	and finally a spirit approached the Lord and said , ‘ I can do it ! ' “ ‘ How will you do this ? ' the Lord asked .
14:18:021:0	“ And the spirit replied , ‘ I will go out and inspire all of Ahab 's prophets to speak lies . ' “ ‘ You will succeed , ' said the Lord . ‘ Go ahead and do it . '
14:18:022:0	“ So you see , the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of your prophets . For the Lord has pronounced your doom . ”
14:18:023:0	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face . “ Since when did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you ? ” he demanded .
14:18:024:0	And Micaiah replied , “ You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room ! ”
14:18:025:0	“ Arrest him ! ” the king of Israel ordered . “ Take him back to Amon , the governor of the city , and to my son Joash .
14:18:026:0	Give them this order from the king : ‘ Put this man in prison , and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle ! ' ”
14:18:003:1	The Death of Ahab
14:18:027:0	But Micaiah replied , “ If you return safely , it will mean that the Lord has not spoken through me ! ” Then he added to those standing around , “ Everyone mark my words ! ”
14:18:028:0	So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead .
14:18:029:0	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ As we go into battle , I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me , but you wear your royal robes. ” So the king of Israel disguised himself , and they went into battle .
14:18:030:0	Meanwhile , the king of Aram had issued these orders to his chariot commanders : “ Attack only the king of Israel ! Do n't bother with anyone else . ”
14:18:031:0	So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes , they went after him . “ There is the king of Israel ! ” they shouted . But Jehoshaphat called out , and the Lord saved him . God helped him by turning the attackers away from him .
14:18:032:0	As soon as the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel , they stopped chasing him .
14:18:033:0	An Aramean soldier , however , randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor . “ Turn the horses and get me out of here ! ” Ahab groaned to the driver of the chariot . “ I 'm badly wounded ! ”
14:18:034:0	The battle raged all that day , and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans . In the evening , just as the sun was setting , he died .
