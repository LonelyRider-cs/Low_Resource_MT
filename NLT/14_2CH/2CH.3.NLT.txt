14:3:001:1	Solomon Builds the Temple
14:3:001:0	So Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah , where the Lord had appeared to David , his father . The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite , the site that David had selected .
14:3:002:0	The construction began in midspring , during the fourth year of Solomon 's reign .
14:3:003:0	These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God ( using the old standard of measurement ) . It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide .
14:3:004:0	The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet wide , running across the entire width of the Temple , and 30 feet high . He overlaid the inside with pure gold .
14:3:005:0	He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood , overlaid it with fine gold , and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains .
14:3:006:0	He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim .
14:3:007:0	He overlaid the beams , thresholds , walls , and doors throughout the Temple with gold , and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls .
14:3:008:0	He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide , corresponding to the width of the Temple , and 30 feet deep . He overlaid its interior with 23 tons of fine gold .
14:3:009:0	The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces each . He also overlaid the walls of the upper rooms with gold .
14:3:010:0	He made two figures shaped like cherubim , overlaid them with gold , and placed them in the Most Holy Place .
14:3:011:0	The total wingspan of the two cherubim standing side by side was 30 feet . One wing of the first figure was 71/2 feet long , and it touched the Temple wall . The other wing , also 71/2 feet long , touched one of the wings of the second figure .
14:3:012:0	In the same way , the second figure had one wing 71/2 feet long that touched the opposite wall . The other wing , also 71/2 feet long , touched the wing of the first figure .
14:3:013:0	So the wingspan of the two cherubim side by side was 30 feet . They stood on their feet and faced out toward the main room of the Temple .
14:3:014:0	Across the entrance of the Most Holy Place he hung a curtain made of fine linen , decorated with blue , purple , and scarlet thread and embroidered with figures of cherubim .
14:3:015:0	For the front of the Temple , he made two pillars that were 27 feet tall , each topped by a capital extending upward another 71/2 feet .
14:3:016:0	He made a network of interwoven chains and used them to decorate the tops of the pillars . He also made 100 decorative pomegranates and attached them to the chains .
14:3:017:0	Then he set up the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple , one to the south of the entrance and the other to the north . He named the one on the south Jakin , and the one on the north Boaz .
