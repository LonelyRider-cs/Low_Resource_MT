14:4:001:1	Furnishings for the Temple
14:4:001:0	Solomon also made a bronze altar 30 feet long , 30 feet wide , and 15 feet high .
14:4:002:0	Then he cast a great round basin , 15 feet across from rim to rim , called the Sea . It was 71/2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference .
14:4:003:0	It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of figures that resembled oxen . There were about six oxen per foot all the way around , and they were cast as part of the basin .
14:4:004:0	The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen , all facing outward . Three faced north , three faced west , three faced south , and three faced east , and the Sea rested on them .
14:4:005:0	The walls of the Sea were about three inches thick , and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom . It could hold about 16,500 gallons of water .
14:4:006:0	He also made ten smaller basins for washing the utensils for the burnt offerings . He set five on the south side and five on the north . But the priests washed themselves in the Sea .
14:4:007:0	He then cast ten gold lampstands according to the specifications that had been given , and he put them in the Temple . Five were placed against the south wall , and five were placed against the north wall .
14:4:008:0	He also built ten tables and placed them in the Temple , five along the south wall and five along the north wall . Then he molded 100 gold basins .
14:4:009:0	He then built a courtyard for the priests , and also the large outer courtyard . He made doors for the courtyard entrances and overlaid them with bronze .
14:4:010:0	The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple .
14:4:011:0	Huram-abi also made the necessary washbasins , shovels , and bowls.So at last Huram-abi completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of God :
14:4:012:0	the two pillars ; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars ; the two networks of interwoven chains that decorated the capitals ;
14:4:013:0	the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals ( two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars ) ;
14:4:014:0	the water carts holding the basins ;
14:4:015:0	the Sea and the twelve oxen under it ;
14:4:016:0	the ash buckets , the shovels , the meat hooks , and all the related articles.Huram-abi made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the Lord , just as King Solomon had directed .
14:4:017:0	The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan .
14:4:018:0	Solomon used such great quantities of bronze that its weight could not be determined .
14:4:019:0	Solomon also made all the furnishings for the Temple of God : the gold altar ; the tables for the Bread of the Presence ;
14:4:020:0	the lampstands and their lamps of solid gold , to burn in front of the Most Holy Place as prescribed ;
14:4:021:0	the flower decorations , lamps , and tongs — all of the purest gold ;
14:4:022:0	the lamp snuffers , bowls , ladles , and incense burners — all of solid gold ; the doors for the entrances to the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple , overlaid with gold .
