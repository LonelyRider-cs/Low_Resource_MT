14:7:001:1	The Dedication of the Temple
14:7:001:0	When Solomon finished praying , fire flashed down from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices , and the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple .
14:7:002:0	The priests could not enter the Temple of the Lord because the glorious presence of the Lord filled it .
14:7:003:0	When all the people of Israel saw the fire coming down and the glorious presence of the Lord filling the Temple , they fell face down on the ground and worshiped and praised the Lord , saying , “ He is good ! His faithful love endures forever ! ”
14:7:004:0	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord .
14:7:005:0	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats . And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God .
14:7:006:0	The priests took their assigned positions , and so did the Levites who were singing , “ His faithful love endures forever ! ” They accompanied the singing with music from the instruments King David had made for praising the Lord . Across from the Levites , the priests blew the trumpets , while all Israel stood .
14:7:007:0	Solomon then consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the Lord 's Temple . He offered burnt offerings and the fat of peace offerings there , because the bronze altar he had built could not hold all the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and sacrificial fat .
14:7:008:0	For the next seven days Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters . A large congregation had gathered from as far away as Lebo-hamath in the north and the Brook of Egypt in the south .
14:7:009:0	On the eighth day they had a closing ceremony , for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the Festival of Shelters for seven days .
14:7:002:1	The
14:7:003:1	Lord
14:7:004:1	's Response to Solomon
14:7:010:0	Then at the end of the celebration , Solomon sent the people home . They were all joyful and glad because the Lord had been so good to David and to Solomon and to his people Israel .
14:7:011:0	So Solomon finished the Temple of the Lord , as well as the royal palace . He completed everything he had planned to do in the construction of the Temple and the palace .
14:7:012:0	Then one night the Lord appeared to Solomon and said , “ I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices .
14:7:013:0	At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls , or command grasshoppers to devour your crops , or send plagues among you .
14:7:014:0	Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land .
14:7:015:0	My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to every prayer made in this place .
14:7:016:0	For I have chosen this Temple and set it apart to be holy — a place where my name will be honored forever . I will always watch over it , for it is dear to my heart .
14:7:017:0	“ As for you , if you faithfully follow me as David your father did , obeying all my commands , decrees , and regulations ,
14:7:018:0	then I will establish the throne of your dynasty . For I made this covenant with your father , David , when I said , ‘ One of your descendants will always rule over Israel . '
14:7:019:0	“ But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the decrees and commands I have given you , and if you serve and worship other gods ,
14:7:020:0	then I will uproot the people from this land that I have given them . I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name . I will make it an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations .
14:7:021:0	And though this Temple is impressive now , all who pass by will be appalled . They will ask , ‘ Why did the Lord do such terrible things to this land and to this Temple ? '
14:7:022:0	“ And the answer will be , ‘ Because his people abandoned the Lord , the God of their ancestors , who brought them out of Egypt , and they worshiped other gods instead and bowed down to them . That is why he has brought all these disasters on them . ' ”
