14:15:001:1	Asa 's Religious Reforms
14:15:001:0	Then the Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded ,
14:15:002:0	and he went out to meet King Asa as he was returning from the battle . “ Listen to me , Asa ! ” he shouted . “ Listen , all you people of Judah and Benjamin ! The Lord will stay with you as long as you stay with him ! Whenever you seek him , you will find him . But if you abandon him , he will abandon you .
14:15:003:0	For a long time Israel was without the true God , without a priest to teach them , and without the Law to instruct them .
14:15:004:0	But whenever they were in trouble and turned to the Lord , the God of Israel , and sought him out , they found him .
14:15:005:0	“ During those dark times , it was not safe to travel . Problems troubled the people of every land .
14:15:006:0	Nation fought against nation , and city against city , for God was troubling them with every kind of problem .
14:15:007:0	But as for you , be strong and courageous , for your work will be rewarded . ”
14:15:008:0	When Asa heard this message from Azariah the prophet , he took courage and removed all the detestable idols from the land of Judah and Benjamin and in the towns he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim . And he repaired the altar of the Lord , which stood in front of the entry room of the Lord 's Temple .
14:15:009:0	Then Asa called together all the people of Judah and Benjamin , along with the people of Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon who had settled among them . For many from Israel had moved to Judah during Asa 's reign when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
14:15:010:0	The people gathered at Jerusalem in late spring , during the fifteenth year of Asa 's reign .
14:15:011:0	On that day they sacrificed to the Lord 700 cattle and 7,000 sheep and goats from the plunder they had taken in the battle .
14:15:012:0	Then they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord , the God of their ancestors , with all their heart and soul .
14:15:013:0	They agreed that anyone who refused to seek the Lord , the God of Israel , would be put to death — whether young or old , man or woman .
14:15:014:0	They shouted out their oath of loyalty to the Lord with trumpets blaring and rams ' horns sounding .
14:15:015:0	All in Judah were happy about this covenant , for they had entered into it with all their heart . They earnestly sought after God , and they found him . And the Lord gave them rest from their enemies on every side .
14:15:016:0	King Asa even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene Asherah pole . He cut down her obscene pole , broke it up , and burned it in the Kidron Valley .
14:15:017:0	Although the pagan shrines were not removed from Israel , Asa 's heart remained completely faithful throughout his life .
14:15:018:0	He brought into the Temple of God the silver and gold and the various items that he and his father had dedicated .
14:15:019:0	So there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa 's reign .
