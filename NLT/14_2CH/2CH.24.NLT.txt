14:24:001:1	Joash Repairs the Temple
14:24:001:0	Joash was seven years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years . His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba .
14:24:002:0	Joash did what was pleasing in the Lord 's sight throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest .
14:24:003:0	Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash , and he had sons and daughters .
14:24:004:0	At one point Joash decided to repair and restore the Temple of the Lord .
14:24:005:0	He summoned the priests and Levites and gave them these instructions : “ Go to all the towns of Judah and collect the required annual offerings , so that we can repair the Temple of your God . Do not delay ! ” But the Levites did not act immediately .
14:24:006:0	So the king called for Jehoiada the high priest and asked him , “ Why have n't you demanded that the Levites go out and collect the Temple taxes from the towns of Judah and from Jerusalem ? Moses , the servant of the Lord , levied this tax on the community of Israel in order to maintain the Tabernacle of the Covenant . ”
14:24:007:0	Over the years the followers of wicked Athaliah had broken into the Temple of God , and they had used all the dedicated things from the Temple of the Lord to worship the images of Baal .
14:24:008:0	So now the king ordered a chest to be made and set outside the gate leading to the Temple of the Lord .
14:24:009:0	Then a proclamation was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem , telling the people to bring to the Lord the tax that Moses , the servant of God , had required of the Israelites in the wilderness .
14:24:010:0	This pleased all the leaders and the people , and they gladly brought their money and filled the chest with it .
14:24:011:0	Whenever the chest became full , the Levites would carry it to the king 's officials . Then the court secretary and an officer of the high priest would come and empty the chest and take it back to the Temple again . This went on day after day , and a large amount of money was collected .
14:24:012:0	The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the construction supervisors , who hired masons and carpenters to restore the Temple of the Lord . They also hired metalworkers , who made articles of iron and bronze for the Lord 's Temple .
14:24:013:0	The men in charge of the renovation worked hard and made steady progress . They restored the Temple of God according to its original design and strengthened it .
14:24:014:0	When all the repairs were finished , they brought the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada . It was used to make various articles for the Temple of the Lord—articles for worship services and for burnt offerings , including ladles and other articles made of gold and silver . And the burnt offerings were sacrificed continually in the Temple of the Lord during the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest .
14:24:015:0	Jehoiada lived to a very old age , finally dying at 130 .
14:24:002:1	Jehoiada 's Reforms Reversed
14:24:016:0	He was buried among the kings in the City of David , because he had done so much good in Israel for God and his Temple .
14:24:017:0	But after Jehoiada 's death , the leaders of Judah came and bowed before King Joash and persuaded him to listen to their advice .
14:24:018:0	They decided to abandon the Temple of the Lord , the God of their ancestors , and they worshiped Asherah poles and idols instead ! Because of this sin , divine anger fell on Judah and Jerusalem .
14:24:019:0	Yet the Lord sent prophets to bring them back to him . The prophets warned them , but still the people would not listen .
14:24:020:0	Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest . He stood before the people and said , “ This is what God says : Why do you disobey the Lord 's commands and keep yourselves from prospering ? You have abandoned the Lord , and now he has abandoned you ! ”
14:24:021:0	Then the leaders plotted to kill Zechariah , and King Joash ordered that they stone him to death in the courtyard of the Lord 's Temple .
14:24:003:1	The End of Joash 's Reign
14:24:022:0	That was how King Joash repaid Jehoiada for his loyalty—by killing his son . Zechariah 's last words as he died were , “ May the Lord see what they are doing and avenge my death ! ”
14:24:023:0	In the spring of the year the Aramean army marched against Joash . They invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the nation . Then they sent all the plunder back to their king in Damascus .
14:24:024:0	Although the Arameans attacked with only a small army , the Lord helped them conquer the much larger army of Judah . The people of Judah had abandoned the Lord , the God of their ancestors , so judgment was carried out against Joash .
14:24:025:0	The Arameans withdrew , leaving Joash severely wounded . But his own officials plotted to kill him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest . They assassinated him as he lay in bed . Then he was buried in the City of David , but not in the royal cemetery .
14:24:026:0	The assassins were Jozacar , the son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath , and Jehozabad , the son of a Moabite woman named Shomer .
14:24:027:0	The account of the sons of Joash , the prophecies about him , and the record of his restoration of the Temple of God are written in The Commentary on the Book of the Kings . His son Amaziah became the next king .
