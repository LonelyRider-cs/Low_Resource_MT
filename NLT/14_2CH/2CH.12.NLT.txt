14:12:001:1	Egypt Invades Judah
14:12:001:0	But when Rehoboam was firmly established and strong , he abandoned the Law of the Lord , and all Israel followed him in this sin .
14:12:002:0	Because they were unfaithful to the Lord , King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam 's reign .
14:12:003:0	He came with 1,200 chariots , 60,000 horses , and a countless army of foot soldiers , including Libyans , Sukkites , and Ethiopians .
14:12:004:0	Shishak conquered Judah 's fortified towns and then advanced to attack Jerusalem .
14:12:005:0	The prophet Shemaiah then met with Rehoboam and Judah 's leaders , who had all fled to Jerusalem because of Shishak . Shemaiah told them , “ This is what the Lord says : You have abandoned me , so I am abandoning you to Shishak . ”
14:12:006:0	Then the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said , “ The Lord is right in doing this to us ! ”
14:12:007:0	When the Lord saw their change of heart , he gave this message to Shemaiah : “ Since the people have humbled themselves , I will not completely destroy them and will soon give them some relief . I will not use Shishak to pour out my anger on Jerusalem .
14:12:008:0	But they will become his subjects , so they will know the difference between serving me and serving earthly rulers . ”
14:12:009:0	So King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem . He ransacked the treasuries of the Lord 's Temple and the royal palace ; he stole everything , including all the gold shields Solomon had made .
14:12:010:0	King Rehoboam later replaced them with bronze shields as substitutes , and he entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace .
14:12:011:0	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the Lord , the guards would also take the shields and then return them to the guardroom .
14:12:002:1	Summary of Rehoboam 's Reign
14:12:012:0	Because Rehoboam humbled himself , the Lord 's anger was turned away , and he did not destroy him completely . There were still some good things in the land of Judah .
14:12:013:0	King Rehoboam firmly established himself in Jerusalem and continued to rule . He was forty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city the Lord had chosen from among all the tribes of Israel as the place to honor his name . Rehoboam 's mother was Naamah , a woman from Ammon .
14:12:014:0	But he was an evil king , for he did not seek the Lord with all his heart .
14:12:015:0	The rest of the events of Rehoboam 's reign , from beginning to end , are recorded in The Record of Shemaiah the Prophet and The Record of Iddo the Seer , which are part of the genealogical record . Rehoboam and Jeroboam were continually at war with each other .
14:12:016:0	When Rehoboam died , he was buried in the City of David . Then his son Abijah became the next king .
