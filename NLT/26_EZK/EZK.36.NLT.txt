26:36:001:1	Restoration for Israel
26:36:001:0	“ Son of man , prophesy to Israel 's mountains . Give them this message : O mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord !
26:36:002:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Your enemies have taunted you , saying , ‘ Aha ! Now the ancient heights belong to us ! '
26:36:003:0	Therefore , son of man , give the mountains of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord : Your enemies have attacked you from all directions , making you the property of many nations and the object of much mocking and slander .
26:36:004:0	Therefore , O mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Sovereign Lord . He speaks to the hills and mountains , ravines and valleys , and to ruined wastes and long-deserted cities that have been destroyed and mocked by the surrounding nations .
26:36:005:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : My jealous anger burns against these nations , especially Edom , because they have shown utter contempt for me by gleefully taking my land for themselves as plunder .
26:36:006:0	“ Therefore , prophesy to the hills and mountains , the ravines and valleys of Israel . This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I am furious that you have suffered shame before the surrounding nations .
26:36:007:0	Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I have taken a solemn oath that those nations will soon have their own shame to endure .
26:36:008:0	“ But the mountains of Israel will produce heavy crops of fruit for my people—for they will be coming home again soon !
26:36:009:0	See , I care about you , and I will pay attention to you . Your ground will be plowed and your crops planted .
26:36:010:0	I will greatly increase the population of Israel , and the ruined cities will be rebuilt and filled with people .
26:36:011:0	I will increase not only the people , but also your animals . O mountains of Israel , I will bring people to live on you once again . I will make you even more prosperous than you were before . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:36:012:0	I will cause my people to walk on you once again , and you will be their territory . You will never again rob them of their children .
26:36:013:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : The other nations taunt you , saying , ‘ Israel is a land that devours its own people and robs them of their children ! '
26:36:014:0	But you will never again devour your people or rob them of their children , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:36:015:0	I will not let you hear those other nations insult you , and you will no longer be mocked by them . You will not be a land that causes its nation to fall , says the Sovereign Lord . ”
26:36:016:0	Then this further message came to me from the Lord :
26:36:017:0	“ Son of man , when the people of Israel were living in their own land , they defiled it by the evil way they lived . To me their conduct was as unclean as a woman 's menstrual cloth .
26:36:018:0	They polluted the land with murder and the worship of idols , so I poured out my fury on them .
26:36:019:0	I scattered them to many lands to punish them for the evil way they had lived .
26:36:020:0	But when they were scattered among the nations , they brought shame on my holy name . For the nations said , ‘ These are the people of the Lord , but he could n't keep them safe in his own land ! '
26:36:021:0	Then I was concerned for my holy name , on which my people brought shame among the nations .
26:36:022:0	“ Therefore , give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord : I am bringing you back , but not because you deserve it . I am doing it to protect my holy name , on which you brought shame while you were scattered among the nations .
26:36:023:0	I will show how holy my great name is—the name on which you brought shame among the nations . And when I reveal my holiness through you before their very eyes , says the Sovereign Lord , then the nations will know that I am the Lord .
26:36:024:0	For I will gather you up from all the nations and bring you home again to your land .
26:36:025:0	“ Then I will sprinkle clean water on you , and you will be clean . Your filth will be washed away , and you will no longer worship idols .
26:36:026:0	And I will give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit in you . I will take out your stony , stubborn heart and give you a tender , responsive heart .
26:36:027:0	And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations .
26:36:028:0	“ And you will live in Israel , the land I gave your ancestors long ago . You will be my people , and I will be your God .
26:36:029:0	I will cleanse you of your filthy behavior . I will give you good crops of grain , and I will send no more famines on the land .
26:36:030:0	I will give you great harvests from your fruit trees and fields , and never again will the surrounding nations be able to scoff at your land for its famines .
26:36:031:0	Then you will remember your past sins and despise yourselves for all the detestable things you did .
26:36:032:0	But remember , says the Sovereign Lord , I am not doing this because you deserve it . O my people of Israel , you should be utterly ashamed of all you have done !
26:36:033:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : When I cleanse you from your sins , I will repopulate your cities , and the ruins will be rebuilt .
26:36:034:0	The fields that used to lie empty and desolate in plain view of everyone will again be farmed .
26:36:035:0	And when I bring you back , people will say , ‘ This former wasteland is now like the Garden of Eden ! The abandoned and ruined cities now have strong walls and are filled with people ! '
26:36:036:0	Then the surrounding nations that survive will know that I , the Lord , have rebuilt the ruins and replanted the wasteland . For I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will do what I say .
26:36:037:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I am ready to hear Israel 's prayers and to increase their numbers like a flock .
26:36:038:0	They will be as numerous as the sacred flocks that fill Jerusalem 's streets at the time of her festivals . The ruined cities will be crowded with people once more , and everyone will know that I am the Lord . ”
