26:31:001:1	Egypt Compared to Fallen Assyria
26:31:001:0	On June 21 , during the eleventh year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:31:002:0	“ Son of man , give this message to Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and all his hordes : “ To whom would you compare your greatness ?
26:31:003:0	You are like mighty Assyria , which was once like a cedar of Lebanon , with beautiful branches that cast deep forest shadeand with its top high among the clouds .
26:31:004:0	Deep springs watered itand helped it to grow tall and luxuriant.The water flowed around it like a river , streaming to all the trees nearby .
26:31:005:0	This great tree towered high , higher than all the other trees around it.It prospered and grew long thick branchesbecause of all the water at its roots .
26:31:006:0	The birds nested in its branches , and in its shade all the wild animals gave birth.All the great nations of the worldlived in its shadow .
26:31:007:0	It was strong and beautiful , with wide-spreading branches , for its roots went deepinto abundant water .
26:31:008:0	No other cedar in the garden of Godcould rival it.No cypress had branches to equal it ; no plane tree had boughs to compare.No tree in the garden of Godcame close to it in beauty .
26:31:009:0	Because I made this tree so beautiful , and gave it such magnificent foliage , it was the envy of all the other trees of Eden , the garden of God .
26:31:010:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because Egypt became proud and arrogant , and because it set itself so high above the others , with its top reaching to the clouds ,
26:31:011:0	I will hand it over to a mighty nation that will destroy it as its wickedness deserves . I have already discarded it .
26:31:012:0	A foreign army—the terror of the nations—has cut it down and left it fallen on the ground . Its branches are scattered across the mountains and valleys and ravines of the land . All those who lived in its shadow have gone away and left it lying there .
26:31:013:0	“ The birds roost on its fallen trunk , and the wild animals lie among its branches .
26:31:014:0	Let the tree of no other nationproudly exult in its own prosperity , though it be higher than the cloudsand it be watered from the depths.For all are doomed to die , to go down to the depths of the earth.They will land in the pitalong with everyone else on earth .
26:31:015:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : When Assyria went down to the grave , I made the deep springs mourn . I stopped its rivers and dried up its abundant water . I clothed Lebanon in black and caused the trees of the field to wilt .
26:31:016:0	I made the nations shake with fear at the sound of its fall , for I sent it down to the grave with all the others who descend to the pit . And all the other proud trees of Eden , the most beautiful and the best of Lebanon , the ones whose roots went deep into the water , took comfort to find it there with them in the depths of the earth .
26:31:017:0	Its allies , too , were all destroyed and had passed away . They had gone down to the grave—all those nations that had lived in its shade .
26:31:018:0	“ O Egypt , to which of the trees of Eden will you compare your strength and glory ? You , too , will be brought down to the depths with all these other nations . You will lie there among the outcasts who have died by the sword . This will be the fate of Pharaoh and all his hordes . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
