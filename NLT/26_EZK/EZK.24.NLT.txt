26:24:001:1	The Sign of the Cooking Pot
26:24:001:0	On January 15 , during the ninth year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:24:002:0	“ Son of man , write down today 's date , because on this very day the king of Babylon is beginning his attack against Jerusalem .
26:24:003:0	Then give these rebels an illustration with this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ Put a pot on the fire , and pour in some water .
26:24:004:0	Fill it with choice pieces of meat — the rump and the shoulderand all the most tender cuts .
26:24:005:0	Use only the best sheep from the flock , and heap fuel on the fire beneath the pot.Bring the pot to a boil , and cook the bones along with the meat .
26:24:006:0	“ Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says : What sorrow awaits Jerusalem , the city of murderers ! She is a cooking potwhose corruption ca n't be cleaned out.Take the meat out in random order , for no piece is better than another .
26:24:007:0	For the blood of her murdersis splashed on the rocks.It is n't even spilled on the ground , where the dust could cover it !
26:24:008:0	So I will splash her blood on a rockfor all to see , an expression of my angerand vengeance against her .
26:24:009:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : What sorrow awaits Jerusalem , the city of murderers ! I myself will pile up the fuel beneath her .
26:24:010:0	Yes , heap on the wood ! Let the fire roar to make the pot boil.Cook the meat with many spices , and afterward burn the bones .
26:24:011:0	Now set the empty pot on the coals.Heat it red hot ! Burn away the filth and corruption .
26:24:012:0	But it 's hopeless ; the corruption ca n't be cleaned out.So throw it into the fire .
26:24:013:0	Your impurity is your lewdnessand the corruption of your idolatry.I tried to cleanse you , but you refused.So now you will remain in your filthuntil my fury against you has been satisfied .
26:24:002:1	The Death of Ezekiel 's Wife
26:24:014:0	“ I , the Lord , have spoken ! The time has come , and I wo n't hold back . I will not change my mind , and I will have no pity on you . You will be judged on the basis of all your wicked actions , says the Sovereign Lord . ”
26:24:015:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:24:016:0	“ Son of man , with one blow I will take away your dearest treasure . Yet you must not show any sorrow at her death . Do not weep ; let there be no tears .
26:24:017:0	Groan silently , but let there be no wailing at her grave . Do not uncover your head or take off your sandals . Do not perform the usual rituals of mourning or accept any food brought to you by consoling friends . ”
26:24:018:0	So I proclaimed this to the people the next morning , and in the evening my wife died . The next morning I did everything I had been told to do .
26:24:019:0	Then the people asked , “ What does all this mean ? What are you trying to tell us ? ”
26:24:020:0	So I said to them , “ A message came to me from the Lord ,
26:24:021:0	and I was told to give this message to the people of Israel . This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will defile my Temple , the source of your security and pride , the place your heart delights in . Your sons and daughters whom you left behind in Judah will be slaughtered by the sword .
26:24:022:0	Then you will do as Ezekiel has done . You will not mourn in public or console yourselves by eating the food brought by friends .
26:24:023:0	Your heads will remain covered , and your sandals will not be taken off . You will not mourn or weep , but you will waste away because of your sins . You will groan among yourselves for all the evil you have done .
26:24:024:0	Ezekiel is an example for you ; you will do just as he has done . And when that time comes , you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord . ”
26:24:025:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , on the day I take away their stronghold — their joy and glory , their heart 's desire , their dearest treasure — I will also take away their sons and daughters .
26:24:026:0	And on that day a survivor from Jerusalem will come to you in Babylon and tell you what has happened .
26:24:027:0	And when he arrives , your voice will suddenly return so you can talk to him , and you will be a symbol for these people . Then they will know that I am the Lord . ”
