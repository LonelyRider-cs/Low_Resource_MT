26:11:001:1	Judgment on Israel 's Leaders
26:11:001:0	Then the Spirit lifted me and brought me to the east gateway of the Lord 's Temple , where I saw twenty-five prominent men of the city . Among them were Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah , who were leaders among the people .
26:11:002:0	The Spirit said to me , “ Son of man , these are the men who are planning evil and giving wicked counsel in this city .
26:11:003:0	They say to the people , ‘ Is it not a good time to build houses ? This city is like an iron pot . We are safe inside it like meat in a pot . '
26:11:004:0	Therefore , son of man , prophesy against them loudly and clearly . ”
26:11:005:0	Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me , and he told me to say , “ This is what the Lord says to the people of Israel : I know what you are saying , for I know every thought that comes into your minds .
26:11:006:0	You have murdered many in this city and filled its streets with the dead .
26:11:007:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : This city is an iron pot all right , but the pieces of meat are the victims of your injustice . As for you , I will soon drag you from this pot .
26:11:008:0	I will bring on you the sword of war you so greatly fear , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:11:009:0	I will drive you out of Jerusalem and hand you over to foreigners , who will carry out my judgments against you .
26:11:010:0	You will be slaughtered all the way to the borders of Israel . I will execute judgment on you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
26:11:011:0	No , this city will not be an iron pot for you , and you will not be like meat safe inside it . I will judge you even to the borders of Israel ,
26:11:012:0	and you will know that I am the Lord . For you have refused to obey my decrees and regulations ; instead , you have copied the standards of the nations around you . ”
26:11:002:1	Hope for Exiled Israel
26:11:013:0	While I was still prophesying , Pelatiah son of Benaiah suddenly died . Then I fell face down on the ground and cried out , “ O Sovereign Lord , are you going to kill everyone in Israel ? ”
26:11:014:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:11:015:0	“ Son of man , the people still left in Jerusalem are talking about you and your relatives and all the people of Israel who are in exile . They are saying , ‘ Those people are far away from the Lord , so now he has given their land to us ! '
26:11:016:0	“ Therefore , tell the exiles , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Although I have scattered you in the countries of the world , I will be a sanctuary to you during your time in exile .
26:11:017:0	I , the Sovereign Lord , will gather you back from the nations where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel once again . '
26:11:018:0	“ When the people return to their homeland , they will remove every trace of their vile images and detestable idols .
26:11:019:0	And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them . I will take away their stony , stubborn heart and give them a tender , responsive heart ,
26:11:020:0	so they will obey my decrees and regulations . Then they will truly be my people , and I will be their God .
26:11:003:1	The
26:11:004:1	Lord
26:11:005:1	's Glory Leaves Jerusalem
26:11:021:0	But as for those who long for vile images and detestable idols , I will repay them fully for their sins . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
26:11:022:0	Then the cherubim lifted their wings and rose into the air with their wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them .
26:11:023:0	Then the glory of the Lord went up from the city and stopped above the mountain to the east .
26:11:024:0	Afterward the Spirit of God carried me back again to Babylonia , to the people in exile there . And so ended the vision of my visit to Jerusalem .
26:11:025:0	And I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me .
