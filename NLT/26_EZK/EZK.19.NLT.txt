26:19:001:1	A Funeral Song for Israel 's Kings
26:19:001:0	“ Sing this funeral song for the princes of Israel :
26:19:002:0	“ What is your mother ? A lioness among lions ! She lay down among the young lionsand reared her cubs .
26:19:003:0	She raised one of her cubsto become a strong young lion.He learned to hunt and devour prey , and he became a man-eater .
26:19:004:0	Then the nations heard about him , and he was trapped in their pit.They led him away with hooksto the land of Egypt .
26:19:005:0	“ When the lioness sawthat her hopes for him were gone , she took another of her cubsand taught him to be a strong young lion .
26:19:006:0	He prowled among the other lionsand stood out among them in his strength.He learned to hunt and devour prey , and he , too , became a man-eater .
26:19:007:0	He demolished fortressesand destroyed their towns and cities.Their farms were desolated , and their crops were destroyed.The land and its people trembled in fearwhen they heard him roar .
26:19:008:0	Then the armies of the nations attacked him , surrounding him from every direction.They threw a net over himand captured him in their pit .
26:19:009:0	With hooks , they dragged him into a cageand brought him before the king of Babylon.They held him in captivity , so his voice could never again be heardon the mountains of Israel .
26:19:010:0	“ Your mother was like a vineplanted by the water 's edge.It had lush , green foliagebecause of the abundant water .
26:19:011:0	Its branches became strong—strong enough to be a ruler 's scepter.It grew very tall , towering above all others.It stood out because of its heightand its many lush branches .
26:19:012:0	But the vine was uprooted in furyand thrown down to the ground.The desert wind dried up its fruitand tore off its strong branches , so that it witheredand was destroyed by fire .
26:19:013:0	Now the vine is transplanted to the wilderness , where the ground is hard and dry .
26:19:014:0	A fire has burst out from its branchesand devoured its fruit.Its remaining limbs are notstrong enough to be a ruler 's scepter. “ This is a funeral song , and it will be used in a funeral . ”
