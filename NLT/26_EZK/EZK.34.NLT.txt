26:34:001:1	The Shepherds of Israel
26:34:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:34:002:0	“ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds , the leaders of Israel . Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : What sorrow awaits you shepherds who feed yourselves instead of your flocks . Should n't shepherds feed their sheep ?
26:34:003:0	You drink the milk , wear the wool , and butcher the best animals , but you let your flocks starve .
26:34:004:0	You have not taken care of the weak . You have not tended the sick or bound up the injured . You have not gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost . Instead , you have ruled them with harshness and cruelty .
26:34:005:0	So my sheep have been scattered without a shepherd , and they are easy prey for any wild animal .
26:34:006:0	They have wandered through all the mountains and all the hills , across the face of the earth , yet no one has gone to search for them .
26:34:007:0	“ Therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
26:34:008:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , you abandoned my flock and left them to be attacked by every wild animal . And though you were my shepherds , you did n't search for my sheep when they were lost . You took care of yourselves and left the sheep to starve .
26:34:009:0	Therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord .
26:34:002:1	The Good Shepherd
26:34:010:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I now consider these shepherds my enemies , and I will hold them responsible for what has happened to my flock . I will take away their right to feed the flock , and I will stop them from feeding themselves . I will rescue my flock from their mouths ; the sheep will no longer be their prey .
26:34:011:0	“ For this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I myself will search and find my sheep .
26:34:012:0	I will be like a shepherd looking for his scattered flock . I will find my sheep and rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on that dark and cloudy day .
26:34:013:0	I will bring them back home to their own land of Israel from among the peoples and nations . I will feed them on the mountains of Israel and by the rivers and in all the places where people live .
26:34:014:0	Yes , I will give them good pastureland on the high hills of Israel . There they will lie down in pleasant places and feed in the lush pastures of the hills .
26:34:015:0	I myself will tend my sheep and give them a place to lie down in peace , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:34:016:0	I will search for my lost ones who strayed away , and I will bring them safely home again . I will bandage the injured and strengthen the weak . But I will destroy those who are fat and powerful . I will feed them , yes — feed them justice !
26:34:017:0	“ And as for you , my flock , this is what the Sovereign Lord says to his people : I will judge between one animal of the flock and another , separating the sheep from the goats .
26:34:018:0	Is n't it enough for you to keep the best of the pastures for yourselves ? Must you also trample down the rest ? Is n't it enough for you to drink clear water for yourselves ? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet ?
26:34:019:0	Why must my flock eat what you have trampled down and drink water you have fouled ?
26:34:020:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will surely judge between the fat sheep and the scrawny sheep .
26:34:021:0	For you fat sheep pushed and butted and crowded my sick and hungry flock until you scattered them to distant lands .
26:34:022:0	So I will rescue my flock , and they will no longer be abused . I will judge between one animal of the flock and another .
26:34:023:0	And I will set over them one shepherd , my servant David . He will feed them and be a shepherd to them .
26:34:003:1	The
26:34:004:1	Lord
26:34:005:1	's Covenant of Peace
26:34:024:0	And I , the Lord , will be their God , and my servant David will be a prince among my people . I , the Lord , have spoken !
26:34:025:0	“ I will make a covenant of peace with my people and drive away the dangerous animals from the land . Then they will be able to camp safely in the wildest places and sleep in the woods without fear .
26:34:026:0	I will bless my people and their homes around my holy hill . And in the proper season I will send the showers they need . There will be showers of blessing .
26:34:027:0	The orchards and fields of my people will yield bumper crops , and everyone will live in safety . When I have broken their chains of slavery and rescued them from those who enslaved them , then they will know that I am the Lord .
26:34:028:0	They will no longer be prey for other nations , and wild animals will no longer devour them . They will live in safety , and no one will frighten them .
26:34:029:0	“ And I will make their land famous for its crops , so my people will never again suffer from famines or the insults of foreign nations .
26:34:030:0	In this way , they will know that I , the Lord their God , am with them . And they will know that they , the people of Israel , are my people , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:34:031:0	You are my flock , the sheep of my pasture . You are my people , and I am your God . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
