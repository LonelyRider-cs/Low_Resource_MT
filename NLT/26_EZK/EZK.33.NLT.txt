26:33:001:1	Ezekiel as Israel 's Watchman
26:33:001:0	Once again a message came to me from the Lord :
26:33:002:0	“ Son of man , give your people this message : ‘ When I bring an army against a country , the people of that land choose one of their own to be a watchman .
26:33:003:0	When the watchman sees the enemy coming , he sounds the alarm to warn the people .
26:33:004:0	Then if those who hear the alarm refuse to take action , it is their own fault if they die .
26:33:005:0	They heard the alarm but ignored it , so the responsibility is theirs . If they had listened to the warning , they could have saved their lives .
26:33:006:0	But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and does n't sound the alarm to warn the people , he is responsible for their captivity . They will die in their sins , but I will hold the watchman responsible for their deaths . '
26:33:007:0	“ Now , son of man , I am making you a watchman for the people of Israel . Therefore , listen to what I say and warn them for me .
26:33:008:0	If I announce that some wicked people are sure to die and you fail to tell them to change their ways , then they will die in their sins , and I will hold you responsible for their deaths .
26:33:002:1	The Watchman 's Message
26:33:009:0	But if you warn them to repent and they do n't repent , they will die in their sins , but you will have saved yourself .
26:33:010:0	“ Son of man , give the people of Israel this message : You are saying , ‘ Our sins are heavy upon us ; we are wasting away ! How can we survive ? '
26:33:011:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , I take no pleasure in the death of wicked people . I only want them to turn from their wicked ways so they can live . Turn ! Turn from your wickedness , O people of Israel ! Why should you die ?
26:33:012:0	“ Son of man , give your people this message : The righteous behavior of righteous people will not save them if they turn to sin , nor will the wicked behavior of wicked people destroy them if they repent and turn from their sins .
26:33:013:0	When I tell righteous people that they will live , but then they sin , expecting their past righteousness to save them , then none of their righteous acts will be remembered . I will destroy them for their sins .
26:33:014:0	And suppose I tell some wicked people that they will surely die , but then they turn from their sins and do what is just and right .
26:33:015:0	For instance , they might give back a debtor 's security , return what they have stolen , and obey my life-giving laws , no longer doing what is evil . If they do this , then they will surely live and not die .
26:33:016:0	None of their past sins will be brought up again , for they have done what is just and right , and they will surely live .
26:33:017:0	“ Your people are saying , ‘ The Lord is n't doing what 's right , ' but it is they who are not doing what 's right .
26:33:018:0	For again I say , when righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and turn to evil , they will die .
26:33:019:0	But if wicked people turn from their wickedness and do what is just and right , they will live .
26:33:003:1	Explanation of Jerusalem 's Fall
26:33:020:0	O people of Israel , you are saying , ‘ The Lord is n't doing what 's right . ' But I judge each of you according to your deeds . ”
26:33:021:0	On January 8 , during the twelfth year of our captivity , a survivor from Jerusalem came to me and said , “ The city has fallen ! ”
26:33:022:0	The previous evening the Lord had taken hold of me and given me back my voice . So I was able to speak when this man arrived the next morning .
26:33:023:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:33:024:0	“ Son of man , the scattered remnants of Israel living among the ruined cities keep saying , ‘ Abraham was only one man , yet he gained possession of the entire land . We are many ; surely the land has been given to us as a possession . '
26:33:025:0	So tell these people , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : You eat meat with blood in it , you worship idols , and you murder the innocent . Do you really think the land should be yours ?
26:33:026:0	Murderers ! Idolaters ! Adulterers ! Should the land belong to you ? '
26:33:027:0	“ Say to them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : As surely as I live , those living in the ruins will die by the sword . And I will send wild animals to eat those living in the open fields . Those hiding in the forts and caves will die of disease .
26:33:028:0	I will completely destroy the land and demolish her pride . Her arrogant power will come to an end . The mountains of Israel will be so desolate that no one will even travel through them .
26:33:029:0	When I have completely destroyed the land because of their detestable sins , then they will know that I am the Lord . '
26:33:030:0	“ Son of man , your people talk about you in their houses and whisper about you at the doors . They say to each other , ‘ Come on , let 's go hear the prophet tell us what the Lord is saying ! '
26:33:031:0	So my people come pretending to be sincere and sit before you . They listen to your words , but they have no intention of doing what you say . Their mouths are full of lustful words , and their hearts seek only after money .
26:33:032:0	You are very entertaining to them , like someone who sings love songs with a beautiful voice or plays fine music on an instrument . They hear what you say , but they do n't act on it !
26:33:033:0	But when all these terrible things happen to them—as they certainly will—then they will know a prophet has been among them . ”
