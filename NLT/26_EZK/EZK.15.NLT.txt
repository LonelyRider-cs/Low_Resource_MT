26:15:001:1	Jerusalem—a Useless Vine
26:15:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:15:002:0	“ Son of man , how does a grapevine compare to a tree ? Is a vine 's wood as useful as the wood of a tree ?
26:15:003:0	Can its wood be used for making things , like pegs to hang up pots and pans ?
26:15:004:0	No , it can only be used for fuel , and even as fuel , it burns too quickly .
26:15:005:0	Vines are useless both before and after being put into the fire !
26:15:006:0	“ And this is what the Sovereign Lord says : The people of Jerusalem are like grapevines growing among the trees of the forest . Since they are useless , I have thrown them on the fire to be burned .
26:15:007:0	And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire , they will fall into another . When I turn against them , you will know that I am the Lord .
26:15:008:0	And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
