26:10:001:1	The
26:10:002:1	Lord
26:10:003:1	's Glory Leaves the Temple
26:10:001:0	In my vision I saw what appeared to be a throne of blue lapis lazuli above the crystal surface over the heads of the cherubim .
26:10:002:0	Then the Lord spoke to the man in linen clothing and said , “ Go between the whirling wheels beneath the cherubim , and take a handful of burning coals and scatter them over the city. ” He did this as I watched .
26:10:003:0	The cherubim were standing at the south end of the Temple when the man went in , and the cloud of glory filled the inner courtyard .
26:10:004:0	Then the glory of the Lord rose up from above the cherubim and went over to the entrance of the Temple . The Temple was filled with this cloud of glory , and the courtyard glowed brightly with the glory of the Lord .
26:10:005:0	The moving wings of the cherubim sounded like the voice of God Almighty and could be heard even in the outer courtyard .
26:10:006:0	The Lord said to the man in linen clothing , “ Go between the cherubim and take some burning coals from between the wheels. ” So the man went in and stood beside one of the wheels .
26:10:007:0	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand and took some live coals from the fire burning among them . He put the coals into the hands of the man in linen clothing , and the man took them and went out .
26:10:008:0	( All the cherubim had what looked like human hands under their wings . )
26:10:009:0	I looked , and each of the four cherubim had a wheel beside him , and the wheels sparkled like beryl .
26:10:010:0	All four wheels looked alike and were made the same ; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it .
26:10:011:0	The cherubim could move in any of the four directions they faced , without turning as they moved . They went straight in the direction they faced , never turning aside .
26:10:012:0	Both the cherubim and the wheels were covered with eyes . The cherubim had eyes all over their bodies , including their hands , their backs , and their wings .
26:10:013:0	I heard someone refer to the wheels as “ the whirling wheels . ”
26:10:014:0	Each of the four cherubim had four faces : the first was the face of an ox , the second was a human face , the third was the face of a lion , and the fourth was the face of an eagle .
26:10:015:0	Then the cherubim rose upward . These were the same living beings I had seen beside the Kebar River .
26:10:016:0	When the cherubim moved , the wheels moved with them . When they lifted their wings to fly , the wheels stayed beside them .
26:10:017:0	When the cherubim stopped , the wheels stopped . When they flew upward , the wheels rose up , for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels .
26:10:018:0	Then the glory of the Lord moved out from the entrance of the Temple and hovered above the cherubim .
26:10:019:0	And as I watched , the cherubim flew with their wheels to the east gate of the Lord 's Temple . And the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them .
26:10:020:0	These were the same living beings I had seen beneath the God of Israel when I was by the Kebar River . I knew they were cherubim ,
26:10:021:0	for each had four faces and four wings and what looked like human hands under their wings .
26:10:022:0	And their faces were just like the faces of the beings I had seen at the Kebar , and they traveled straight ahead , just as the others had .
