26:25:001:1	A Message for Ammon
26:25:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:25:002:0	“ Son of man , turn and face the land of Ammon and prophesy against its people .
26:25:003:0	Give the Ammonites this message from the Sovereign Lord : Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord ! Because you cheered when my Temple was defiled , mocked Israel in her desolation , and laughed at Judah as she went away into exile ,
26:25:004:0	I will allow nomads from the eastern deserts to overrun your country . They will set up their camps among you and pitch their tents on your land . They will harvest all your fruit and drink the milk from your livestock .
26:25:005:0	And I will turn the city of Rabbah into a pasture for camels , and all the land of the Ammonites into a resting place for sheep and goats . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:25:006:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because you clapped and danced and cheered with glee at the destruction of my people ,
26:25:002:1	A Message for Moab
26:25:007:0	I will raise my fist of judgment against you . I will give you as plunder to many nations . I will cut you off from being a nation and destroy you completely . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:25:008:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because the people of Moab have said that Judah is just like all the other nations ,
26:25:009:0	I will open up their eastern flank and wipe out their glorious frontier towns — Beth-jeshimoth , Baal-meon , and Kiriathaim .
26:25:010:0	And I will hand Moab over to nomads from the eastern deserts , just as I handed over Ammon . Yes , the Ammonites will no longer be counted among the nations .
26:25:003:1	A Message for Edom
26:25:011:0	In the same way , I will bring my judgment down on the Moabites . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
26:25:012:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : The people of Edom have sinned greatly by avenging themselves against the people of Judah .
26:25:013:0	Therefore , says the Sovereign Lord , I will raise my fist of judgment against Edom . I will wipe out its people and animals with the sword . I will make a wasteland of everything from Teman to Dedan .
26:25:004:1	A Message for Philistia
26:25:014:0	I will accomplish this by the hand of my people of Israel . They will carry out my vengeance with anger , and Edom will know that this vengeance is from me . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken !
26:25:015:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : The people of Philistia have acted against Judah out of bitter revenge and long-standing contempt .
26:25:016:0	Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will raise my fist of judgment against the land of the Philistines . I will wipe out the Kerethites and utterly destroy the people who live by the sea .
26:25:017:0	I will execute terrible vengeance against them to punish them for what they have done . And when I have inflicted my revenge , they will know that I am the Lord . ”
