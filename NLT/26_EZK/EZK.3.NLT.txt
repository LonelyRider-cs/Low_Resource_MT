26:3:001:0	The voice said to me , “ Son of man , eat what I am giving you — eat this scroll ! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel . ”
26:3:002:0	So I opened my mouth , and he fed me the scroll .
26:3:003:0	“ Fill your stomach with this , ” he said . And when I ate it , it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth .
26:3:004:0	Then he said , “ Son of man , go to the people of Israel and give them my messages .
26:3:005:0	I am not sending you to a foreign people whose language you can not understand .
26:3:006:0	No , I am not sending you to people with strange and difficult speech . If I did , they would listen !
26:3:007:0	But the people of Israel wo n't listen to you any more than they listen to me ! For the whole lot of them are hard-hearted and stubborn .
26:3:008:0	But look , I have made you as obstinate and hard-hearted as they are .
26:3:009:0	I have made your forehead as hard as the hardest rock ! So do n't be afraid of them or fear their angry looks , even though they are rebels . ”
26:3:010:0	Then he added , “ Son of man , let all my words sink deep into your own heart first . Listen to them carefully for yourself .
26:3:011:0	Then go to your people in exile and say to them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says ! ' Do this whether they listen to you or not . ”
26:3:012:0	Then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me . ( May the glory of the Lord be praised in his place ! )
26:3:013:0	It was the sound of the wings of the living beings as they brushed against each other and the rumbling of their wheels beneath them .
26:3:014:0	The Spirit lifted me up and took me away . I went in bitterness and turmoil , but the Lord 's hold on me was strong .
26:3:001:1	A Watchman for Israel
26:3:015:0	Then I came to the colony of Judean exiles in Tel-abib , beside the Kebar River . I was overwhelmed and sat among them for seven days .
26:3:016:0	After seven days the Lord gave me a message . He said ,
26:3:017:0	“ Son of man , I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel . Whenever you receive a message from me , warn people immediately .
26:3:018:0	If I warn the wicked , saying , ‘ You are under the penalty of death , ' but you fail to deliver the warning , they will die in their sins . And I will hold you responsible for their deaths .
26:3:019:0	If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning , they will die in their sins . But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me .
26:3:020:0	“ If righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and ignore the obstacles I put in their way , they will die . And if you do not warn them , they will die in their sins . None of their righteous acts will be remembered , and I will hold you responsible for their deaths .
26:3:021:0	But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin , they will live , and you will have saved yourself , too . ”
26:3:022:0	Then the Lord took hold of me and said , “ Get up and go out into the valley , and I will speak to you there . ”
26:3:023:0	So I got up and went , and there I saw the glory of the Lord , just as I had seen in my first vision by the Kebar River . And I fell face down on the ground .
26:3:024:0	Then the Spirit came into me and set me on my feet . He spoke to me and said , “ Go to your house and shut yourself in .
26:3:025:0	There , son of man , you will be tied with ropes so you can not go out among the people .
26:3:026:0	And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them , for they are rebels .
26:3:027:0	But when I give you a message , I will loosen your tongue and let you speak . Then you will say to them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says ! ' Those who choose to listen will listen , but those who refuse will refuse , for they are rebels .
