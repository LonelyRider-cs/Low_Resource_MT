26:8:001:1	Idolatry in the Temple
26:8:001:0	Then on September 17 , during the sixth year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , while the leaders of Judah were in my home , the Sovereign Lord took hold of me .
26:8:002:0	I saw a figure that appeared to be a man . From what appeared to be his waist down , he looked like a burning flame . From the waist up he looked like gleaming amber .
26:8:003:0	He reached out what seemed to be a hand and took me by the hair . Then the Spirit lifted me up into the sky and transported me to Jerusalem in a vision from God . I was taken to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple , where there is a large idol that has made the Lord very jealous .
26:8:004:0	Suddenly , the glory of the God of Israel was there , just as I had seen it before in the valley .
26:8:005:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , look toward the north. ” So I looked , and there to the north , beside the entrance to the gate near the altar , stood the idol that had made the Lord so jealous .
26:8:006:0	“ Son of man , ” he said , “ do you see what they are doing ? Do you see the detestable sins the people of Israel are committing to drive me from my Temple ? But come , and you will see even more detestable sins than these ! ”
26:8:007:0	Then he brought me to the door of the Temple courtyard , where I could see a hole in the wall .
26:8:008:0	He said to me , “ Now , son of man , dig into the wall. ” So I dug into the wall and found a hidden doorway .
26:8:009:0	“ Go in , ” he said , “ and see the wicked and detestable sins they are committing in there ! ”
26:8:010:0	So I went in and saw the walls covered with engravings of all kinds of crawling animals and detestable creatures . I also saw the various idols worshiped by the people of Israel .
26:8:011:0	Seventy leaders of Israel were standing there with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan in the center . Each of them held an incense burner , from which a cloud of incense rose above their heads .
26:8:012:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , have you seen what the leaders of Israel are doing with their idols in dark rooms ? They are saying , ‘ The Lord does n't see us ; he has deserted our land ! ' ”
26:8:013:0	Then the Lord added , “ Come , and I will show you even more detestable sins than these ! ”
26:8:014:0	He brought me to the north gate of the Lord 's Temple , and some women were sitting there , weeping for the god Tammuz .
26:8:015:0	“ Have you seen this ? ” he asked . “ But I will show you even more detestable sins than these ! ”
26:8:016:0	Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the Lord 's Temple . At the entrance to the sanctuary , between the entry room and the bronze altar , there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the sanctuary of the Lord . They were facing east , bowing low to the ground , worshiping the sun !
26:8:017:0	“ Have you seen this , son of man ? ” he asked . “ Is it nothing to the people of Judah that they commit these detestable sins , leading the whole nation into violence , thumbing their noses at me , and provoking my anger ?
26:8:018:0	Therefore , I will respond in fury . I will neither pity nor spare them . And though they cry for mercy , I will not listen . ”
