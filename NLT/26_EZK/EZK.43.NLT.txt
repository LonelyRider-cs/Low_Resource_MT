26:43:001:1	The
26:43:002:1	Lord
26:43:003:1	's Glory Returns
26:43:001:0	After this , the man brought me back around to the east gateway .
26:43:002:0	Suddenly , the glory of the God of Israel appeared from the east . The sound of his coming was like the roar of rushing waters , and the whole landscape shone with his glory .
26:43:003:0	This vision was just like the others I had seen , first by the Kebar River and then when he came to destroy Jerusalem . I fell face down on the ground .
26:43:004:0	And the glory of the Lord came into the Temple through the east gateway .
26:43:005:0	Then the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner courtyard , and the glory of the Lord filled the Temple .
26:43:006:0	And I heard someone speaking to me from within the Temple , while the man who had been measuring stood beside me .
26:43:007:0	The Lord said to me , “ Son of man , this is the place of my throne and the place where I will rest my feet . I will live here forever among the people of Israel . They and their kings will not defile my holy name any longer by their adulterous worship of other gods or by honoring the relics of their kings who have died .
26:43:008:0	They put their idol altars right next to mine with only a wall between them and me . They defiled my holy name by such detestable sin , so I consumed them in my anger .
26:43:009:0	Now let them stop worshiping other gods and honoring the relics of their kings , and I will live among them forever .
26:43:010:0	“ Son of man , describe to the people of Israel the Temple I have shown you , so they will be ashamed of all their sins . Let them study its plan ,
26:43:011:0	and they will be ashamed of what they have done . Describe to them all the specifications of the Temple—including its entrances and exits—and everything else about it . Tell them about its decrees and laws . Write down all these specifications and decrees as they watch so they will be sure to remember and follow them .
26:43:004:1	The Altar
26:43:012:0	And this is the basic law of the Temple : absolute holiness ! The entire top of the mountain where the Temple is built is holy . Yes , this is the basic law of the Temple .
26:43:013:0	“ These are the measurements of the altar : There is a gutter all around the altar 21 inches deep and 21 inches wide , with a curb 9 inches wide around its edge . And this is the height of the altar :
26:43:014:0	From the gutter the altar rises 31/2 feet to a lower ledge that surrounds the altar and is 21 inches wide . From the lower ledge the altar rises 7 feet to the upper ledge that is also 21 inches wide .
26:43:015:0	The top of the altar , the hearth , rises another 7 feet higher , with a horn rising up from each of the four corners .
26:43:016:0	The top of the altar is square , measuring 21 feet by 21 feet .
26:43:017:0	The upper ledge also forms a square , measuring 241/2 feet by 241/2 feet , with a 21-inch gutter and a 101/2-inch curb all around the edge . There are steps going up the east side of the altar . ”
26:43:018:0	Then he said to me , “ Son of man , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : These will be the regulations for the burning of offerings and the sprinkling of blood when the altar is built .
26:43:019:0	At that time , the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok , who minister before me , are to be given a young bull for a sin offering , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:43:020:0	You will take some of its blood and smear it on the four horns of the altar , the four corners of the upper ledge , and the curb that runs around that ledge . This will cleanse and make atonement for the altar .
26:43:021:0	Then take the young bull for the sin offering and burn it at the appointed place outside the Temple area .
26:43:022:0	“ On the second day , sacrifice as a sin offering a young male goat that has no physical defects . Then cleanse and make atonement for the altar again , just as you did with the young bull .
26:43:023:0	When you have finished the cleansing ceremony , offer another young bull that has no defects and a perfect ram from the flock .
26:43:024:0	You are to present them to the Lord , and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord .
26:43:025:0	“ Every day for seven days a male goat , a young bull , and a ram from the flock will be sacrificed as a sin offering . None of these animals may have physical defects of any kind .
26:43:026:0	Do this each day for seven days to cleanse and make atonement for the altar , thus setting it apart for holy use .
26:43:027:0	On the eighth day , and on each day afterward , the priests will sacrifice on the altar the burnt offerings and peace offerings of the people . Then I will accept you . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
