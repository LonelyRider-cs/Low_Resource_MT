26:17:001:1	A Story of Two Eagles
26:17:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:17:002:0	“ Son of man , give this riddle , and tell this story to the people of Israel .
26:17:003:0	Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ A great eagle with broad wings and long feathers , covered with many-colored plumage , came to Lebanon.He seized the top of a cedar tree
26:17:004:0	and plucked off its highest branch.He carried it away to a city filled with merchants.He planted it in a city of traders .
26:17:005:0	He also took a seedling from the landand planted it in fertile soil.He placed it beside a broad river , where it could grow like a willow tree .
26:17:006:0	It took root there andgrew into a low , spreading vine.Its branches turned up toward the eagle , and its roots grew down into the ground.It produced strong branchesand put out shoots .
26:17:007:0	But then another great eagle camewith broad wings and full plumage.So the vine now sent its roots and branchestoward him for water ,
26:17:008:0	even though it was already planted in good soiland had plenty of waterso it could grow into a splendid vineand produce rich leaves and luscious fruit .
26:17:009:0	“ So now the Sovereign Lord asks : Will this vine grow and prosper ? No ! I will pull it up , roots and all ! I will cut off its fruitand let its leaves wither and die.I will pull it up easilywithout a strong arm or a large army .
26:17:002:1	The Riddle Explained
26:17:010:0	But when the vine is transplanted , will it thrive ? No , it will wither awaywhen the east wind blows against it.It will die in the same good soilwhere it had grown so well . ”
26:17:011:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:17:012:0	“ Say to these rebels of Israel : Do n't you understand the meaning of this riddle of the eagles ? The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , took away her king and princes , and brought them to Babylon .
26:17:013:0	He made a treaty with a member of the royal family and forced him to take an oath of loyalty . He also exiled Israel 's most influential leaders ,
26:17:014:0	so Israel would not become strong again and revolt . Only by keeping her treaty with Babylon could Israel survive .
26:17:015:0	“ Nevertheless , this man of Israel 's royal family rebelled against Babylon , sending ambassadors to Egypt to request a great army and many horses . Can Israel break her sworn treaties like that and get away with it ?
26:17:016:0	No ! For as surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , the king of Israel will die in Babylon , the land of the king who put him in power and whose treaty he disregarded and broke .
26:17:017:0	Pharaoh and all his mighty army will fail to help Israel when the king of Babylon lays siege to Jerusalem again and destroys many lives .
26:17:018:0	For the king of Israel disregarded his treaty and broke it after swearing to obey ; therefore , he will not escape .
26:17:019:0	“ So this is what the Sovereign Lord says : As surely as I live , I will punish him for breaking my covenant and disregarding the solemn oath he made in my name .
26:17:020:0	I will throw my net over him and capture him in my snare . I will bring him to Babylon and put him on trial for this treason against me .
26:17:021:0	And all his best warriors will be killed in battle , and those who survive will be scattered to the four winds . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have spoken .
26:17:022:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will take a branch from the top of a tall cedar , and I will plant it on the top of Israel 's highest mountain .
26:17:023:0	It will become a majestic cedar , sending forth its branches and producing seed . Birds of every sort will nest in it , finding shelter in the shade of its branches .
26:17:024:0	And all the trees will know that it is I , the Lord , who cuts the tall tree down and makes the short tree grow tall . It is I who makes the green tree wither and gives the dead tree new life . I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will do what I said ! ”
