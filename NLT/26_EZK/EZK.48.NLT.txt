26:48:001:1	Division of the Land
26:48:001:0	“ Here is the list of the tribes of Israel and the territory each is to receive . The territory of Dan is in the extreme north . Its boundary line follows the Hethlon road to Lebo-hamath and then runs on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus , with Hamath to the north . Dan 's territory extends all the way across the land of Israel from east to west .
26:48:002:0	“ Asher 's territory lies south of Dan 's and also extends from east to west .
26:48:003:0	Naphtali 's land lies south of Asher 's , also extending from east to west .
26:48:004:0	Then comes Manasseh south of Naphtali , and its territory also extends from east to west .
26:48:005:0	South of Manasseh is Ephraim ,
26:48:006:0	and then Reuben ,
26:48:007:0	and then Judah , all of whose boundaries extend from east to west .
26:48:008:0	“ South of Judah is the land set aside for a special purpose . It will be 81/3 miles wide and will extend as far east and west as the tribal territories , with the Temple at the center .
26:48:009:0	“ The area set aside for the Lord 's Temple will be 81/3 miles long and 62/3 miles wide .
26:48:010:0	For the priests there will be a strip of land measuring 81/3 miles long by 31/3 miles wide , with the Lord 's Temple at the center .
26:48:011:0	This area is set aside for the ordained priests , the descendants of Zadok who served me faithfully and did not go astray with the people of Israel and the rest of the Levites .
26:48:012:0	It will be their special portion when the land is distributed , the most sacred land of all . Next to the priests ' territory will lie the land where the other Levites will live .
26:48:013:0	“ The land allotted to the Levites will be the same size and shape as that belonging to the priests—81/3 miles long and 31/3 miles wide . Together these portions of land will measure 81/3 miles long by 62/3 miles wide .
26:48:014:0	None of this special land may ever be sold or traded or used by others , for it belongs to the Lord ; it is set apart as holy .
26:48:015:0	“ An additional strip of land 81/3 miles long by 12/3 miles wide , south of the sacred Temple area , will be allotted for public use—homes , pasturelands , and common lands , with a city at the center .
26:48:016:0	The city will measure 11/2 miles on each side—north , south , east , and west .
26:48:017:0	Open lands will surround the city for 150 yards in every direction .
26:48:018:0	Outside the city there will be a farming area that stretches 31/3 miles to the east and 31/3 miles to the west along the border of the sacred area . This farmland will produce food for the people working in the city .
26:48:019:0	Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may farm it .
26:48:020:0	This entire area—including the sacred lands and the city—is a square that measures 81/3 miles on each side .
26:48:021:0	“ The areas that remain , to the east and to the west of the sacred lands and the city , will belong to the prince . Each of these areas will be 81/3 miles wide , extending in opposite directions to the eastern and western borders of Israel , with the sacred lands and the sanctuary of the Temple in the center .
26:48:022:0	So the prince 's land will include everything between the territories allotted to Judah and Benjamin , except for the areas set aside for the sacred lands and the city .
26:48:023:0	“ These are the territories allotted to the rest of the tribes . Benjamin 's territory lies just south of the prince 's lands , and it extends across the entire land of Israel from east to west .
26:48:024:0	South of Benjamin 's territory lies that of Simeon , also extending across the land from east to west .
26:48:025:0	Next is the territory of Issachar with the same eastern and western boundaries .
26:48:026:0	“ Then comes the territory of Zebulun , which also extends across the land from east to west .
26:48:027:0	The territory of Gad is just south of Zebulun with the same borders to the east and west .
26:48:028:0	The southern border of Gad runs from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh and then follows the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean .
26:48:002:1	The Gates of the City
26:48:029:0	“ These are the allotments that will be set aside for each tribe 's exclusive possession . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken !
26:48:030:0	“ These will be the exits to the city : On the north wall , which is 11/2 miles long ,
26:48:031:0	there will be three gates , each one named after a tribe of Israel . The first will be named for Reuben , the second for Judah , and the third for Levi .
26:48:032:0	On the east wall , also 11/2 miles long , the gates will be named for Joseph , Benjamin , and Dan .
26:48:033:0	The south wall , also 11/2 miles long , will have gates named for Simeon , Issachar , and Zebulun .
26:48:034:0	And on the west wall , also 11/2 miles long , the gates will be named for Gad , Asher , and Naphtali .
26:48:035:0	“ The distance around the entire city will be 6 miles . And from that day the name of the city will be ‘ The Lord Is There . ' ”
