26:28:001:1	A Message for Tyre 's King
26:28:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:28:002:0	“ Son of man , give the prince of Tyre this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ In your great pride you claim , ‘ I am a god ! I sit on a divine throne in the heart of the sea . 'But you are only a man and not a god , though you boast that you are a god .
26:28:003:0	You regard yourself as wiser than Danieland think no secret is hidden from you .
26:28:004:0	With your wisdom and understanding you have amassed great wealth — gold and silver for your treasuries .
26:28:005:0	Yes , your wisdom has made you very rich , and your riches have made you very proud .
26:28:006:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because you think you are as wise as a god ,
26:28:007:0	I will now bring against you a foreign army , the terror of the nations.They will draw their swords against your marvelous wisdomand defile your splendor !
26:28:008:0	They will bring you down to the pit , and you will die in the heart of the sea , pierced with many wounds .
26:28:009:0	Will you then boast , ‘ I am a god ! 'to those who kill you ? To them you will be no godbut merely a man !
26:28:010:0	You will die like an outcastat the hands of foreigners.I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
26:28:011:0	Then this further message came to me from the Lord :
26:28:012:0	“ Son of man , sing this funeral song for the king of Tyre . Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ You were the model of perfection , full of wisdom and exquisite in beauty .
26:28:013:0	You were in Eden , the garden of God.Your clothing was adorned with every precious stone — red carnelian , pale-green peridot , white moonstone , blue-green beryl , onyx , green jasper , blue lapis lazuli , turquoise , and emerald — all beautifully crafted for youand set in the finest gold.They were given to youon the day you were created .
26:28:014:0	I ordained and anointed youas the mighty angelic guardian.You had access to the holy mountain of Godand walked among the stones of fire .
26:28:015:0	“ You were blameless in all you didfrom the day you were createduntil the day evil was found in you .
26:28:016:0	Your rich commerce led you to violence , and you sinned.So I banished you in disgracefrom the mountain of God.I expelled you , O mighty guardian , from your place among the stones of fire .
26:28:017:0	Your heart was filled with pridebecause of all your beauty.Your wisdom was corruptedby your love of splendor.So I threw you to the groundand exposed you to the curious gaze of kings .
26:28:018:0	You defiled your sanctuarieswith your many sins and your dishonest trade.So I brought fire out from within you , and it consumed you.I reduced you to ashes on the groundin the sight of all who were watching .
26:28:002:1	A Message for Sidon
26:28:019:0	All who knew you are appalled at your fate.You have come to a terrible end , and you will exist no more . ”
26:28:020:0	Then another message came to me from the Lord :
26:28:021:0	“ Son of man , turn and face the city of Sidon and prophesy against it .
26:28:022:0	Give the people of Sidon this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ I am your enemy , O Sidon , and I will reveal my glory by what I do to you.When I bring judgment against youand reveal my holiness among you , everyone watching will knowthat I am the Lord .
26:28:023:0	I will send a plague against you , and blood will be spilled in your streets.The attack will come from every direction , and your people will lie slaughtered within your walls.Then everyone will knowthat I am the Lord .
26:28:003:1	Restoration for Israel
26:28:024:0	No longer will Israel 's scornful neighborsprick and tear at her like briers and thorns.For then they will knowthat I am the Sovereign Lord .
26:28:025:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : The people of Israel will again live in their own land , the land I gave my servant Jacob . For I will gather them from the distant lands where I have scattered them . I will reveal to the nations of the world my holiness among my people .
26:28:026:0	They will live safely in Israel and build homes and plant vineyards . And when I punish the neighboring nations that treated them with contempt , they will know that I am the Lord their God . ”
