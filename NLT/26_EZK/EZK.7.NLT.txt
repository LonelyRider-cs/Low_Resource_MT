26:7:001:1	The Coming of the End
26:7:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:7:002:0	“ Son of man , this is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel : “ The end is here ! Wherever you look—east , west , north , or south—your land is finished .
26:7:003:0	No hope remains , for I will unleash my anger against you.I will call you to accountfor all your detestable sins .
26:7:004:0	I will turn my eyes away and show no pity.I will repay you for all your detestable sins.Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:7:005:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Disaster after disasteris coming your way !
26:7:006:0	The end has come.It has finally arrived.Your final doom is waiting !
26:7:007:0	O people of Israel , the day of your destruction is dawning.The time has come ; the day of trouble is near.Shouts of anguish will be heard on the mountains , not shouts of joy .
26:7:008:0	Soon I will pour out my fury on youand unleash my anger against you.I will call you to accountfor all your detestable sins .
26:7:009:0	I will turn my eyes away and show no pity.I will repay you for all your detestable sins.Then you will know that it is I , the Lord , who is striking the blow .
26:7:010:0	“ The day of judgment is here ; your destruction awaits ! The people 's wickedness and pridehave blossomed to full flower .
26:7:011:0	Their violence has grown into a rodthat will beat them for their wickedness.None of these proud and wicked people will survive.All their wealth and prestige will be swept away .
26:7:012:0	Yes , the time has come ; the day is here ! Buyers should not rejoice over bargains , nor sellers grieve over losses , for all of them will fallunder my terrible anger .
26:7:002:1	The Desolation of Israel
26:7:013:0	Even if the merchants survive , they will never return to their business.For what God has said applies to everyone—it will not be changed ! Not one person whose life is twisted by sinwill ever recover .
26:7:014:0	“ The trumpet calls Israel 's army to mobilize , but no one listens , for my fury is against them all .
26:7:015:0	There is war outside the cityand disease and famine within.Those outside the city wallswill be killed by enemy swords.Those inside the citywill die of famine and disease .
26:7:016:0	The survivors who escape to the mountainswill moan like doves , weeping for their sins .
26:7:017:0	Their hands will hang limp , their knees will be weak as water .
26:7:018:0	They will dress themselves in burlap ; horror and shame will cover them.They will shave their headsin sorrow and remorse .
26:7:019:0	“ They will throw their money in the streets , tossing it out like worthless trash.Their silver and gold wo n't save themon that day of the Lord 's anger.It will neither satisfy nor feed them , for their greed can only trip them up .
26:7:020:0	They were proud of their beautiful jewelryand used it to make detestable idols and vile images.Therefore , I will make all their wealthdisgusting to them .
26:7:021:0	I will give it as plunder to foreigners , to the most wicked of nations , and they will defile it .
26:7:022:0	I will turn my eyes from themas these robbers invade and defile my treasured land .
26:7:023:0	“ Prepare chains for my people , for the land is bloodied by terrible crimes.Jerusalem is filled with violence .
26:7:024:0	I will bring the most ruthless of nationsto occupy their homes.I will break down their proud fortressesand defile their sanctuaries .
26:7:025:0	Terror and trembling will overcome my people.They will look for peace but not find it .
26:7:026:0	Calamity will follow calamity ; rumor will follow rumor.They will look in vainfor a vision from the prophets.They will receive no teaching from the priestsand no counsel from the leaders .
26:7:027:0	The king and the prince will stand helpless , weeping in despair , and the people 's handswill tremble with fear.I will bring on themthe evil they have done to others , and they will receive the punishmentthey so richly deserve.Then they will know that I am the Lord . ”
