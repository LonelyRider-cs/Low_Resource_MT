26:16:001:1	Jerusalem—an Unfaithful Wife
26:16:001:0	Then another message came to me from the Lord :
26:16:002:0	“ Son of man , confront Jerusalem with her detestable sins .
26:16:003:0	Give her this message from the Sovereign Lord : You are nothing but a Canaanite ! Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite .
26:16:004:0	On the day you were born , no one cared about you . Your umbilical cord was not cut , and you were never washed , rubbed with salt , and wrapped in cloth .
26:16:005:0	No one had the slightest interest in you ; no one pitied you or cared for you . On the day you were born , you were unwanted , dumped in a field and left to die .
26:16:006:0	“ But I came by and saw you there , helplessly kicking about in your own blood . As you lay there , I said , ‘ Live ! '
26:16:007:0	And I helped you to thrive like a plant in the field . You grew up and became a beautiful jewel . Your breasts became full , and your body hair grew , but you were still naked .
26:16:008:0	And when I passed by again , I saw that you were old enough for love . So I wrapped my cloak around you to cover your nakedness and declared my marriage vows . I made a covenant with you , says the Sovereign Lord , and you became mine .
26:16:009:0	“ Then I bathed you and washed off your blood , and I rubbed fragrant oils into your skin .
26:16:010:0	I gave you expensive clothing of fine linen and silk , beautifully embroidered , and sandals made of fine goatskin leather .
26:16:011:0	I gave you lovely jewelry , bracelets , beautiful necklaces ,
26:16:012:0	a ring for your nose , earrings for your ears , and a lovely crown for your head .
26:16:013:0	And so you were adorned with gold and silver . Your clothes were made of fine linen and costly fabric and were beautifully embroidered . You ate the finest foods—choice flour , honey , and olive oil—and became more beautiful than ever . You looked like a queen , and so you were !
26:16:014:0	Your fame soon spread throughout the world because of your beauty . I dressed you in my splendor and perfected your beauty , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:16:015:0	“ But you thought your fame and beauty were your own . So you gave yourself as a prostitute to every man who came along . Your beauty was theirs for the asking .
26:16:016:0	You used the lovely things I gave you to make shrines for idols , where you played the prostitute . Unbelievable ! How could such a thing ever happen ?
26:16:017:0	You took the very jewels and gold and silver ornaments I had given you and made statues of men and worshiped them . This is adultery against me !
26:16:018:0	You used the beautifully embroidered clothes I gave you to dress your idols . Then you used my special oil and my incense to worship them .
26:16:019:0	Imagine it ! You set before them as a sacrifice the choice flour , olive oil , and honey I had given you , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:16:020:0	“ Then you took your sons and daughters—the children you had borne to me—and sacrificed them to your gods . Was your prostitution not enough ?
26:16:021:0	Must you also slaughter my children by sacrificing them to idols ?
26:16:022:0	In all your years of adultery and detestable sin , you have not once remembered the days long ago when you lay naked in a field , kicking about in your own blood .
26:16:023:0	“ What sorrow awaits you , says the Sovereign Lord . In addition to all your other wickedness ,
26:16:024:0	you built a pagan shrine and put altars to idols in every town square .
26:16:025:0	On every street corner you defiled your beauty , offering your body to every passerby in an endless stream of prostitution .
26:16:026:0	Then you added lustful Egypt to your lovers , provoking my anger with your increasing promiscuity .
26:16:027:0	That is why I struck you with my fist and reduced your boundaries . I handed you over to your enemies , the Philistines , and even they were shocked by your lewd conduct .
26:16:028:0	You have prostituted yourself with the Assyrians , too . It seems you can never find enough new lovers ! And after your prostitution there , you still were not satisfied .
26:16:029:0	You added to your lovers by embracing Babylonia , the land of merchants , but you still were n't satisfied .
26:16:030:0	“ What a sick heart you have , says the Sovereign Lord , to do such things as these , acting like a shameless prostitute .
26:16:031:0	You build your pagan shrines on every street corner and your altars to idols in every square . In fact , you have been worse than a prostitute , so eager for sin that you have not even demanded payment .
26:16:032:0	Yes , you are an adulterous wife who takes in strangers instead of her own husband .
26:16:033:0	Prostitutes charge for their services—but not you ! You give gifts to your lovers , bribing them to come and have sex with you .
26:16:002:1	Judgment on Jerusalem 's Prostitution
26:16:034:0	So you are the opposite of other prostitutes . You pay your lovers instead of their paying you !
26:16:035:0	“ Therefore , you prostitute , listen to this message from the Lord !
26:16:036:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because you have poured out your lust and exposed yourself in prostitution to all your lovers , and because you have worshiped detestable idols , and because you have slaughtered your children as sacrifices to your gods ,
26:16:037:0	this is what I am going to do . I will gather together all your allies—the lovers with whom you have sinned , both those you loved and those you hated—and I will strip you naked in front of them so they can stare at you .
26:16:038:0	I will punish you for your murder and adultery . I will cover you with blood in my jealous fury .
26:16:039:0	Then I will give you to these many nations who are your lovers , and they will destroy you . They will knock down your pagan shrines and the altars to your idols . They will strip you and take your beautiful jewels , leaving you stark naked .
26:16:040:0	They will band together in a mob to stone you and cut you up with swords .
26:16:041:0	They will burn your homes and punish you in front of many women . I will stop your prostitution and end your payments to your many lovers .
26:16:042:0	“ Then at last my fury against you will be spent , and my jealous anger will subside . I will be calm and will not be angry with you anymore .
26:16:043:0	But first , because you have not remembered your youth but have angered me by doing all these evil things , I will fully repay you for all of your sins , says the Sovereign Lord . For you have added lewd acts to all your detestable sins .
26:16:044:0	Everyone who makes up proverbs will say of you , ‘ Like mother , like daughter . '
26:16:045:0	For your mother loathed her husband and her children , and so do you . And you are exactly like your sisters , for they despised their husbands and their children . Truly your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite .
26:16:046:0	“ Your older sister was Samaria , who lived with her daughters in the north . Your younger sister was Sodom , who lived with her daughters in the south .
26:16:047:0	But you have not merely sinned as they did . You quickly surpassed them in corruption .
26:16:048:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , Sodom and her daughters were never as wicked as you and your daughters .
26:16:049:0	Sodom 's sins were pride , gluttony , and laziness , while the poor and needy suffered outside her door .
26:16:050:0	She was proud and committed detestable sins , so I wiped her out , as you have seen .
26:16:051:0	“ Even Samaria did not commit half your sins . You have done far more detestable things than your sisters ever did . They seem righteous compared to you .
26:16:052:0	Shame on you ! Your sins are so terrible that you make your sisters seem righteous , even virtuous .
26:16:053:0	“ But someday I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and Samaria , and I will restore you , too .
26:16:054:0	Then you will be truly ashamed of everything you have done , for your sins make them feel good in comparison .
26:16:055:0	Yes , your sisters , Sodom and Samaria , and all their people will be restored , and at that time you also will be restored .
26:16:056:0	In your proud days you held Sodom in contempt .
26:16:057:0	But now your greater wickedness has been exposed to all the world , and you are the one who is scorned—by Edom and all her neighbors and by Philistia .
26:16:058:0	This is your punishment for all your lewdness and detestable sins , says the Lord .
26:16:059:0	“ Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will give you what you deserve , for you have taken your solemn vows lightly by breaking your covenant .
26:16:060:0	Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you when you were young , and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you .
26:16:061:0	Then you will remember with shame all the evil you have done . I will make your sisters , Samaria and Sodom , to be your daughters , even though they are not part of our covenant .
26:16:062:0	And I will reaffirm my covenant with you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
26:16:063:0	You will remember your sins and cover your mouth in silent shame when I forgive you of all that you have done . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
