26:9:001:1	The Slaughter of Idolaters
26:9:001:0	Then the Lord thundered , “ Bring on the men appointed to punish the city ! Tell them to bring their weapons with them ! ”
26:9:002:0	Six men soon appeared from the upper gate that faces north , each carrying a deadly weapon in his hand . With them was a man dressed in linen , who carried a writer 's case at his side . They all went into the Temple courtyard and stood beside the bronze altar .
26:9:003:0	Then the glory of the God of Israel rose up from between the cherubim , where it had rested , and moved to the entrance of the Temple . And the Lord called to the man dressed in linen who was carrying the writer 's case .
26:9:004:0	He said to him , “ Walk through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of all who weep and sigh because of the detestable sins being committed in their city . ”
26:9:005:0	Then I heard the Lord say to the other men , “ Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked . Show no mercy ; have no pity !
26:9:006:0	Kill them all — old and young , girls and women and little children . But do not touch anyone with the mark . Begin right here at the Temple. ” So they began by killing the seventy leaders .
26:9:007:0	“ Defile the Temple ! ” the Lord commanded . “ Fill its courtyards with corpses . Go ! ” So they went and began killing throughout the city .
26:9:008:0	While they were out killing , I was all alone . I fell face down on the ground and cried out , “ O Sovereign Lord ! Will your fury against Jerusalem wipe out everyone left in Israel ? ”
26:9:009:0	Then he said to me , “ The sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very , very great . The entire land is full of murder ; the city is filled with injustice . They are saying , ‘ The Lord does n't see it ! The Lord has abandoned the land ! '
26:9:010:0	So I will not spare them or have any pity on them . I will fully repay them for all they have done . ”
26:9:011:0	Then the man in linen clothing , who carried the writer 's case , reported back and said , “ I have done as you commanded . ”
