26:42:001:1	Rooms for the Priests
26:42:001:0	Then the man led me out of the Temple courtyard by way of the north gateway . We entered the outer courtyard and came to a group of rooms against the north wall of the inner courtyard .
26:42:002:0	This structure , whose entrance opened toward the north , was 175 feet long and 871/2 feet wide .
26:42:003:0	One block of rooms overlooked the 35-foot width of the inner courtyard . Another block of rooms looked out onto the pavement of the outer courtyard . The two blocks were built three levels high and stood across from each other .
26:42:004:0	Between the two blocks of rooms ran a walkway 171/2 feet wide . It extended the entire 175 feet of the complex , and all the doors faced north .
26:42:005:0	Each of the two upper levels of rooms was narrower than the one beneath it because the upper levels had to allow space for walkways in front of them .
26:42:006:0	Since there were three levels and they did not have supporting columns as in the courtyards , each of the upper levels was set back from the level beneath it .
26:42:007:0	There was an outer wall that separated the rooms from the outer courtyard ; it was 871/2 feet long .
26:42:008:0	This wall added length to the outer block of rooms , which extended for only 871/2 feet , while the inner block—the rooms toward the Temple—extended for 175 feet .
26:42:009:0	There was an eastern entrance from the outer courtyard to these rooms .
26:42:010:0	On the south side of the Temple there were two blocks of rooms just south of the inner courtyard between the Temple and the outer courtyard . These rooms were arranged just like the rooms on the north .
26:42:011:0	There was a walkway between the two blocks of rooms just like the complex on the north side of the Temple . This complex of rooms was the same length and width as the other one , and it had the same entrances and doors . The dimensions of each were identical .
26:42:012:0	So there was an entrance in the wall facing the doors of the inner block of rooms , and another on the east at the end of the interior walkway .
26:42:013:0	Then the man told me , “ These rooms that overlook the Temple from the north and south are holy . Here the priests who offer sacrifices to the Lord will eat the most holy offerings . And because these rooms are holy , they will be used to store the sacred offerings—the grain offerings , sin offerings , and guilt offerings .
26:42:014:0	When the priests leave the sanctuary , they must not go directly to the outer courtyard . They must first take off the clothes they wore while ministering , because these clothes are holy . They must put on other clothes before entering the parts of the building complex open to the public . ”
26:42:015:0	When the man had finished measuring the inside of the Temple area , he led me out through the east gateway to measure the entire perimeter .
26:42:016:0	He measured the east side with his measuring rod , and it was 875 feet long .
26:42:017:0	Then he measured the north side , and it was also 875 feet .
26:42:018:0	The south side was also 875 feet ,
26:42:019:0	and the west side was also 875 feet .
26:42:020:0	So the area was 875 feet on each side with a wall all around it to separate what was holy from what was common .
