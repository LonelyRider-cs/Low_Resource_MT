26:13:001:1	Judgment against False Prophets
26:13:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:13:002:0	“ Son of man , prophesy against the false prophets of Israel who are inventing their own prophecies . Say to them , ‘ Listen to the word of the Lord .
26:13:003:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : What sorrow awaits the false prophets who are following their own imaginations and have seen nothing at all ! '
26:13:004:0	“ O people of Israel , these prophets of yours are like jackals digging in the ruins .
26:13:005:0	They have done nothing to repair the breaks in the walls around the nation . They have not helped it to stand firm in battle on the day of the Lord .
26:13:006:0	Instead , they have told lies and made false predictions . They say , ‘ This message is from the Lord , ' even though the Lord never sent them . And yet they expect him to fulfill their prophecies !
26:13:007:0	Can your visions be anything but false if you claim , ‘ This message is from the Lord , ' when I have not even spoken to you ?
26:13:008:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because what you say is false and your visions are a lie , I will stand against you , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:13:009:0	I will raise my fist against all the prophets who see false visions and make lying predictions , and they will be banished from the community of Israel . I will blot their names from Israel 's record books , and they will never again set foot in their own land . Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord .
26:13:010:0	“ This will happen because these evil prophets deceive my people by saying , ‘ All is peaceful ' when there is no peace at all ! It 's as if the people have built a flimsy wall , and these prophets are trying to reinforce it by covering it with whitewash !
26:13:011:0	Tell these whitewashers that their wall will soon fall down . A heavy rainstorm will undermine it ; great hailstones and mighty winds will knock it down .
26:13:012:0	And when the wall falls , the people will cry out , ‘ What happened to your whitewash ? '
26:13:013:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will sweep away your whitewashed wall with a storm of indignation , with a great flood of anger , and with hailstones of fury .
26:13:014:0	I will break down your wall right to its foundation , and when it falls , it will crush you . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:13:015:0	At last my anger against the wall and those who covered it with whitewash will be satisfied . Then I will say to you : ‘ The wall and those who whitewashed it are both gone .
26:13:002:1	Judgment against False Women Prophets
26:13:016:0	They were lying prophets who claimed peace would come to Jerusalem when there was no peace . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! '
26:13:017:0	“ Now , son of man , speak out against the women who prophesy from their own imaginations .
26:13:018:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : What sorrow awaits you women who are ensnaring the souls of my people , young and old alike . You tie magic charms on their wrists and furnish them with magic veils . Do you think you can trap others without bringing destruction on yourselves ?
26:13:019:0	You bring shame on me among my people for a few handfuls of barley or a piece of bread . By lying to my people who love to listen to lies , you kill those who should not die , and you promise life to those who should not live .
26:13:020:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I am against all your magic charms , which you use to ensnare my people like birds . I will tear them from your arms , setting my people free like birds set free from a cage .
26:13:021:0	I will tear off the magic veils and save my people from your grasp . They will no longer be your victims . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:13:022:0	You have discouraged the righteous with your lies , but I did n't want them to be sad . And you have encouraged the wicked by promising them life , even though they continue in their sins .
26:13:023:0	Because of all this , you will no longer talk of seeing visions that you never saw , nor will you make predictions . For I will rescue my people from your grasp . Then you will know that I am the Lord . ”
