26:20:001:1	The Rebellion of Israel
26:20:001:0	On August 14 , during the seventh year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , some of the leaders of Israel came to request a message from the Lord . They sat down in front of me to wait for his reply .
26:20:002:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:20:003:0	“ Son of man , tell the leaders of Israel , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : How dare you come to ask me for a message ? As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , I will tell you nothing ! '
26:20:004:0	“ Son of man , bring charges against them and condemn them . Make them realize how detestable the sins of their ancestors really were .
26:20:005:0	Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : When I chose Israel — when I revealed myself to the descendants of Jacob in Egypt — I took a solemn oath that I , the Lord , would be their God .
26:20:006:0	I took a solemn oath that day that I would bring them out of Egypt to a land I had discovered and explored for them — a good land , a land flowing with milk and honey , the best of all lands anywhere .
26:20:007:0	Then I said to them , ‘ Each of you , get rid of the vile images you are so obsessed with . Do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt , for I am the Lord your God . '
26:20:008:0	“ But they rebelled against me and would not listen . They did not get rid of the vile images they were obsessed with , or forsake the idols of Egypt . Then I threatened to pour out my fury on them to satisfy my anger while they were still in Egypt .
26:20:009:0	But I did n't do it , for I acted to protect the honor of my name . I would not allow shame to be brought on my name among the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt .
26:20:010:0	So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the wilderness .
26:20:011:0	There I gave them my decrees and regulations so they could find life by keeping them .
26:20:012:0	And I gave them my Sabbath days of rest as a sign between them and me . It was to remind them that I am the Lord , who had set them apart to be holy .
26:20:013:0	“ But the people of Israel rebelled against me , and they refused to obey my decrees there in the wilderness . They would n't obey my regulations even though obedience would have given them life . They also violated my Sabbath days . So I threatened to pour out my fury on them , and I made plans to utterly consume them in the wilderness .
26:20:014:0	But again I held back in order to protect the honor of my name before the nations who had seen my power in bringing Israel out of Egypt .
26:20:015:0	But I took a solemn oath against them in the wilderness . I swore I would not bring them into the land I had given them , a land flowing with milk and honey , the most beautiful place on earth .
26:20:016:0	For they had rejected my regulations , refused to follow my decrees , and violated my Sabbath days . Their hearts were given to their idols .
26:20:017:0	Nevertheless , I took pity on them and held back from destroying them in the wilderness .
26:20:018:0	“ Then I warned their children not to follow in their parents ' footsteps , defiling themselves with their idols .
26:20:019:0	‘ I am the Lord your God , ' I told them . ‘ Follow my decrees , pay attention to my regulations ,
26:20:020:0	and keep my Sabbath days holy , for they are a sign to remind you that I am the Lord your God . '
26:20:021:0	“ But their children , too , rebelled against me . They refused to keep my decrees and follow my regulations , even though obedience would have given them life . And they also violated my Sabbath days . So again I threatened to pour out my fury on them in the wilderness .
26:20:022:0	Nevertheless , I withdrew my judgment against them to protect the honor of my name before the nations that had seen my power in bringing them out of Egypt .
26:20:023:0	But I took a solemn oath against them in the wilderness . I swore I would scatter them among all the nations
26:20:024:0	because they did not obey my regulations . They scorned my decrees by violating my Sabbath days and longing for the idols of their ancestors .
26:20:025:0	I gave them over to worthless decrees and regulations that would not lead to life .
26:20:002:1	Judgment and Restoration
26:20:026:0	I let them pollute themselves with the very gifts I had given them , and I allowed them to give their firstborn children as offerings to their gods — so I might devastate them and remind them that I alone am the Lord .
26:20:027:0	“ Therefore , son of man , give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord : Your ancestors continued to blaspheme and betray me ,
26:20:028:0	for when I brought them into the land I had promised them , they offered sacrifices on every high hill and under every green tree they saw ! They roused my fury as they offered up sacrifices to their gods . They brought their perfumes and incense and poured out their liquid offerings to them .
26:20:029:0	I said to them , ‘ What is this high place where you are going ? ' ( This kind of pagan shrine has been called Bamah — ‘ high place ' — ever since . )
26:20:030:0	“ Therefore , give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord : Do you plan to pollute yourselves just as your ancestors did ? Do you intend to keep prostituting yourselves by worshiping vile images ?
26:20:031:0	For when you offer gifts to them and give your little children to be burned as sacrifices , you continue to pollute yourselves with idols to this day . Should I allow you to ask for a message from me , O people of Israel ? As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , I will tell you nothing .
26:20:032:0	“ You say , ‘ We want to be like the nations all around us , who serve idols of wood and stone . ' But what you have in mind will never happen .
26:20:033:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , I will rule over you with an iron fist in great anger and with awesome power .
26:20:034:0	And in anger I will reach out with my strong hand and powerful arm , and I will bring you back from the lands where you are scattered .
26:20:035:0	I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations , and there I will judge you face to face .
26:20:036:0	I will judge you there just as I did your ancestors in the wilderness after bringing them out of Egypt , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:20:037:0	I will examine you carefully and hold you to the terms of the covenant .
26:20:038:0	I will purge you of all those who rebel and revolt against me . I will bring them out of the countries where they are in exile , but they will never enter the land of Israel . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:20:039:0	“ As for you , O people of Israel , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Go right ahead and worship your idols , but sooner or later you will obey me and will stop bringing shame on my holy name by worshiping idols .
26:20:040:0	For on my holy mountain , the great mountain of Israel , says the Sovereign Lord , the people of Israel will someday worship me , and I will accept them . There I will require that you bring me all your offerings and choice gifts and sacrifices .
26:20:041:0	When I bring you home from exile , you will be like a pleasing sacrifice to me . And I will display my holiness through you as all the nations watch .
26:20:042:0	Then when I have brought you home to the land I promised with a solemn oath to give to your ancestors , you will know that I am the Lord .
26:20:043:0	You will look back on all the ways you defiled yourselves and will hate yourselves because of the evil you have done .
26:20:003:1	Judgment against the Negev
26:20:044:0	You will know that I am the Lord , O people of Israel , when I have honored my name by treating you mercifully in spite of your wickedness . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
26:20:045:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:20:046:0	“ Son of man , turn and face the south and speak out against it ; prophesy against the brushlands of the Negev .
26:20:047:0	Tell the southern wilderness , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Hear the word of the Lord ! I will set you on fire , and every tree , both green and dry , will be burned . The terrible flames will not be quenched and will scorch everything from south to north .
26:20:048:0	And everyone in the world will see that I , the Lord , have set this fire . It will not be put out . ' ”
26:20:049:0	Then I said , “ O Sovereign Lord , they are saying of me , ‘ He only talks in riddles ! ' ”
