26:30:001:1	A Sad Day for Egypt
26:30:001:0	This is another message that came to me from the Lord :
26:30:002:0	“ Son of man , prophesy and give this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ Weep and wailfor that day ,
26:30:003:0	for the terrible day is almost here — the day of the Lord ! It is a day of clouds and gloom , a day of despair for the nations .
26:30:004:0	A sword will come against Egypt , and those who are slaughtered will cover the ground.Its wealth will be carried awayand its foundations destroyed.The land of Ethiopia will be ravished .
26:30:005:0	Ethiopia , Libya , Lydia , all Arabia , and all their other allieswill be destroyed in that war .
26:30:006:0	“ For this is what the Lord says : All of Egypt 's allies will fall , and the pride of her power will end.From Migdol to Aswanthey will be slaughtered by the sword , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:30:007:0	Egypt will be desolate , surrounded by desolate nations , and its cities will be in ruins , surrounded by other ruined cities .
26:30:008:0	And the people of Egypt will know that I am the Lordwhen I have set Egypt on fireand destroyed all their allies .
26:30:009:0	At that time I will send swift messengers in shipsto terrify the complacent Ethiopians.Great panic will come upon themon that day of Egypt 's certain destruction.Watch for it ! It is sure to come !
26:30:010:0	“ For this is what the Sovereign Lord says : By the power of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , I will destroy the hordes of Egypt .
26:30:011:0	He and his armies — the most ruthless of all — will be sent to demolish the land.They will make war against Egyptuntil slaughtered Egyptians cover the ground .
26:30:012:0	I will dry up the Nile Riverand sell the land to wicked men.I will destroy the land of Egypt and everything in itby the hands of foreigners.I , the Lord , have spoken !
26:30:013:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will smash the idols of Egyptand the images at Memphis.There will be no rulers left in Egypt ; terror will sweep the land .
26:30:014:0	I will destroy southern Egypt , set fire to Zoan , and bring judgment against Thebes .
26:30:015:0	I will pour out my fury on Pelusium , the strongest fortress of Egypt , and I will stamp outthe hordes of Thebes .
26:30:016:0	Yes , I will set fire to all Egypt ! Pelusium will be racked with pain ; Thebes will be torn apart ; Memphis will live in constant terror .
26:30:017:0	The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will die in battle , and the women will be taken away as slaves .
26:30:018:0	When I come to break the proud strength of Egypt , it will be a dark day for Tahpanhes , too.A dark cloud will cover Tahpanhes , and its daughters will be led away as captives .
26:30:002:1	The Broken Arms of Pharaoh
26:30:019:0	And so I will greatly punish Egypt , and they will know that I am the Lord . ”
26:30:020:0	On April 29 , during the eleventh year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:30:021:0	“ Son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . His arm has not been put in a cast so that it may heal . Neither has it been bound up with a splint to make it strong enough to hold a sword .
26:30:022:0	Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I am the enemy of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt ! I will break both of his arms — the good arm along with the broken one — and I will make his sword clatter to the ground .
26:30:023:0	I will scatter the Egyptians to many lands throughout the world .
26:30:024:0	I will strengthen the arms of Babylon 's king and put my sword in his hand . But I will break the arms of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and he will lie there mortally wounded , groaning in pain .
26:30:025:0	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , while the arms of Pharaoh fall useless to his sides . And when I put my sword in the hand of Babylon 's king and he brings it against the land of Egypt , Egypt will know that I am the Lord .
26:30:026:0	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , dispersing them throughout the earth . Then they will know that I am the Lord . ”
