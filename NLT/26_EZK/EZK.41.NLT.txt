26:41:001:0	After that , the man brought me into the sanctuary of the Temple . He measured the walls on either side of its doorway , and they were 101/2 feet thick .
26:41:002:0	The doorway was 171/2 feet wide , and the walls on each side of it were 83/4 feet long . The sanctuary itself was 70 feet long and 35 feet wide .
26:41:003:0	Then he went beyond the sanctuary into the inner room . He measured the walls on either side of its entrance , and they were 31/2 feet thick . The entrance was 101/2 feet wide , and the walls on each side of the entrance were 121/4 feet long .
26:41:004:0	The inner room of the sanctuary was 35 feet long and 35 feet wide . “ This , ” he told me , “ is the Most Holy Place . ”
26:41:005:0	Then he measured the wall of the Temple , and it was 101/2 feet thick . There was a row of rooms along the outside wall ; each room was 7 feet wide .
26:41:006:0	These side rooms were built in three levels , one above the other , with thirty rooms on each level . The supports for these side rooms rested on exterior ledges on the Temple wall ; they did not extend into the wall .
26:41:007:0	Each level was wider than the one below it , corresponding to the narrowing of the Temple wall as it rose higher . A stairway led up from the bottom level through the middle level to the top level .
26:41:008:0	I saw that the Temple was built on a terrace , which provided a foundation for the side rooms . This terrace was 101/2 feet high .
26:41:009:0	The outer wall of the Temple 's side rooms was 83/4 feet thick . This left an open area between these side rooms
26:41:010:0	and the row of rooms along the outer wall of the inner courtyard . This open area was 35 feet wide , and it went all the way around the Temple .
26:41:011:0	Two doors opened from the side rooms into the terrace yard , which was 83/4 feet wide . One door faced north and the other south .
26:41:012:0	A large building stood on the west , facing the Temple courtyard . It was 1221/2 feet wide and 1571/2 feet long , and its walls were 83/4 feet thick .
26:41:013:0	Then the man measured the Temple , and it was 175 feet long . The courtyard around the building , including its walls , was an additional 175 feet in length .
26:41:014:0	The inner courtyard to the east of the Temple was also 175 feet wide .
26:41:015:0	The building to the west , including its two walls , was also 175 feet wide.The sanctuary , the inner room , and the entry room of the Temple
26:41:016:0	were all paneled with wood , as were the frames of the recessed windows . The inner walls of the Temple were paneled with wood above and below the windows .
26:41:017:0	The space above the door leading into the inner room , and its walls inside and out , were also paneled .
26:41:018:0	All the walls were decorated with carvings of cherubim , each with two faces , and there was a carving of a palm tree between each of the cherubim .
26:41:019:0	One face — that of a man — looked toward the palm tree on one side . The other face — that of a young lion — looked toward the palm tree on the other side . The figures were carved all along the inside of the Temple ,
26:41:020:0	from the floor to the top of the walls , including the outer wall of the sanctuary .
26:41:021:0	There were square columns at the entrance to the sanctuary , and the ones at the entrance of the Most Holy Place were similar .
26:41:022:0	There was an altar made of wood , 51/4 feet high and 31/2 feet across . Its corners , base , and sides were all made of wood . “ This , ” the man told me , “ is the table that stands in the Lord 's presence . ”
26:41:023:0	Both the sanctuary and the Most Holy Place had double doorways ,
26:41:024:0	each with two swinging doors .
26:41:025:0	The doors leading into the sanctuary were decorated with carved cherubim and palm trees , just as on the walls . And there was a wooden roof at the front of the entry room to the Temple .
26:41:026:0	On both sides of the entry room were recessed windows decorated with carved palm trees . The side rooms along the outside wall also had roofs .
