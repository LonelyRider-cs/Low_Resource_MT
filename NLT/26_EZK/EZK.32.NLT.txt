26:32:001:1	A Warning for Pharaoh
26:32:001:0	On March 3 , during the twelfth year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:32:002:0	“ Son of man , mourn for Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and give him this message : “ You think of yourself as a strong young lion among the nations , but you are really just a sea monster , heaving around in your own rivers , stirring up mud with your feet .
26:32:003:0	Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will send many peopleto catch you in my netand haul you out of the water .
26:32:004:0	I will leave you stranded on the land to die.All the birds of the heavens will land on you , and the wild animals of the whole earthwill gorge themselves on you .
26:32:005:0	I will scatter your flesh on the hillsand fill the valleys with your bones .
26:32:006:0	I will drench the earth with your gushing bloodall the way to the mountains , filling the ravines to the brim .
26:32:007:0	When I blot you out , I will veil the heavens and darken the stars.I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon will not give you its light .
26:32:008:0	I will darken the bright stars overheadand cover your land in darkness.I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken !
26:32:009:0	“ I will disturb many hearts when I bring news of your downfall to distant nations you have never seen .
26:32:010:0	Yes , I will shock many lands , and their kings will be terrified at your fate . They will shudder in fear for their lives as I brandish my sword before them on the day of your fall .
26:32:011:0	For this is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ The sword of the king of Babylonwill come against you .
26:32:012:0	I will destroy your hordes with the swords of mighty warriors—the terror of the nations.They will shatter the pride of Egypt , and all its hordes will be destroyed .
26:32:013:0	I will destroy all your flocks and herdsthat graze beside the streams.Never again will people or animalsmuddy those waters with their feet .
26:32:014:0	Then I will let the waters of Egypt become calm again , and they will flow as smoothly as olive oil , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:32:015:0	And when I destroy Egyptand strip you of everything you ownand strike down all your people , then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:32:002:1	Egypt Falls into the Pit
26:32:016:0	Yes , this is the funeral songthey will sing for Egypt.Let all the nations mourn.Let them mourn for Egypt and its hordes.I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
26:32:017:0	On March 17 , during the twelfth year , another message came to me from the Lord :
26:32:018:0	“ Son of man , weep for the hordes of Egypt and for the other mighty nations . For I will send them down to the world below in company with those who descend to the pit .
26:32:019:0	Say to them , ‘ O Egypt , are you lovelier than the other nations ? No ! So go down to the pit and lie there among the outcasts . '
26:32:020:0	The Egyptians will fall with the many who have died by the sword , for the sword is drawn against them . Egypt and its hordes will be dragged away to their judgment .
26:32:021:0	Down in the grave mighty leaders will mockingly welcome Egypt and its allies , saying , ‘ They have come down ; they lie among the outcasts , hordes slaughtered by the sword . '
26:32:022:0	“ Assyria lies there surrounded by the graves of its army , those who were slaughtered by the sword .
26:32:023:0	Their graves are in the depths of the pit , and they are surrounded by their allies . They struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere , but now they have been slaughtered by the sword .
26:32:024:0	“ Elam lies there surrounded by the graves of all its hordes , those who were slaughtered by the sword . They struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere , but now they have descended as outcasts to the world below . Now they lie in the pit and share the shame of those who have gone before them .
26:32:025:0	They have a resting place among the slaughtered , surrounded by the graves of all their hordes . Yes , they terrorized the nations while they lived , but now they lie in shame with others in the pit , all of them outcasts , slaughtered by the sword .
26:32:026:0	“ Meshech and Tubal are there , surrounded by the graves of all their hordes . They once struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere . But now they are outcasts , all slaughtered by the sword .
26:32:027:0	They are not buried in honor like their fallen heroes , who went down to the grave with their weapons—their shields covering their bodies and their swords beneath their heads . Their guilt rests upon them because they brought terror to everyone while they were still alive .
26:32:028:0	“ You too , Egypt , will lie crushed and broken among the outcasts , all slaughtered by the sword .
26:32:029:0	“ Edom is there with its kings and princes . Mighty as they were , they also lie among those slaughtered by the sword , with the outcasts who have gone down to the pit .
26:32:030:0	“ All the princes of the north and the Sidonians are there with others who have died . Once a terror , they have been put to shame . They lie there as outcasts with others who were slaughtered by the sword . They share the shame of all who have descended to the pit .
26:32:031:0	“ When Pharaoh and his entire army arrive , he will take comfort that he is not alone in having his hordes killed , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:32:032:0	Although I have caused his terror to fall upon all the living , Pharaoh and his hordes will lie there among the outcasts who were slaughtered by the sword . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
