26:12:001:1	Signs of the Coming Exile
26:12:001:0	Again a message came to me from the Lord :
26:12:002:0	“ Son of man , you live among rebels who have eyes but refuse to see . They have ears but refuse to hear . For they are a rebellious people .
26:12:003:0	“ So now , son of man , pretend you are being sent into exile . Pack the few items an exile could carry , and leave your home to go somewhere else . Do this right in front of the people so they can see you . For perhaps they will pay attention to this , even though they are such rebels .
26:12:004:0	Bring your baggage outside during the day so they can watch you . Then in the evening , as they are watching , leave your house as captives do when they begin a long march to distant lands .
26:12:005:0	Dig a hole through the wall while they are watching and go out through it .
26:12:006:0	As they watch , lift your pack to your shoulders and walk away into the night . Cover your face so you can not see the land you are leaving . For I have made you a sign for the people of Israel . ”
26:12:007:0	So I did as I was told . In broad daylight I brought my pack outside , filled with the things I might carry into exile . Then in the evening while the people looked on , I dug through the wall with my hands and went out into the night with my pack on my shoulder .
26:12:008:0	The next morning this message came to me from the Lord :
26:12:009:0	“ Son of man , these rebels , the people of Israel , have asked you what all this means .
26:12:010:0	Say to them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : These actions contain a message for King Zedekiah in Jerusalem and for all the people of Israel . '
26:12:011:0	Explain that your actions are a sign to show what will soon happen to them , for they will be driven into exile as captives .
26:12:012:0	“ Even Zedekiah will leave Jerusalem at night through a hole in the wall , taking only what he can carry with him . He will cover his face , and his eyes will not see the land he is leaving .
26:12:013:0	Then I will throw my net over him and capture him in my snare . I will bring him to Babylon , the land of the Babylonians , though he will never see it , and he will die there .
26:12:014:0	I will scatter his servants and warriors to the four winds and send the sword after them .
26:12:015:0	And when I scatter them among the nations , they will know that I am the Lord .
26:12:016:0	But I will spare a few of them from death by war , famine , or disease , so they can confess all their detestable sins to their captors . Then they will know that I am the Lord . ”
26:12:017:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:12:018:0	“ Son of man , tremble as you eat your food . Shake with fear as you drink your water .
26:12:019:0	Tell the people , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says concerning those living in Israel and Jerusalem : They will eat their food with trembling and sip their water in despair , for their land will be stripped bare because of their violence .
26:12:002:1	A New Proverb for Israel
26:12:020:0	The cities will be destroyed and the farmland made desolate . Then you will know that I am the Lord . ' ”
26:12:021:0	Again a message came to me from the Lord :
26:12:022:0	“ Son of man , you 've heard that proverb they quote in Israel : ‘ Time passes , and prophecies come to nothing . '
26:12:023:0	Tell the people , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will put an end to this proverb , and you will soon stop quoting it . ' Now give them this new proverb to replace the old one : ‘ The time has come for every prophecy to be fulfilled ! '
26:12:024:0	“ There will be no more false visions and flattering predictions in Israel .
26:12:025:0	For I am the Lord ! If I say it , it will happen . There will be no more delays , you rebels of Israel . I will fulfill my threat of destruction in your own lifetime . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
26:12:026:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:12:027:0	“ Son of man , the people of Israel are saying , ‘ He 's talking about the distant future . His visions wo n't come true for a long , long time . '
26:12:028:0	Therefore , tell them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : No more delay ! I will now do everything I have threatened . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ' ”
