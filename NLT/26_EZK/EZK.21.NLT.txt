26:21:001:1	The
26:21:002:1	Lord
26:21:003:1	's Sword of Judgment
26:21:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:21:002:0	“ Son of man , turn and face Jerusalem and prophesy against Israel and her sanctuaries .
26:21:003:0	Tell her , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I am your enemy , O Israel , and I am about to unsheath my sword to destroy your people—the righteous and the wicked alike .
26:21:004:0	Yes , I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked ! I will draw my sword against everyone in the land from south to north .
26:21:005:0	Everyone in the world will know that I am the Lord . My sword is in my hand , and it will not return to its sheath until its work is finished . '
26:21:006:0	“ Son of man , groan before the people ! Groan before them with bitter anguish and a broken heart .
26:21:007:0	When they ask why you are groaning , tell them , ‘ I groan because of the terrifying news I have heard . When it comes true , the boldest heart will melt with fear ; all strength will disappear . Every spirit will faint ; strong knees will become as weak as water . And the Sovereign Lord says : It is coming ! It 's on its way ! ' ”
26:21:008:0	Then the Lord said to me ,
26:21:009:0	“ Son of man , give the people this message from the Lord : “ A sword , a swordis being sharpened and polished .
26:21:010:0	It is sharpened for terrible slaughterand polished to flash like lightning ! Now will you laugh ? Those far stronger than you have fallen beneath its power !
26:21:011:0	Yes , the sword is now being sharpened and polished ; it is being prepared for the executioner .
26:21:012:0	“ Son of man , cry out and wail ; pound your thighs in anguish , for that sword will slaughter my people and their leaders—everyone will die !
26:21:013:0	It will put them all to the test.What chance do they have ? says the Sovereign Lord .
26:21:014:0	“ Son of man , prophesy to themand clap your hands.Then take the sword and brandish it twice , even three times , to symbolize the great massacre , the great massacre facing them on every side .
26:21:015:0	Let their hearts melt with terror , for the sword glitters at every gate.It flashes like lightningand is polished for slaughter !
26:21:016:0	O sword , slash to the right , then slash to the left , wherever you will , wherever you want .
26:21:004:1	Omens for Babylon 's King
26:21:017:0	I , too , will clap my hands , and I will satisfy my fury.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
26:21:018:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:21:019:0	“ Son of man , make a map and trace two routes on it for the sword of Babylon 's king to follow . Put a signpost on the road that comes out of Babylon where the road forks into two—
26:21:020:0	one road going to Ammon and its capital , Rabbah , and the other to Judah and fortified Jerusalem .
26:21:021:0	The king of Babylon now stands at the fork , uncertain whether to attack Jerusalem or Rabbah . He calls his magicians to look for omens . They cast lots by shaking arrows from the quiver . They inspect the livers of animal sacrifices .
26:21:022:0	The omen in his right hand says , ‘ Jerusalem ! ' With battering rams his soldiers will go against the gates , shouting for the kill . They will put up siege towers and build ramps against the walls .
26:21:023:0	The people of Jerusalem will think it is a false omen , because of their treaty with the Babylonians . But the king of Babylon will remind the people of their rebellion . Then he will attack and capture them .
26:21:024:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Again and again you remind me of your sin and your guilt . You do n't even try to hide it ! In everything you do , your sins are obvious for all to see . So now the time of your punishment has come !
26:21:025:0	“ O you corrupt and wicked prince of Israel , your final day of reckoning is here !
26:21:026:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ Take off your jeweled crown , for the old order changes.Now the lowly will be exalted , and the mighty will be brought down .
26:21:005:1	A Message for the Ammonites
26:21:027:0	Destruction ! Destruction ! I will surely destroy the kingdom.And it will not be restored until the one appearswho has the right to judge it.Then I will hand it over to him .
26:21:028:0	“ And now , son of man , prophesy concerning the Ammonites and their mockery . Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ A sword , a swordis drawn for your slaughter.It is polished to destroy , flashing like lightning !
26:21:029:0	Your prophets have given false visions , and your fortune-tellers have told lies.The sword will fall on the necks of the wickedfor whom the day of final reckoning has come .
26:21:030:0	“ Now return the sword to its sheath , for in your own country , the land of your birth , I will pass judgment upon you .
26:21:031:0	I will pour out my fury on youand blow on you with the fire of my anger.I will hand you over to cruel menwho are skilled in destruction .
26:21:032:0	You will be fuel for the fire , and your blood will be spilled in your own land.You will be utterly wiped out , your memory lost to history , for I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
