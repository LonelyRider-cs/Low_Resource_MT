26:5:001:1	A Sign of the Coming Judgment
26:5:001:0	“ Son of man , take a sharp sword and use it as a razor to shave your head and beard . Use a scale to weigh the hair into three equal parts .
26:5:002:0	Place a third of it at the center of your map of Jerusalem . After acting out the siege , burn it there . Scatter another third across your map and chop it with a sword . Scatter the last third to the wind , for I will scatter my people with the sword .
26:5:003:0	Keep just a bit of the hair and tie it up in your robe .
26:5:004:0	Then take some of these hairs out and throw them into the fire , burning them up . A fire will then spread from this remnant and destroy all of Israel .
26:5:005:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : This is an illustration of what will happen to Jerusalem . I placed her at the center of the nations ,
26:5:006:0	but she has rebelled against my regulations and decrees and has been even more wicked than the surrounding nations . She has refused to obey the regulations and decrees I gave her to follow .
26:5:007:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : You people have behaved worse than your neighbors and have refused to obey my decrees and regulations . You have not even lived up to the standards of the nations around you .
26:5:008:0	Therefore , I myself , the Sovereign Lord , am now your enemy . I will punish you publicly while all the nations watch .
26:5:009:0	Because of your detestable idols , I will punish you like I have never punished anyone before or ever will again .
26:5:010:0	Parents will eat their own children , and children will eat their parents . I will punish you and scatter to the winds the few who survive .
26:5:011:0	“ As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , I will cut you off completely . I will show you no pity at all because you have defiled my Temple with your vile images and detestable sins .
26:5:012:0	A third of your people will die in the city from disease and famine . A third of them will be slaughtered by the enemy outside the city walls . And I will scatter a third to the winds , chasing them with my sword .
26:5:013:0	Then at last my anger will be spent , and I will be satisfied . And when my fury against them has subsided , all Israel will know that I , the Lord , have spoken to them in my jealous anger .
26:5:014:0	“ So I will turn you into a ruin , a mockery in the eyes of the surrounding nations and to all who pass by .
26:5:015:0	You will become an object of mockery and taunting and horror . You will be a warning to all the nations around you . They will see what happens when the Lord punishes a nation in anger and rebukes it , says the Lord .
26:5:016:0	“ I will shower you with the deadly arrows of famine to destroy you . The famine will become more and more severe until every crumb of food is gone .
26:5:017:0	And along with the famine , wild animals will attack you and rob you of your children . Disease and war will stalk your land , and I will bring the sword of the enemy against you . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
