26:44:001:1	The Prince , Levites , and Priests
26:44:001:0	Then the man brought me back to the east gateway in the outer wall of the Temple area , but it was closed .
26:44:002:0	And the Lord said to me , “ This gate must remain closed ; it will never again be opened . No one will ever open it and pass through , for the Lord , the God of Israel , has entered here . Therefore , it must always remain shut .
26:44:003:0	Only the prince himself may sit inside this gateway to feast in the Lord 's presence . But he may come and go only through the entry room of the gateway . ”
26:44:004:0	Then the man brought me through the north gateway to the front of the Temple . I looked and saw that the glory of the Lord filled the Temple of the Lord , and I fell face down on the ground .
26:44:005:0	And the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , take careful notice . Use your eyes and ears , and listen to everything I tell you about the regulations concerning the Lord 's Temple . Take careful note of the procedures for using the Temple 's entrances and exits .
26:44:006:0	And give these rebels , the people of Israel , this message from the Sovereign Lord : O people of Israel , enough of your detestable sins !
26:44:007:0	You have brought uncircumcised foreigners into my sanctuary — people who have no heart for God . In this way , you defiled my Temple even as you offered me my food , the fat and blood of sacrifices . In addition to all your other detestable sins , you have broken my covenant .
26:44:008:0	Instead of safeguarding my sacred rituals , you have hired foreigners to take charge of my sanctuary .
26:44:009:0	“ So this is what the Sovereign Lord says : No foreigners , including those who live among the people of Israel , will enter my sanctuary if they have not been circumcised and have not surrendered themselves to the Lord .
26:44:010:0	And the men of the tribe of Levi who abandoned me when Israel strayed away from me to worship idols must bear the consequences of their unfaithfulness .
26:44:011:0	They may still be Temple guards and gatekeepers , and they may slaughter the animals brought for burnt offerings and be present to help the people .
26:44:012:0	But they encouraged my people to worship idols , causing Israel to fall into deep sin . So I have taken a solemn oath that they must bear the consequences for their sins , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:44:013:0	They may not approach me to minister as priests . They may not touch any of my holy things or the holy offerings , for they must bear the shame of all the detestable sins they have committed .
26:44:014:0	They are to serve as the Temple caretakers , taking charge of the maintenance work and performing general duties .
26:44:015:0	“ However , the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok continued to minister faithfully in the Temple when Israel abandoned me for idols . These men will serve as my ministers . They will stand in my presence and offer the fat and blood of the sacrifices , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:44:016:0	They alone will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to serve me . They will fulfill all my requirements .
26:44:017:0	“ When they enter the gateway to the inner courtyard , they must wear only linen clothing . They must wear no wool while on duty in the inner courtyard or in the Temple itself .
26:44:018:0	They must wear linen turbans and linen undergarments . They must not wear anything that would cause them to perspire .
26:44:019:0	When they return to the outer courtyard where the people are , they must take off the clothes they wear while ministering to me . They must leave them in the sacred rooms and put on other clothes so they do not endanger anyone by transmitting holiness to them through this clothing .
26:44:020:0	“ They must neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow too long . Instead , they must trim it regularly .
26:44:021:0	The priests must not drink wine before entering the inner courtyard .
26:44:022:0	They may choose their wives only from among the virgins of Israel or the widows of the priests . They may not marry other widows or divorced women .
26:44:023:0	They will teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is common , what is ceremonially clean and unclean .
26:44:024:0	“ They will serve as judges to resolve any disagreements among my people . Their decisions must be based on my regulations . And the priests themselves must obey my instructions and decrees at all the sacred festivals , and see to it that the Sabbaths are set apart as holy days .
26:44:025:0	“ A priest must not defile himself by being in the presence of a dead person unless it is his father , mother , child , brother , or unmarried sister . In such cases it is permitted .
26:44:026:0	Even then , he can return to his Temple duties only after being ceremonially cleansed and then waiting for seven days .
26:44:027:0	The first day he returns to work and enters the inner courtyard and the sanctuary , he must offer a sin offering for himself , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:44:028:0	“ The priests will not have any property or possession of land , for I alone am their special possession .
26:44:029:0	Their food will come from the gifts and sacrifices brought to the Temple by the people — the grain offerings , the sin offerings , and the guilt offerings . Whatever anyone sets apart for the Lord will belong to the priests .
26:44:030:0	The first of the ripe fruits and all the gifts brought to the Lord will go to the priests . The first batch of dough must also be given to the priests so the Lord will bless your homes .
26:44:031:0	The priests may not eat meat from any bird or animal that dies a natural death or that dies after being attacked by another animal .
