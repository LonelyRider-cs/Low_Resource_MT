26:14:001:1	The Idolatry of Israel 's Leaders
26:14:001:0	Then some of the leaders of Israel visited me , and while they were sitting with me ,
26:14:002:0	this message came to me from the Lord :
26:14:003:0	“ Son of man , these leaders have set up idols in their hearts . They have embraced things that will make them fall into sin . Why should I listen to their requests ?
26:14:004:0	Tell them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : The people of Israel have set up idols in their hearts and fallen into sin , and then they go to a prophet asking for a message . So I , the Lord , will give them the kind of answer their great idolatry deserves .
26:14:005:0	I will do this to capture the minds and hearts of all my people who have turned from me to worship their detestable idols . '
26:14:006:0	“ Therefore , tell the people of Israel , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Repent and turn away from your idols , and stop all your detestable sins .
26:14:007:0	I , the Lord , will answer all those , both Israelites and foreigners , who reject me and set up idols in their hearts and so fall into sin , and who then come to a prophet asking for my advice .
26:14:008:0	I will turn against such people and make a terrible example of them , eliminating them from among my people . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:14:009:0	“ ‘ And if a prophet is deceived into giving a message , it is because I , the Lord , have deceived that prophet . I will lift my fist against such prophets and cut them off from the community of Israel .
26:14:010:0	False prophets and those who seek their guidance will all be punished for their sins .
26:14:002:1	The Certainty of the
26:14:003:1	Lord
26:14:004:1	's Judgment
26:14:011:0	In this way , the people of Israel will learn not to stray from me , polluting themselves with sin . They will be my people , and I will be their God . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ' ”
26:14:012:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:14:013:0	“ Son of man , suppose the people of a country were to sin against me , and I lifted my fist to crush them , cutting off their food supply and sending a famine to destroy both people and animals .
26:14:014:0	Even if Noah , Daniel , and Job were there , their righteousness would save no one but themselves , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:14:015:0	“ Or suppose I were to send wild animals to invade the country , kill the people , and make the land too desolate and dangerous to pass through .
26:14:016:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , even if those three men were there , they would n't be able to save their own sons or daughters . They alone would be saved , but the land would be made desolate .
26:14:017:0	“ Or suppose I were to bring war against the land , and I sent enemy armies to destroy both people and animals .
26:14:018:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , even if those three men were there , they would n't be able to save their own sons or daughters . They alone would be saved .
26:14:019:0	“ Or suppose I were to pour out my fury by sending an epidemic into the land , and the disease killed people and animals alike .
26:14:020:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , even if Noah , Daniel , and Job were there , they would n't be able to save their own sons or daughters . They alone would be saved by their righteousness .
26:14:021:0	“ Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says : How terrible it will be when all four of these dreadful punishments fall upon Jerusalem—war , famine , wild animals , and disease—destroying all her people and animals .
26:14:022:0	Yet there will be survivors , and they will come here to join you as exiles in Babylon . You will see with your own eyes how wicked they are , and then you will feel better about what I have done to Jerusalem .
26:14:023:0	When you meet them and see their behavior , you will understand that these things are not being done to Israel without cause . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
