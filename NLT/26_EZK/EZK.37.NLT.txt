26:37:001:1	A Valley of Dry Bones
26:37:001:0	The Lord took hold of me , and I was carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a valley filled with bones .
26:37:002:0	He led me all around among the bones that covered the valley floor . They were scattered everywhere across the ground and were completely dried out .
26:37:003:0	Then he asked me , “ Son of man , can these bones become living people again ? ” “ O Sovereign Lord , ” I replied , “ you alone know the answer to that . ”
26:37:004:0	Then he said to me , “ Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say , ‘ Dry bones , listen to the word of the Lord !
26:37:005:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Look ! I am going to put breath into you and make you live again !
26:37:006:0	I will put flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin . I will put breath into you , and you will come to life . Then you will know that I am the Lord . ' ”
26:37:007:0	So I spoke this message , just as he told me . Suddenly as I spoke , there was a rattling noise all across the valley . The bones of each body came together and attached themselves as complete skeletons .
26:37:008:0	Then as I watched , muscles and flesh formed over the bones . Then skin formed to cover their bodies , but they still had no breath in them .
26:37:009:0	Then he said to me , “ Speak a prophetic message to the winds , son of man . Speak a prophetic message and say , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Come , O breath , from the four winds ! Breathe into these dead bodies so they may live again . ' ”
26:37:010:0	So I spoke the message as he commanded me , and breath came into their bodies . They all came to life and stood up on their feet — a great army .
26:37:011:0	Then he said to me , “ Son of man , these bones represent the people of Israel . They are saying , ‘ We have become old , dry bones — all hope is gone . Our nation is finished . '
26:37:012:0	Therefore , prophesy to them and say , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : O my people , I will open your graves of exile and cause you to rise again . Then I will bring you back to the land of Israel .
26:37:013:0	When this happens , O my people , you will know that I am the Lord .
26:37:002:1	Reunion of Israel and Judah
26:37:014:0	I will put my Spirit in you , and you will live again and return home to your own land . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have spoken , and I have done what I said . Yes , the Lord has spoken ! ' ”
26:37:015:0	Again a message came to me from the Lord :
26:37:016:0	“ Son of man , take a piece of wood and carve on it these words : ‘ This represents Judah and its allied tribes . ' Then take another piece and carve these words on it : ‘ This represents Ephraim and the northern tribes of Israel . '
26:37:017:0	Now hold them together in your hand as if they were one piece of wood .
26:37:018:0	When your people ask you what your actions mean ,
26:37:019:0	say to them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will take Ephraim and the northern tribes and join them to Judah . I will make them one piece of wood in my hand . '
26:37:020:0	“ Then hold out the pieces of wood you have inscribed , so the people can see them .
26:37:021:0	And give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : I will gather the people of Israel from among the nations . I will bring them home to their own land from the places where they have been scattered .
26:37:022:0	I will unify them into one nation on the mountains of Israel . One king will rule them all ; no longer will they be divided into two nations or into two kingdoms .
26:37:023:0	They will never again pollute themselves with their idols and vile images and rebellion , for I will save them from their sinful apostasy . I will cleanse them . Then they will truly be my people , and I will be their God .
26:37:024:0	“ My servant David will be their king , and they will have only one shepherd . They will obey my regulations and be careful to keep my decrees .
26:37:025:0	They will live in the land I gave my servant Jacob , the land where their ancestors lived . They and their children and their grandchildren after them will live there forever , generation after generation . And my servant David will be their prince forever .
26:37:026:0	And I will make a covenant of peace with them , an everlasting covenant . I will give them their land and increase their numbers , and I will put my Temple among them forever .
26:37:027:0	I will make my home among them . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
26:37:028:0	And when my Temple is among them forever , the nations will know that I am the Lord , who makes Israel holy . ”
