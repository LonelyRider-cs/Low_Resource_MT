26:45:001:1	Division of the Land
26:45:001:0	“ When you divide the land among the tribes of Israel , you must set aside a section for the Lord as his holy portion . This piece of land will be 81/3 miles long and 62/3 miles wide . The entire area will be holy .
26:45:002:0	A section of this land , measuring 875 feet by 875 feet , will be set aside for the Temple . An additional strip of land 871/2 feet wide is to be left empty all around it .
26:45:003:0	Within the larger sacred area , measure out a portion of land 81/3 miles long and 31/3 miles wide . Within it the sanctuary of the Most Holy Place will be located .
26:45:004:0	This area will be holy , set aside for the priests who minister to the Lord in the sanctuary . They will use it for their homes , and my Temple will be located within it .
26:45:005:0	The strip of sacred land next to it , also 81/3 miles long and 31/3 miles wide , will be a living area for the Levites who work at the Temple . It will be their possession and a place for their towns .
26:45:006:0	“ Adjacent to the larger sacred area will be a section of land 81/3 miles long and 12/3 miles wide . This will be set aside for a city where anyone in Israel can live .
26:45:007:0	“ Two special sections of land will be set apart for the prince . One section will share a border with the east side of the sacred lands and city , and the second section will share a border on the west side . Then the far eastern and western borders of the prince 's lands will line up with the eastern and western boundaries of the tribal areas .
26:45:002:1	Rules for the Princes
26:45:008:0	These sections of land will be the prince 's allotment . Then my princes will no longer oppress and rob my people ; they will assign the rest of the land to the people , giving an allotment to each tribe .
26:45:009:0	“ For this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Enough , you princes of Israel ! Stop your violence and oppression and do what is just and right . Quit robbing and cheating my people out of their land . Stop expelling them from their homes , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:45:010:0	Use only honest weights and scales and honest measures , both dry and liquid .
26:45:011:0	The homer will be your standard unit for measuring volume . The ephah and the bath will each measure one-tenth of a homer .
26:45:003:1	Special Offerings and Celebrations
26:45:012:0	The standard unit for weight will be the silver shekel . One shekel will consist of twenty gerahs , and sixty shekels will be equal to one mina .
26:45:013:0	“ You must give this tax to the prince : one bushel of wheat or barley for every 60 you harvest ,
26:45:014:0	one percent of your olive oil ,
26:45:015:0	and one sheep or goat for every 200 in your flocks in Israel . These will be the grain offerings , burnt offerings , and peace offerings that will make atonement for the people who bring them , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:45:016:0	All the people of Israel must join in bringing these offerings to the prince .
26:45:017:0	The prince will be required to provide offerings that are given at the religious festivals , the new moon celebrations , the Sabbath days , and all other similar occasions . He will provide the sin offerings , burnt offerings , grain offerings , liquid offerings , and peace offerings to purify the people of Israel , making them right with the Lord .
26:45:018:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : In early spring , on the first day of each new year , sacrifice a young bull with no defects to purify the Temple .
26:45:019:0	The priest will take blood from this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple , the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar , and the gateposts at the entrance to the inner courtyard .
26:45:020:0	Do this also on the seventh day of the new year for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance . In this way , you will purify the Temple .
26:45:021:0	“ On the fourteenth day of the first month , you must celebrate the Passover . This festival will last for seven days . The bread you eat during that time must be made without yeast .
26:45:022:0	On the day of Passover the prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and the people of Israel .
26:45:023:0	On each of the seven days of the feast he will prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , consisting of seven young bulls and seven rams without defects . A male goat will also be given each day for a sin offering .
26:45:024:0	The prince will provide a basket of flour as a grain offering and a gallon of olive oil with each young bull and ram .
26:45:025:0	“ During the seven days of the Festival of Shelters , which occurs every year in early autumn , the prince will provide these same sacrifices for the sin offering , the burnt offering , and the grain offering , along with the required olive oil .
