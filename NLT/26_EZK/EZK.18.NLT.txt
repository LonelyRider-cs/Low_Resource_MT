26:18:001:1	The Justice of a Righteous God
26:18:001:0	Then another message came to me from the Lord :
26:18:002:0	“ Why do you quote this proverb concerning the land of Israel : ‘ The parents have eaten sour grapes , but their children 's mouths pucker at the taste ' ?
26:18:003:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , you will not quote this proverb anymore in Israel .
26:18:004:0	For all people are mine to judge — both parents and children alike . And this is my rule : The person who sins is the one who will die .
26:18:005:0	“ Suppose a certain man is righteous and does what is just and right .
26:18:006:0	He does not feast in the mountains before Israel 's idols or worship them . He does not commit adultery or have intercourse with a woman during her menstrual period .
26:18:007:0	He is a merciful creditor , not keeping the items given as security by poor debtors . He does not rob the poor but instead gives food to the hungry and provides clothes for the needy .
26:18:008:0	He grants loans without interest , stays away from injustice , is honest and fair when judging others ,
26:18:009:0	and faithfully obeys my decrees and regulations . Anyone who does these things is just and will surely live , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:18:010:0	“ But suppose that man has a son who grows up to be a robber or murderer and refuses to do what is right .
26:18:011:0	And that son does all the evil things his father would never do — he worships idols on the mountains , commits adultery ,
26:18:012:0	oppresses the poor and helpless , steals from debtors by refusing to let them redeem their security , worships idols , commits detestable sins ,
26:18:013:0	and lends money at excessive interest . Should such a sinful person live ? No ! He must die and must take full blame .
26:18:014:0	“ But suppose that sinful son , in turn , has a son who sees his father 's wickedness and decides against that kind of life .
26:18:015:0	This son refuses to worship idols on the mountains and does not commit adultery .
26:18:016:0	He does not exploit the poor , but instead is fair to debtors and does not rob them . He gives food to the hungry and provides clothes for the needy .
26:18:017:0	He helps the poor , does not lend money at interest , and obeys all my regulations and decrees . Such a person will not die because of his father 's sins ; he will surely live .
26:18:018:0	But the father will die for his many sins — for being cruel , robbing people , and doing what was clearly wrong among his people .
26:18:019:0	“ ‘ What ? ' you ask . ‘ Does n't the child pay for the parent 's sins ? ' No ! For if the child does what is just and right and keeps my decrees , that child will surely live .
26:18:020:0	The person who sins is the one who will die . The child will not be punished for the parent 's sins , and the parent will not be punished for the child 's sins . Righteous people will be rewarded for their own righteous behavior , and wicked people will be punished for their own wickedness .
26:18:021:0	But if wicked people turn away from all their sins and begin to obey my decrees and do what is just and right , they will surely live and not die .
26:18:022:0	All their past sins will be forgotten , and they will live because of the righteous things they have done .
26:18:023:0	“ Do you think that I like to see wicked people die ? says the Sovereign Lord . Of course not ! I want them to turn from their wicked ways and live .
26:18:024:0	However , if righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and start doing sinful things and act like other sinners , should they be allowed to live ? No , of course not ! All their righteous acts will be forgotten , and they will die for their sins .
26:18:025:0	“ Yet you say , ‘ The Lord is n't doing what 's right ! ' Listen to me , O people of Israel . Am I the one not doing what 's right , or is it you ?
26:18:026:0	When righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and start doing sinful things , they will die for it . Yes , they will die because of their sinful deeds .
26:18:027:0	And if wicked people turn from their wickedness , obey the law , and do what is just and right , they will save their lives .
26:18:028:0	They will live because they thought it over and decided to turn from their sins . Such people will not die .
26:18:029:0	And yet the people of Israel keep saying , ‘ The Lord is n't doing what 's right ! ' O people of Israel , it is you who are not doing what 's right , not I .
26:18:030:0	“ Therefore , I will judge each of you , O people of Israel , according to your actions , says the Sovereign Lord . Repent , and turn from your sins . Do n't let them destroy you !
26:18:031:0	Put all your rebellion behind you , and find yourselves a new heart and a new spirit . For why should you die , O people of Israel ?
26:18:032:0	I do n't want you to die , says the Sovereign Lord . Turn back and live !
