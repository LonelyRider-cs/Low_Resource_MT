26:47:001:1	The River of Healing
26:47:001:0	In my vision , the man brought me back to the entrance of the Temple . There I saw a stream flowing east from beneath the door of the Temple and passing to the right of the altar on its south side .
26:47:002:0	The man brought me outside the wall through the north gateway and led me around to the eastern entrance . There I could see the water flowing out through the south side of the east gateway .
26:47:003:0	Measuring as he went , he took me along the stream for 1,750 feet and then led me across . The water was up to my ankles .
26:47:004:0	He measured off another 1,750 feet and led me across again . This time the water was up to my knees . After another 1,750 feet , it was up to my waist .
26:47:005:0	Then he measured another 1,750 feet , and the river was too deep to walk across . It was deep enough to swim in , but too deep to walk through .
26:47:006:0	He asked me , “ Have you been watching , son of man ? ” Then he led me back along the riverbank .
26:47:007:0	When I returned , I was surprised by the sight of many trees growing on both sides of the river .
26:47:008:0	Then he said to me , “ This river flows east through the desert into the valley of the Dead Sea . The waters of this stream will make the salty waters of the Dead Sea fresh and pure .
26:47:009:0	There will be swarms of living things wherever the water of this river flows . Fish will abound in the Dead Sea , for its waters will become fresh . Life will flourish wherever this water flows .
26:47:010:0	Fishermen will stand along the shores of the Dead Sea . All the way from En-gedi to En-eglaim , the shores will be covered with nets drying in the sun . Fish of every kind will fill the Dead Sea , just as they fill the Mediterranean .
26:47:011:0	But the marshes and swamps will not be purified ; they will still be salty .
26:47:002:1	Boundaries for the Land
26:47:012:0	Fruit trees of all kinds will grow along both sides of the river . The leaves of these trees will never turn brown and fall , and there will always be fruit on their branches . There will be a new crop every month , for they are watered by the river flowing from the Temple . The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing . ”
26:47:013:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ Divide the land in this way for the twelve tribes of Israel : The descendants of Joseph will be given two shares of land .
26:47:014:0	Otherwise each tribe will receive an equal share . I took a solemn oath and swore that I would give this land to your ancestors , and it will now come to you as your possession .
26:47:015:0	“ These are the boundaries of the land : The northern border will run from the Mediterranean toward Hethlon , then on through Lebo-hamath to Zedad ;
26:47:016:0	then it will run to Berothah and Sibraim , which are on the border between Damascus and Hamath , and finally to Hazer-hatticon , on the border of Hauran .
26:47:017:0	So the northern border will run from the Mediterranean to Hazar-enan , on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south .
26:47:018:0	“ The eastern border starts at a point between Hauran and Damascus and runs south along the Jordan River between Israel and Gilead , past the Dead Sea and as far south as Tamar . This will be the eastern border .
26:47:019:0	“ The southern border will go west from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh and then follow the course of the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean . This will be the southern border .
26:47:020:0	“ On the west side , the Mediterranean itself will be your border from the southern border to the point where the northern border begins , opposite Lebo-hamath .
26:47:021:0	“ Divide the land within these boundaries among the tribes of Israel .
26:47:022:0	Distribute the land as an allotment for yourselves and for the foreigners who have joined you and are raising their families among you . They will be like native-born Israelites to you and will receive an allotment among the tribes .
26:47:023:0	These foreigners are to be given land within the territory of the tribe with whom they now live . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken !
