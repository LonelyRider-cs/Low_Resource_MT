26:26:001:1	A Message for Tyre
26:26:001:0	On February 3 , during the twelfth year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:26:002:0	“ Son of man , Tyre has rejoiced over the fall of Jerusalem , saying , ‘ Ha ! She who was the gateway to the rich trade routes to the east has been broken , and I am the heir ! Because she has been made desolate , I will become wealthy ! '
26:26:003:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I am your enemy , O Tyre , and I will bring many nations against you , like the waves of the sea crashing against your shoreline .
26:26:004:0	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down its towers . I will scrape away its soil and make it a bare rock !
26:26:005:0	It will be just a rock in the sea , a place for fishermen to spread their nets , for I have spoken , says the Sovereign Lord . Tyre will become the prey of many nations ,
26:26:006:0	and its mainland villages will be destroyed by the sword . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
26:26:007:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : From the north I will bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon against Tyre . He is king of kings and brings his horses , chariots , charioteers , and great army .
26:26:008:0	First he will destroy your mainland villages . Then he will attack you by building a siege wall , constructing a ramp , and raising a roof of shields against you .
26:26:009:0	He will pound your walls with battering rams and demolish your towers with sledgehammers .
26:26:010:0	The hooves of his horses will choke the city with dust , and the noise of the charioteers and chariot wheels will shake your walls as they storm through your broken gates .
26:26:011:0	His horsemen will trample through every street in the city . They will butcher your people , and your strong pillars will topple .
26:26:012:0	“ They will plunder all your riches and merchandise and break down your walls . They will destroy your lovely homes and dump your stones and timbers and even your dust into the sea .
26:26:013:0	I will stop the music of your songs . No more will the sound of harps be heard among your people .
26:26:002:1	The Effect of Tyre 's Destruction
26:26:014:0	I will make your island a bare rock , a place for fishermen to spread their nets . You will never be rebuilt , for I , the Lord , have spoken . Yes , the Sovereign Lord has spoken !
26:26:015:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Tyre : The whole coastline will tremble at the sound of your fall , as the screams of the wounded echo in the continuing slaughter .
26:26:016:0	All the seaport rulers will step down from their thrones and take off their royal robes and beautiful clothing . They will sit on the ground trembling with horror at your destruction .
26:26:017:0	Then they will wail for you , singing this funeral song : “ O famous island city , once ruler of the sea , how you have been destroyed ! Your people , with their naval power , once spread fear around the world .
26:26:018:0	Now the coastlands tremble at your fall.The islands are dismayed as you disappear .
26:26:019:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will make Tyre an uninhabited ruin , like many others . I will bury you beneath the terrible waves of enemy attack . Great seas will swallow you .
26:26:020:0	I will send you to the pit to join those who descended there long ago . Your city will lie in ruins , buried beneath the earth , like those in the pit who have entered the world of the dead . You will have no place of respect here in the land of the living .
26:26:021:0	I will bring you to a terrible end , and you will exist no more . You will be looked for , but you will never again be found . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
