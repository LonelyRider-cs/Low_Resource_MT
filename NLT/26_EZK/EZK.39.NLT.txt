26:39:001:1	The Slaughter of Gog 's Hordes
26:39:001:0	“ Son of man , prophesy against Gog . Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord : I am your enemy , O Gog , ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal .
26:39:002:0	I will turn you around and drive you toward the mountains of Israel , bringing you from the distant north .
26:39:003:0	I will knock the bow from your left hand and the arrows from your right hand , and I will leave you helpless .
26:39:004:0	You and your army and your allies will all die on the mountains . I will feed you to the vultures and wild animals .
26:39:005:0	You will fall in the open fields , for I have spoken , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:39:006:0	And I will rain down fire on Magog and on all your allies who live safely on the coasts . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
26:39:007:0	“ In this way , I will make known my holy name among my people of Israel . I will not let anyone bring shame on it . And the nations , too , will know that I am the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
26:39:008:0	That day of judgment will come , says the Sovereign Lord . Everything will happen just as I have declared it .
26:39:009:0	“ Then the people in the towns of Israel will go out and pick up your small and large shields , bows and arrows , javelins and spears , and they will use them for fuel . There will be enough to last them seven years !
26:39:010:0	They wo n't need to cut wood from the fields or forests , for these weapons will give them all the fuel they need . They will plunder those who planned to plunder them , and they will rob those who planned to rob them , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:39:011:0	“ And I will make a vast graveyard for Gog and his hordes in the Valley of the Travelers , east of the Dead Sea . It will block the way of those who travel there , and they will change the name of the place to the Valley of Gog 's Hordes .
26:39:012:0	It will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury the bodies and cleanse the land .
26:39:013:0	Everyone in Israel will help , for it will be a glorious victory for Israel when I demonstrate my glory on that day , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:39:014:0	“ After seven months , teams of men will be appointed to search the land for skeletons to bury , so the land will be made clean again .
26:39:015:0	Whenever bones are found , a marker will be set up so the burial crews will take them to be buried in the Valley of Gog 's Hordes .
26:39:016:0	( There will be a town there named Hamonah , which means ‘ horde . ' ) And so the land will finally be cleansed .
26:39:017:0	“ And now , son of man , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : Call all the birds and wild animals . Say to them : Gather together for my great sacrificial feast . Come from far and near to the mountains of Israel , and there eat flesh and drink blood !
26:39:018:0	Eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of princes as though they were rams , lambs , goats , and bulls—all fattened animals from Bashan !
26:39:019:0	Gorge yourselves with flesh until you are glutted ; drink blood until you are drunk . This is the sacrificial feast I have prepared for you .
26:39:020:0	Feast at my banquet table—feast on horses and charioteers , on mighty men and all kinds of valiant warriors , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:39:021:0	“ In this way , I will demonstrate my glory to the nations . Everyone will see the punishment I have inflicted on them and the power of my fist when I strike .
26:39:022:0	And from that time on the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God .
26:39:023:0	The nations will then know why Israel was sent away to exile—it was punishment for sin , for they were unfaithful to their God . Therefore , I turned away from them and let their enemies destroy them .
26:39:002:1	Restoration for God 's People
26:39:024:0	I turned my face away and punished them because of their defilement and their sins .
26:39:025:0	“ So now , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will end the captivity of my people ; I will have mercy on all Israel , for I jealously guard my holy reputation !
26:39:026:0	They will accept responsibility for their past shame and unfaithfulness after they come home to live in peace in their own land , with no one to bother them .
26:39:027:0	When I bring them home from the lands of their enemies , I will display my holiness among them for all the nations to see .
26:39:028:0	Then my people will know that I am the Lord their God , because I sent them away to exile and brought them home again . I will leave none of my people behind .
26:39:029:0	And I will never again turn my face from them , for I will pour out my Spirit upon the people of Israel . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
