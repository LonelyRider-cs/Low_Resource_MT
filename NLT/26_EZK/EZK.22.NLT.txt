26:22:001:1	The Sins of Jerusalem
26:22:001:0	Now this message came to me from the Lord :
26:22:002:0	“ Son of man , are you ready to judge Jerusalem ? Are you ready to judge this city of murderers ? Publicly denounce her detestable sins ,
26:22:003:0	and give her this message from the Sovereign Lord : O city of murderers , doomed and damned — city of idols , filthy and foul —
26:22:004:0	you are guilty because of the blood you have shed . You are defiled because of the idols you have made . Your day of destruction has come ! You have reached the end of your years . I will make you an object of mockery throughout the world .
26:22:005:0	O infamous city , filled with confusion , you will be mocked by people far and near .
26:22:006:0	“ Every leader in Israel who lives within your walls is bent on murder .
26:22:007:0	Fathers and mothers are treated with contempt . Foreigners are forced to pay for protection . Orphans and widows are wronged and oppressed among you .
26:22:008:0	You despise my holy things and violate my Sabbath days of rest .
26:22:009:0	People accuse others falsely and send them to their death . You are filled with idol worshipers and people who do obscene things .
26:22:010:0	Men sleep with their fathers ' wives and force themselves on women who are menstruating .
26:22:011:0	Within your walls live men who commit adultery with their neighbors ' wives , who defile their daughters-in-law , or who rape their own sisters .
26:22:012:0	There are hired murderers , loan racketeers , and extortioners everywhere . They never even think of me and my commands , says the Sovereign Lord .
26:22:013:0	“ But now I clap my hands in indignation over your dishonest gain and bloodshed .
26:22:014:0	How strong and courageous will you be in my day of reckoning ? I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will do what I said .
26:22:015:0	I will scatter you among the nations and purge you of your wickedness .
26:22:002:1	The
26:22:003:1	Lord
26:22:004:1	's Refining Furnace
26:22:016:0	And when I have been dishonored among the nations because of you , you will know that I am the Lord . ”
26:22:017:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:22:018:0	“ Son of man , the people of Israel are the worthless slag that remains after silver is smelted . They are the dross that is left over — a useless mixture of copper , tin , iron , and lead .
26:22:019:0	So tell them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : Because you are all worthless slag , I will bring you to my crucible in Jerusalem .
26:22:020:0	Just as silver , copper , iron , lead , and tin are melted down in a furnace , I will melt you down in the heat of my fury .
26:22:021:0	I will gather you together and blow the fire of my anger upon you ,
26:22:005:1	The Sins of Israel 's Leaders
26:22:022:0	and you will melt like silver in fierce heat . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have poured out my fury on you . ' ”
26:22:023:0	Again a message came to me from the Lord :
26:22:024:0	“ Son of man , give the people of Israel this message : In the day of my indignation , you will be like a polluted land , a land without rain .
26:22:025:0	Your princes plot conspiracies just as lions stalk their prey . They devour innocent people , seizing treasures and extorting wealth . They make many widows in the land .
26:22:026:0	Your priests have violated my instructions and defiled my holy things . They make no distinction between what is holy and what is not . And they do not teach my people the difference between what is ceremonially clean and unclean . They disregard my Sabbath days so that I am dishonored among them .
26:22:027:0	Your leaders are like wolves who tear apart their victims . They actually destroy people 's lives for money !
26:22:028:0	And your prophets cover up for them by announcing false visions and making lying predictions . They say , ‘ My message is from the Sovereign Lord , ' when the Lord has n't spoken a single word to them .
26:22:029:0	Even common people oppress the poor , rob the needy , and deprive foreigners of justice .
26:22:030:0	“ I looked for someone who might rebuild the wall of righteousness that guards the land . I searched for someone to stand in the gap in the wall so I would n't have to destroy the land , but I found no one .
26:22:031:0	So now I will pour out my fury on them , consuming them with the fire of my anger . I will heap on their heads the full penalty for all their sins . I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken ! ”
