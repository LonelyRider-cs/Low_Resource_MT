26:29:001:1	A Message for Egypt
26:29:001:0	On January 7 , during the tenth year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:29:002:0	“ Son of man , turn and face Egypt and prophesy against Pharaoh the king and all the people of Egypt .
26:29:003:0	Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ I am your enemy , O Pharaoh , king of Egypt—you great monster , lurking in the streams of the Nile.For you have said , ‘ The Nile River is mine ; I made it for myself . '
26:29:004:0	I will put hooks in your jawsand drag you out on the landwith fish sticking to your scales .
26:29:005:0	I will leave you and all your fishstranded in the wilderness to die.You will lie unburied on the open ground , for I have given you as food to the wild animals and birds .
26:29:006:0	All the people of Egypt will know that I am the Lord , for to Israel you were just a staff made of reeds .
26:29:007:0	When Israel leaned on you , you splintered and brokeand stabbed her in the armpit.When she put her weight on you , you collapsed , and her legs gave way .
26:29:008:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will bring an army against you , O Egypt , and destroy both people and animals .
26:29:009:0	The land of Egypt will become a desolate wasteland , and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. “ Because you said , ‘ The Nile River is mine ; I made it , '
26:29:010:0	I am now the enemy of both you and your river . I will make the land of Egypt a totally desolate wasteland , from Migdol to Aswan , as far south as the border of Ethiopia .
26:29:011:0	For forty years not a soul will pass that way , neither people nor animals . It will be completely uninhabited .
26:29:012:0	I will make Egypt desolate , and it will be surrounded by other desolate nations . Its cities will be empty and desolate for forty years , surrounded by other ruined cities . I will scatter the Egyptians to distant lands .
26:29:013:0	“ But this is what the Sovereign Lord also says : At the end of the forty years I will bring the Egyptians home again from the nations to which they have been scattered .
26:29:014:0	I will restore the prosperity of Egypt and bring its people back to the land of Pathros in southern Egypt from which they came . But Egypt will remain an unimportant , minor kingdom .
26:29:015:0	It will be the lowliest of all the nations , never again great enough to rise above its neighbors .
26:29:002:1	Nebuchadnezzar to Conquer Egypt
26:29:016:0	“ Then Israel will no longer be tempted to trust in Egypt for help . Egypt 's shattered condition will remind Israel of how sinful she was to trust Egypt in earlier days . Then Israel will know that I am the Sovereign Lord . ”
26:29:017:0	On April 26 , the first day of the new year , during the twenty-seventh year of King Jehoiachin 's captivity , this message came to me from the Lord :
26:29:018:0	“ Son of man , the army of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon fought so hard against Tyre that the warriors ' heads were rubbed bare and their shoulders were raw and blistered . Yet Nebuchadnezzar and his army won no plunder to compensate them for all their work .
26:29:019:0	Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon . He will carry off its wealth , plundering everything it has so he can pay his army .
26:29:020:0	Yes , I have given him the land of Egypt as a reward for his work , says the Sovereign Lord , because he was working for me when he destroyed Tyre .
26:29:021:0	“ And the day will come when I will cause the ancient glory of Israel to revive , and then , Ezekiel , your words will be respected . Then they will know that I am the Lord . ”
