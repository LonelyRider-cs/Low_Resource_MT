26:35:001:1	A Message for Edom
26:35:001:0	Again a message came to me from the Lord :
26:35:002:0	“ Son of man , turn and face Mount Seir , and prophesy against its people .
26:35:003:0	Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ I am your enemy , O Mount Seir , and I will raise my fist against youto destroy you completely .
26:35:004:0	I will demolish your citiesand make you desolate.Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:35:005:0	“ Your eternal hatred for the people of Israel led you to butcher them when they were helpless , when I had already punished them for all their sins .
26:35:006:0	As surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , since you show no distaste for blood , I will give you a bloodbath of your own . Your turn has come !
26:35:007:0	I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate , killing off all who try to escape and any who return .
26:35:008:0	I will fill your mountains with the dead . Your hills , your valleys , and your ravines will be filled with people slaughtered by the sword .
26:35:009:0	I will make you desolate forever . Your cities will never be rebuilt . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
26:35:010:0	“ For you said , ‘ The lands of Israel and Judah will be ours . We will take possession of them . What do we care that the Lord is there ! '
26:35:011:0	Therefore , as surely as I live , says the Sovereign Lord , I will pay back your angry deeds with my own . I will punish you for all your acts of anger , envy , and hatred . And I will make myself known to Israel by what I do to you .
26:35:012:0	Then you will know that I , the Lord , have heard every contemptuous word you spoke against the mountains of Israel . For you said , ‘ They are desolate ; they have been given to us as food to eat ! '
26:35:013:0	In saying that , you boasted proudly against me , and I have heard it all !
26:35:014:0	“ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : The whole world will rejoice when I make you desolate .
26:35:015:0	You rejoiced at the desolation of Israel 's territory . Now I will rejoice at yours ! You will be wiped out , you people of Mount Seir and all who live in Edom ! Then you will know that I am the Lord .
