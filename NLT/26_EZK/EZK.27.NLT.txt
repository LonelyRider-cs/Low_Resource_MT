26:27:001:1	The End of Tyre 's Glory
26:27:001:0	Then this message came to me from the Lord :
26:27:002:0	“ Son of man , sing a funeral song for Tyre ,
26:27:003:0	that mighty gateway to the sea , the trading center of the world . Give Tyre this message from the Sovereign Lord : “ You boasted , O Tyre , ‘ My beauty is perfect ! '
26:27:004:0	You extended your boundaries into the sea.Your builders made your beauty perfect .
26:27:005:0	You were like a great shipbuilt of the finest cypress from Senir.They took a cedar from Lebanonto make a mast for you .
26:27:006:0	They carved your oarsfrom the oaks of Bashan.Your deck of pine from the coasts of Cypruswas inlaid with ivory .
26:27:007:0	Your sails were made of Egypt 's finest linen , and they flew as a banner above you.You stood beneath blue and purple awningsmade bright with dyes from the coasts of Elishah .
26:27:008:0	Your oarsmen came from Sidon and Arvad ; your helmsmen were skilled men from Tyre itself .
26:27:009:0	Wise old craftsmen from Gebal did the caulking.Ships from every land came with goods to barter for your trade .
26:27:010:0	“ Men from distant Persia , Lydia , and Libya served in your great army . They hung their shields and helmets on your walls , giving you great honor .
26:27:011:0	Men from Arvad and Helech stood on your walls . Your towers were manned by men from Gammad . Their shields hung on your walls , completing your beauty .
26:27:012:0	“ Tarshish sent merchants to buy your wares in exchange for silver , iron , tin , and lead .
26:27:013:0	Merchants from Greece , Tubal , and Meshech brought slaves and articles of bronze to trade with you .
26:27:014:0	“ From Beth-togarmah came riding horses , chariot horses , and mules , all in exchange for your goods .
26:27:015:0	Merchants came to you from Dedan . Numerous coastlands were your captive markets ; they brought payment in ivory tusks and ebony wood .
26:27:016:0	“ Syria sent merchants to buy your rich variety of goods . They traded turquoise , purple dyes , embroidery , fine linen , and jewelry of coral and rubies .
26:27:017:0	Judah and Israel traded for your wares , offering wheat from Minnith , figs , honey , olive oil , and balm .
26:27:018:0	“ Damascus sent merchants to buy your rich variety of goods , bringing wine from Helbon and white wool from Zahar .
26:27:019:0	Greeks from Uzal came to trade for your merchandise . Wrought iron , cassia , and fragrant calamus were bartered for your wares .
26:27:020:0	“ Dedan sent merchants to trade their expensive saddle blankets with you .

26:27:022:0	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah came with all kinds of spices , jewels , and gold in exchange for your wares .
26:27:023:0	“ Haran , Canneh , Eden , Sheba , Asshur , and Kilmad came with their merchandise , too .
26:27:024:0	They brought choice fabrics to trade — blue cloth , embroidery , and multicolored carpets rolled up and bound with cords .
26:27:002:1	The Destruction of Tyre
26:27:025:0	The ships of Tarshish were your ocean caravans . Your island warehouse was filled to the brim !
26:27:026:0	“ But look ! Your oarsmenhave taken you into stormy seas ! A mighty eastern galehas wrecked you in the heart of the sea !
26:27:027:0	Everything is lost — your riches and wares , your sailors and pilots , your ship builders , merchants , and warriors.On the day of your ruin , everyone on board sinks into the depths of the sea .
26:27:028:0	Your cities by the sea trembleas your pilots cry out in terror .
26:27:029:0	All the oarsmen abandon their ships ; the sailors and pilots stand on the shore .
26:27:030:0	They cry aloud over youand weep bitterly.They throw dust on their headsand roll in ashes .
26:27:031:0	They shave their heads in grief for youand dress themselves in burlap.They weep for you with bitter anguishand deep mourning .
26:27:032:0	As they wail and mourn over you , they sing this sad funeral song : ‘ Was there ever such a city as Tyre , now silent at the bottom of the sea ?
26:27:033:0	The merchandise you tradedsatisfied the desires of many nations.Kings at the ends of the earthwere enriched by your trade .
26:27:034:0	Now you are a wrecked ship , broken at the bottom of the sea.All your merchandise and crewhave gone down with you .
26:27:035:0	All who live along the coastlandsare appalled at your terrible fate.Their kings are filled with horrorand look on with twisted faces .
26:27:036:0	The merchants among the nationsshake their heads at the sight of you , for you have come to a horrible endand will exist no more . ' ”
