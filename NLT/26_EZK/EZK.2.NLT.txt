26:2:001:1	Ezekiel 's Call and Commission
26:2:001:0	“ Stand up , son of man , ” said the voice . “ I want to speak with you . ”
26:2:002:0	The Spirit came into me as he spoke , and he set me on my feet . I listened carefully to his words .
26:2:003:0	“ Son of man , ” he said , “ I am sending you to the nation of Israel , a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me . They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day .
26:2:004:0	They are a stubborn and hard-hearted people . But I am sending you to say to them , ‘ This is what the Sovereign Lord says ! '
26:2:005:0	And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for remember , they are rebels—at least they will know they have had a prophet among them .
26:2:006:0	“ Son of man , do not fear them or their words . Do n't be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions . Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls , even though they are rebels .
26:2:007:0	You must give them my messages whether they listen or not . But they wo n't listen , for they are completely rebellious !
26:2:008:0	Son of man , listen to what I say to you . Do not join them in their rebellion . Open your mouth , and eat what I give you . ”
26:2:009:0	Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me . It held a scroll ,
26:2:010:0	which he unrolled . And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs , words of sorrow , and pronouncements of doom .
