26:40:001:1	The New Temple Area
26:40:001:0	On April 28 , during the twenty-fifth year of our captivity — fourteen years after the fall of Jerusalem — the Lord took hold of me .
26:40:002:0	In a vision from God he took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain . From there I could see toward the south what appeared to be a city .
26:40:003:0	As he brought me nearer , I saw a man whose face shone like bronze standing beside a gateway entrance . He was holding in his hand a linen measuring cord and a measuring rod .
26:40:002:1	The East Gateway
26:40:004:0	He said to me , “ Son of man , watch and listen . Pay close attention to everything I show you . You have been brought here so I can show you many things . Then you will return to the people of Israel and tell them everything you have seen . ”
26:40:005:0	I could see a wall completely surrounding the Temple area . The man took a measuring rod that was 101/2 feet long and measured the wall , and the wall was 101/2 feet thick and 101/2 feet high .
26:40:006:0	Then he went over to the eastern gateway . He climbed the steps and measured the threshold of the gateway ; it was 101/2 feet front to back .
26:40:007:0	There were guard alcoves on each side built into the gateway passage . Each of these alcoves was 101/2 feet square , with a distance between them of 83/4 feet along the passage wall . The gateway 's inner threshold , which led to the entry room at the inner end of the gateway passage , was 101/2 feet front to back .
26:40:008:0	He also measured the entry room of the gateway .
26:40:009:0	It was 14 feet across , with supporting columns 31/2 feet thick . This entry room was at the inner end of the gateway structure , facing toward the Temple .
26:40:010:0	There were three guard alcoves on each side of the gateway passage . Each had the same measurements , and the dividing walls separating them were also identical .
26:40:011:0	The man measured the gateway entrance , which was 171/2 feet wide at the opening and 223/4 feet wide in the gateway passage .
26:40:012:0	In front of each of the guard alcoves was a 21-inch curb . The alcoves themselves were 101/2 feet on each side .
26:40:013:0	Then he measured the entire width of the gateway , measuring the distance between the back walls of facing guard alcoves ; this distance was 433/4 feet .
26:40:014:0	He measured the dividing walls all along the inside of the gateway up to the entry room of the gateway ; this distance was 105 feet .
26:40:015:0	The full length of the gateway passage was 871/2 feet from one end to the other .
26:40:003:1	The Outer Courtyard
26:40:016:0	There were recessed windows that narrowed inward through the walls of the guard alcoves and their dividing walls . There were also windows in the entry room . The surfaces of the dividing walls were decorated with carved palm trees .
26:40:017:0	Then the man brought me through the gateway into the outer courtyard of the Temple . A stone pavement ran along the walls of the courtyard , and thirty rooms were built against the walls , opening onto the pavement .
26:40:018:0	This pavement flanked the gates and extended out from the walls into the courtyard the same distance as the gateway entrance . This was the lower pavement .
26:40:004:1	The North Gateway
26:40:019:0	Then the man measured across the Temple 's outer courtyard between the outer and inner gateways ; the distance was 175 feet .
26:40:020:0	The man measured the gateway on the north just like the one on the east .
26:40:021:0	Here , too , there were three guard alcoves on each side , with dividing walls and an entry room . All the measurements matched those of the east gateway . The gateway passage was 871/2 feet long and 433/4 feet wide between the back walls of facing guard alcoves .
26:40:022:0	The windows , the entry room , and the palm tree decorations were identical to those in the east gateway . There were seven steps leading up to the gateway entrance , and the entry room was at the inner end of the gateway passage .
26:40:005:1	The South Gateway
26:40:023:0	Here on the north side , just as on the east , there was another gateway leading to the Temple 's inner courtyard directly opposite this outer gateway . The distance between the two gateways was 175 feet .
26:40:024:0	Then the man took me around to the south gateway and measured its various parts , and they were exactly the same as in the others .
26:40:025:0	It had windows along the walls as the others did , and there was an entry room where the gateway passage opened into the outer courtyard . And like the others , the gateway passage was 871/2 feet long and 433/4 feet wide between the back walls of facing guard alcoves .
26:40:026:0	This gateway also had a stairway of seven steps leading up to it , and an entry room at the inner end , and palm tree decorations along the dividing walls .
26:40:006:1	Gateways to the Inner Courtyard
26:40:027:0	And here again , directly opposite the outer gateway , was another gateway that led into the inner courtyard . The distance between the two gateways was 175 feet .
26:40:028:0	Then the man took me to the south gateway leading into the inner courtyard . He measured it , and it had the same measurements as the other gateways .
26:40:029:0	Its guard alcoves , dividing walls , and entry room were the same size as those in the others . It also had windows along its walls and in the entry room . And like the others , the gateway passage was 871/2 feet long and 433/4 feet wide .
26:40:030:0	( The entry rooms of the gateways leading into the inner courtyard were 14 feet across and 433/4 feet wide . )
26:40:031:0	The entry room to the south gateway faced into the outer courtyard . It had palm tree decorations on its columns , and there were eight steps leading to its entrance .
26:40:032:0	Then he took me to the east gateway leading to the inner courtyard . He measured it , and it had the same measurements as the other gateways .
26:40:033:0	Its guard alcoves , dividing walls , and entry room were the same size as those of the others , and there were windows along the walls and in the entry room . The gateway passage measured 871/2 feet long and 433/4 feet wide .
26:40:034:0	Its entry room faced into the outer courtyard . It had palm tree decorations on its columns , and there were eight steps leading to its entrance .
26:40:035:0	Then he took me around to the north gateway leading to the inner courtyard . He measured it , and it had the same measurements as the other gateways .
26:40:036:0	The guard alcoves , dividing walls , and entry room of this gateway had the same measurements as in the others and the same window arrangements . The gateway passage measured 871/2 feet long and 433/4 feet wide .
26:40:007:1	Rooms for Preparing Sacrifices
26:40:037:0	Its entry room faced into the outer courtyard , and it had palm tree decorations on the columns . There were eight steps leading to its entrance .
26:40:038:0	A door led from the entry room of one of the inner gateways into a side room , where the meat for sacrifices was washed .
26:40:039:0	On each side of this entry room were two tables , where the sacrificial animals were slaughtered for the burnt offerings , sin offerings , and guilt offerings .
26:40:040:0	Outside the entry room , on each side of the stairs going up to the north entrance , were two more tables .
26:40:041:0	So there were eight tables in all — four inside and four outside — where the sacrifices were cut up and prepared .
26:40:042:0	There were also four tables of finished stone for preparation of the burnt offerings , each 311/2 inches square and 21 inches high . On these tables were placed the butchering knives and other implements for slaughtering the sacrificial animals .
26:40:008:1	Rooms for the Priests
26:40:043:0	There were hooks , each 3 inches long , fastened all around the foyer walls . The sacrificial meat was laid on the tables .
26:40:044:0	Inside the inner courtyard were two rooms , one beside the north gateway , facing south , and the other beside the south gateway , facing north .
26:40:045:0	And the man said to me , “ The room beside the north inner gate is for the priests who supervise the Temple maintenance .
26:40:009:1	The Inner Courtyard and Temple
26:40:046:0	The room beside the south inner gate is for the priests in charge of the altar — the descendants of Zadok — for they alone of all the Levites may approach the Lord to minister to him . ”
26:40:047:0	Then the man measured the inner courtyard , and it was a square , 175 feet wide and 175 feet across . The altar stood in the courtyard in front of the Temple .
26:40:048:0	Then he brought me to the entry room of the Temple . He measured the walls on either side of the opening to the entry room , and they were 83/4 feet thick . The entrance itself was 241/2 feet wide , and the walls on each side of the entrance were an additional 51/4 feet long .
26:40:049:0	The entry room was 35 feet wide and 21 feet deep . There were ten steps leading up to it , with a column on each side .
