56:3:001:1	Do What Is Good
56:3:001:0	Remind the believers to submit to the government and its officers . They should be obedient , always ready to do what is good .
56:3:002:0	They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarreling . Instead , they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone .
56:3:003:0	Once we , too , were foolish and disobedient . We were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures . Our lives were full of evil and envy , and we hated each other .
56:3:004:0	But—When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love ,
56:3:005:0	he saved us , not because of the righteous things we had done , but because of his mercy . He washed away our sins , giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit .
56:3:006:0	He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior .
56:3:007:0	Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life .
56:3:008:0	This is a trustworthy saying , and I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good . These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone .
56:3:009:0	Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws . These things are useless and a waste of time .
56:3:010:0	If people are causing divisions among you , give a first and second warning . After that , have nothing more to do with them .
56:3:002:1	Paul 's Final Remarks and Greetings
56:3:011:0	For people like that have turned away from the truth , and their own sins condemn them .
56:3:012:0	I am planning to send either Artemas or Tychicus to you . As soon as one of them arrives , do your best to meet me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to stay there for the winter .
56:3:013:0	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos with their trip . See that they are given everything they need .
56:3:014:0	Our people must learn to do good by meeting the urgent needs of others ; then they will not be unproductive .
56:3:015:0	Everybody here sends greetings . Please give my greetings to the believers—all who love us.May God 's grace be with you all .
