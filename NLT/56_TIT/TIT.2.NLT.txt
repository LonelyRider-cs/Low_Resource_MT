56:2:001:1	Promote Right Teaching
56:2:001:0	As for you , Titus , promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching .
56:2:002:0	Teach the older men to exercise self-control , to be worthy of respect , and to live wisely . They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience .
56:2:003:0	Similarly , teach the older women to live in a way that honors God . They must not slander others or be heavy drinkers . Instead , they should teach others what is good .
56:2:004:0	These older women must train the younger women to love their husbands and their children ,
56:2:005:0	to live wisely and be pure , to work in their homes , to do good , and to be submissive to their husbands . Then they will not bring shame on the word of God .
56:2:006:0	In the same way , encourage the young men to live wisely .
56:2:007:0	And you yourself must be an example to them by doing good works of every kind . Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching .
56:2:008:0	Teach the truth so that your teaching ca n't be criticized . Then those who oppose us will be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us .
56:2:009:0	Slaves must always obey their masters and do their best to please them . They must not talk back
56:2:010:0	or steal , but must show themselves to be entirely trustworthy and good . Then they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive in every way .
56:2:011:0	For the grace of God has been revealed , bringing salvation to all people .
56:2:012:0	And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures . We should live in this evil world with wisdom , righteousness , and devotion to God ,
56:2:013:0	while we look forward with hope to that wonderful day when the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ , will be revealed .
56:2:014:0	He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin , to cleanse us , and to make us his very own people , totally committed to doing good deeds .
56:2:015:0	You must teach these things and encourage the believers to do them . You have the authority to correct them when necessary , so do n't let anyone disregard what you say .
