56:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
56:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I have been sent to proclaim faith to those God has chosen and to teach them to know the truth that shows them how to live godly lives .
56:1:002:0	This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life , which God — who does not lie — promised them before the world began .
56:1:003:0	And now at just the right time he has revealed this message , which we announce to everyone . It is by the command of God our Savior that I have been entrusted with this work for him .
56:1:002:1	Titus 's Work in Crete
56:1:004:0	I am writing to Titus , my true son in the faith that we share.May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace .
56:1:005:0	I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you .
56:1:006:0	An elder must live a blameless life . He must be faithful to his wife , and his children must be believers who do n't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious .
56:1:007:0	A church leader is a manager of God 's household , so he must live a blameless life . He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered ; he must not be a heavy drinker , violent , or dishonest with money .
56:1:008:0	Rather , he must enjoy having guests in his home , and he must love what is good . He must live wisely and be just . He must live a devout and disciplined life .
56:1:009:0	He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught ; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong .
56:1:010:0	For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others . This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation .
56:1:011:0	They must be silenced , because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching . And they do it only for money .
56:1:012:0	Even one of their own men , a prophet from Crete , has said about them , “ The people of Crete are all liars , cruel animals , and lazy gluttons . ”
56:1:013:0	This is true . So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith .
56:1:014:0	They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth .
56:1:015:0	Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure . But nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving , because their minds and consciences are corrupted .
56:1:016:0	Such people claim they know God , but they deny him by the way they live . They are detestable and disobedient , worthless for doing anything good .
