62:5:001:1	Faith in the Son of God
62:5:001:0	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has become a child of God . And everyone who loves the Father loves his children , too .
62:5:002:0	We know we love God 's children if we love God and obey his commandments .
62:5:003:0	Loving God means keeping his commandments , and his commandments are not burdensome .
62:5:004:0	For every child of God defeats this evil world , and we achieve this victory through our faith .
62:5:005:0	And who can win this battle against the world ? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God .
62:5:006:0	And Jesus Christ was revealed as God 's Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross — not by water only , but by water and blood . And the Spirit , who is truth , confirms it with his testimony .
62:5:007:0	So we have these three witnesses —
62:5:008:0	the Spirit , the water , and the blood — and all three agree .
62:5:009:0	Since we believe human testimony , surely we can believe the greater testimony that comes from God . And God has testified about his Son .
62:5:010:0	All who believe in the Son of God know in their hearts that this testimony is true . Those who do n't believe this are actually calling God a liar because they do n't believe what God has testified about his Son .
62:5:011:0	And this is what God has testified : He has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62:5:002:1	Conclusion
62:5:012:0	Whoever has the Son has life ; whoever does not have God 's Son does not have life .
62:5:013:0	I have written this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , so that you may know you have eternal life .
62:5:014:0	And we are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him .
62:5:015:0	And since we know he hears us when we make our requests , we also know that he will give us what we ask for .
62:5:016:0	If you see a fellow believer sinning in a way that does not lead to death , you should pray , and God will give that person life . But there is a sin that leads to death , and I am not saying you should pray for those who commit it .
62:5:017:0	All wicked actions are sin , but not every sin leads to death .
62:5:018:0	We know that God 's children do not make a practice of sinning , for God 's Son holds them securely , and the evil one can not touch them .
62:5:019:0	We know that we are children of God and that the world around us is under the control of the evil one .
62:5:020:0	And we know that the Son of God has come , and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God . And now we live in fellowship with the true God because we live in fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ . He is the only true God , and he is eternal life .
62:5:021:0	Dear children , keep away from anything that might take God 's place in your hearts .
