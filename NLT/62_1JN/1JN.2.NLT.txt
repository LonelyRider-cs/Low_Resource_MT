62:2:001:0	My dear children , I am writing this to you so that you will not sin . But if anyone does sin , we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father . He is Jesus Christ , the one who is truly righteous .
62:2:002:0	He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins — and not only our sins but the sins of all the world .
62:2:003:0	And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments .
62:2:004:0	If someone claims , “ I know God , ” but does n't obey God 's commandments , that person is a liar and is not living in the truth .
62:2:005:0	But those who obey God 's word truly show how completely they love him . That is how we know we are living in him .
62:2:001:1	A New Commandment
62:2:006:0	Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did .
62:2:007:0	Dear friends , I am not writing a new commandment for you ; rather it is an old one you have had from the very beginning . This old commandment — to love one another — is the same message you heard before .
62:2:008:0	Yet it is also new . Jesus lived the truth of this commandment , and you also are living it . For the darkness is disappearing , and the true light is already shining .
62:2:009:0	If anyone claims , “ I am living in the light , ” but hates a fellow believer , that person is still living in darkness .
62:2:010:0	Anyone who loves a fellow believer is living in the light and does not cause others to stumble .
62:2:011:0	But anyone who hates a fellow believer is still living and walking in darkness . Such a person does not know the way to go , having been blinded by the darkness .
62:2:012:0	I am writing to you who are God 's childrenbecause your sins have been forgiven through Jesus .
62:2:013:0	I am writing to you who are mature in the faithbecause you know Christ , who existed from the beginning.I am writing to you who are young in the faithbecause you have won your battle with the evil one .
62:2:002:1	Do Not Love This World
62:2:014:0	I have written to you who are God 's childrenbecause you know the Father.I have written to you who are mature in the faithbecause you know Christ , who existed from the beginning.I have written to you who are young in the faithbecause you are strong.God 's word lives in your hearts , and you have won your battle with the evil one .
62:2:015:0	Do not love this world nor the things it offers you , for when you love the world , you do not have the love of the Father in you .
62:2:016:0	For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure , a craving for everything we see , and pride in our achievements and possessions . These are not from the Father , but are from this world .
62:2:003:1	Warning about Antichrists
62:2:017:0	And this world is fading away , along with everything that people crave . But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever .
62:2:018:0	Dear children , the last hour is here . You have heard that the Antichrist is coming , and already many such antichrists have appeared . From this we know that the last hour has come .
62:2:019:0	These people left our churches , but they never really belonged with us ; otherwise they would have stayed with us . When they left , it proved that they did not belong with us .
62:2:020:0	But you are not like that , for the Holy One has given you his Spirit , and all of you know the truth .
62:2:021:0	So I am writing to you not because you do n't know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies .
62:2:022:0	And who is a liar ? Anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ . Anyone who denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist .
62:2:023:0	Anyone who denies the Son does n't have the Father , either . But anyone who acknowledges the Son has the Father also .
62:2:024:0	So you must remain faithful to what you have been taught from the beginning . If you do , you will remain in fellowship with the Son and with the Father .
62:2:025:0	And in this fellowship we enjoy the eternal life he promised us .
62:2:026:0	I am writing these things to warn you about those who want to lead you astray .
62:2:004:1	Living as Children of God
62:2:027:0	But you have received the Holy Spirit , and he lives within you , so you do n't need anyone to teach you what is true . For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know , and what he teaches is true — it is not a lie . So just as he has taught you , remain in fellowship with Christ .
62:2:028:0	And now , dear children , remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he returns , you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame .
62:2:029:0	Since we know that Christ is righteous , we also know that all who do what is right are God 's children .
