62:1:001:1	Introduction
62:1:001:0	We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning , whom we have heard and seen . We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands . He is the Word of life .
62:1:002:0	This one who is life itself was revealed to us , and we have seen him . And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life . He was with the Father , and then he was revealed to us .
62:1:003:0	We proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may have fellowship with us . And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62:1:002:1	Living in the Light
62:1:004:0	We are writing these things so that you may fully share our joy .
62:1:005:0	This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you : God is light , and there is no darkness in him at all .
62:1:006:0	So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness ; we are not practicing the truth .
62:1:007:0	But if we are living in the light , as God is in the light , then we have fellowship with each other , and the blood of Jesus , his Son , cleanses us from all sin .
62:1:008:0	If we claim we have no sin , we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth .
62:1:009:0	But if we confess our sins to him , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness .
62:1:010:0	If we claim we have not sinned , we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts .
