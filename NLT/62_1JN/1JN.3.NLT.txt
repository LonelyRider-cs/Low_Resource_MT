62:3:001:0	See how very much our Father loves us , for he calls us his children , and that is what we are ! But the people who belong to this world do n't recognize that we are God 's children because they do n't know him .
62:3:002:0	Dear friends , we are already God 's children , but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears . But we do know that we will be like him , for we will see him as he really is .
62:3:003:0	And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure , just as he is pure .
62:3:004:0	Everyone who sins is breaking God 's law , for all sin is contrary to the law of God .
62:3:005:0	And you know that Jesus came to take away our sins , and there is no sin in him .
62:3:006:0	Anyone who continues to live in him will not sin . But anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him or understand who he is .
62:3:007:0	Dear children , do n't let anyone deceive you about this : When people do what is right , it shows that they are righteous , even as Christ is righteous .
62:3:008:0	But when people keep on sinning , it shows that they belong to the devil , who has been sinning since the beginning . But the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil .
62:3:009:0	Those who have been born into God 's family do not make a practice of sinning , because God 's life is in them . So they ca n't keep on sinning , because they are children of God .
62:3:001:1	Love One Another
62:3:010:0	So now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the devil . Anyone who does not live righteously and does not love other believers does not belong to God .
62:3:011:0	This is the message you have heard from the beginning : We should love one another .
62:3:012:0	We must not be like Cain , who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother . And why did he kill him ? Because Cain had been doing what was evil , and his brother had been doing what was righteous .
62:3:013:0	So do n't be surprised , dear brothers and sisters , if the world hates you .
62:3:014:0	If we love our brothers and sisters who are believers , it proves that we have passed from death to life . But a person who has no love is still dead .
62:3:015:0	Anyone who hates another brother or sister is really a murderer at heart . And you know that murderers do n't have eternal life within them .
62:3:016:0	We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us . So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters .
62:3:017:0	If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows no compassion â€” how can God 's love be in that person ?
62:3:018:0	Dear children , let 's not merely say that we love each other ; let us show the truth by our actions .
62:3:019:0	Our actions will show that we belong to the truth , so we will be confident when we stand before God .
62:3:020:0	Even if we feel guilty , God is greater than our feelings , and he knows everything .
62:3:021:0	Dear friends , if we do n't feel guilty , we can come to God with bold confidence .
62:3:022:0	And we will receive from him whatever we ask because we obey him and do the things that please him .
62:3:023:0	And this is his commandment : We must believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another , just as he commanded us .
62:3:024:0	Those who obey God 's commandments remain in fellowship with him , and he with them . And we know he lives in us because the Spirit he gave us lives in us .
