66:22:001:0	Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life , clear as crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
66:22:002:0	It flowed down the center of the main street . On each side of the river grew a tree of life , bearing twelve crops of fruit , with a fresh crop each month . The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations .
66:22:003:0	No longer will there be a curse upon anything . For the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there , and his servants will worship him .
66:22:004:0	And they will see his face , and his name will be written on their foreheads .
66:22:005:0	And there will be no night there — no need for lamps or sun — for the Lord God will shine on them . And they will reign forever and ever .
66:22:001:1	Jesus Is Coming
66:22:006:0	Then the angel said to me , “ Everything you have heard and seen is trustworthy and true . The Lord God , who inspires his prophets , has sent his angel to tell his servants what will happen soon . ”
66:22:007:0	“ Look , I am coming soon ! Blessed are those who obey the words of prophecy written in this book . ”
66:22:008:0	I , John , am the one who heard and saw all these things . And when I heard and saw them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me .
66:22:009:0	But he said , “ No , do n't worship me . I am a servant of God , just like you and your brothers the prophets , as well as all who obey what is written in this book . Worship only God ! ”
66:22:010:0	Then he instructed me , “ Do not seal up the prophetic words in this book , for the time is near .
66:22:011:0	Let the one who is doing harm continue to do harm ; let the one who is vile continue to be vile ; let the one who is righteous continue to live righteously ; let the one who is holy continue to be holy . ”
66:22:012:0	“ Look , I am coming soon , bringing my reward with me to repay all people according to their deeds .
66:22:013:0	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End . ”
66:22:014:0	Blessed are those who wash their robes . They will be permitted to enter through the gates of the city and eat the fruit from the tree of life .
66:22:015:0	Outside the city are the dogs — the sorcerers , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idol worshipers , and all who love to live a lie .
66:22:016:0	“ I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches . I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne . I am the bright morning star . ”
66:22:017:0	The Spirit and the bride say , “ Come. ” Let anyone who hears this say , “ Come. ” Let anyone who is thirsty come . Let anyone who desires drink freely from the water of life .
66:22:018:0	And I solemnly declare to everyone who hears the words of prophecy written in this book : If anyone adds anything to what is written here , God will add to that person the plagues described in this book .
66:22:019:0	And if anyone removes any of the words from this book of prophecy , God will remove that person 's share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book .
66:22:020:0	He who is the faithful witness to all these things says , “ Yes , I am coming soon ! ” Amen ! Come , Lord Jesus !
66:22:021:0	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with God 's holy people .
