66:10:001:1	The Angel and the Small Scroll
66:10:001:0	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven , surrounded by a cloud , with a rainbow over his head . His face shone like the sun , and his feet were like pillars of fire .
66:10:002:0	And in his hand was a small scroll that had been opened . He stood with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
66:10:003:0	And he gave a great shout like the roar of a lion . And when he shouted , the seven thunders answered .
66:10:004:0	When the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write . But I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Keep secret what the seven thunders said , and do not write it down . ”
66:10:005:0	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven .
66:10:006:0	He swore an oath in the name of the one who lives forever and ever , who created the heavens and everything in them , the earth and everything in it , and the sea and everything in it . He said , “ There will be no more delay .
66:10:007:0	When the seventh angel blows his trumpet , God 's mysterious plan will be fulfilled . It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets . ”
66:10:008:0	Then the voice from heaven spoke to me again : “ Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . ”
66:10:009:0	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll . “ Yes , take it and eat it , ” he said . “ It will be sweet as honey in your mouth , but it will turn sour in your stomach ! ”
66:10:010:0	So I took the small scroll from the hand of the angel , and I ate it ! It was sweet in my mouth , but when I swallowed it , it turned sour in my stomach .
66:10:011:0	Then I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
