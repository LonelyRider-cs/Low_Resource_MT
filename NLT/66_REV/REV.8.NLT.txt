66:8:001:1	The Lamb Breaks the Seventh Seal
66:8:001:0	When the Lamb broke the seventh seal on the scroll , there was silence throughout heaven for about half an hour .
66:8:002:0	I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and they were given seven trumpets .
66:8:003:0	Then another angel with a gold incense burner came and stood at the altar . And a great amount of incense was given to him to mix with the prayers of God 's people as an offering on the gold altar before the throne .
66:8:004:0	The smoke of the incense , mixed with the prayers of God 's holy people , ascended up to God from the altar where the angel had poured them out .
66:8:002:1	The First Four Trumpets
66:8:005:0	Then the angel filled the incense burner with fire from the altar and threw it down upon the earth ; and thunder crashed , lightning flashed , and there was a terrible earthquake .
66:8:006:0	Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their mighty blasts .
66:8:007:0	The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth . One-third of the earth was set on fire , one-third of the trees were burned , and all the green grass was burned .
66:8:008:0	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and a great mountain of fire was thrown into the sea . One-third of the water in the sea became blood ,
66:8:009:0	one-third of all things living in the sea died , and one-third of all the ships on the sea were destroyed .
66:8:010:0	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch . It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66:8:011:0	The name of the star was Bitterness . It made one-third of the water bitter , and many people died from drinking the bitter water .
66:8:012:0	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and one-third of the sun was struck , and one-third of the moon , and one-third of the stars , and they became dark . And one-third of the day was dark , and also one-third of the night .
66:8:013:0	Then I looked , and I heard a single eagle crying loudly as it flew through the air , “ Terror , terror , terror to all who belong to this world because of what will happen when the last three angels blow their trumpets . ”
