66:6:001:1	The Lamb Breaks the First Six Seals
66:6:001:0	As I watched , the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals on the scroll . Then I heard one of the four living beings say with a voice like thunder , “ Come ! ”
66:6:002:0	I looked up and saw a white horse standing there . Its rider carried a bow , and a crown was placed on his head . He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory .
66:6:003:0	When the Lamb broke the second seal , I heard the second living being say , “ Come ! ”
66:6:004:0	Then another horse appeared , a red one . Its rider was given a mighty sword and the authority to take peace from the earth . And there was war and slaughter everywhere .
66:6:005:0	When the Lamb broke the third seal , I heard the third living being say , “ Come ! ” I looked up and saw a black horse , and its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand .
66:6:006:0	And I heard a voice from among the four living beings say , “ A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day 's pay . And do n't waste the olive oil and wine . ”
66:6:007:0	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal , I heard the fourth living being say , “ Come ! ”
66:6:008:0	I looked up and saw a horse whose color was pale green . Its rider was named Death , and his companion was the Grave . These two were given authority over one-fourth of the earth , to kill with the sword and famine and disease and wild animals .
66:6:009:0	When the Lamb broke the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of all who had been martyred for the word of God and for being faithful in their testimony .
66:6:010:0	They shouted to the Lord and said , “ O Sovereign Lord , holy and true , how long before you judge the people who belong to this world and avenge our blood for what they have done to us ? ”
66:6:011:0	Then a white robe was given to each of them . And they were told to rest a little longer until the full number of their brothers and sisters — their fellow servants of Jesus who were to be martyred — had joined them .
66:6:012:0	I watched as the Lamb broke the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became as dark as black cloth , and the moon became as red as blood .
66:6:013:0	Then the stars of the sky fell to the earth like green figs falling from a tree shaken by a strong wind .
66:6:014:0	The sky was rolled up like a scroll , and all of the mountains and islands were moved from their places .
66:6:015:0	Then everyone — the kings of the earth , the rulers , the generals , the wealthy , the powerful , and every slave and free person — all hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
66:6:016:0	And they cried to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb .
66:6:017:0	For the great day of their wrath has come , and who is able to survive ? ”
