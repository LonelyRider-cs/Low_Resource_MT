66:18:001:1	The Fall of Babylon
66:18:001:0	After all this I saw another angel come down from heaven with great authority , and the earth grew bright with his splendor .
66:18:002:0	He gave a mighty shout : “ Babylon is fallen—that great city is fallen ! She has become a home for demons.She is a hideout for every foul spirit , a hideout for every foul vultureand every foul and dreadful animal .
66:18:003:0	For all the nations have fallenbecause of the wine of her passionate immorality.The kings of the worldhave committed adultery with her.Because of her desires for extravagant luxury , the merchants of the world have grown rich . ”
66:18:004:0	Then I heard another voice calling from heaven , “ Come away from her , my people.Do not take part in her sins , or you will be punished with her .
66:18:005:0	For her sins are piled as high as heaven , and God remembers her evil deeds .
66:18:006:0	Do to her as she has done to others.Double her penalty for all her evil deeds.She brewed a cup of terror for others , so brew twice as much for her .
66:18:007:0	She glorified herself and lived in luxury , so match it now with torment and sorrow.She boasted in her heart , ‘ I am queen on my throne.I am no helpless widow , and I have no reason to mourn . '
66:18:008:0	Therefore , these plagues will overtake her in a single day—death and mourning and famine.She will be completely consumed by fire , for the Lord God who judges her is mighty . ”
66:18:009:0	And the kings of the world who committed adultery with her and enjoyed her great luxury will mourn for her as they see the smoke rising from her charred remains .
66:18:010:0	They will stand at a distance , terrified by her great torment . They will cry out , “ How terrible , how terrible for you , O Babylon , you great city ! In a single momentGod 's judgment came on you . ”
66:18:011:0	The merchants of the world will weep and mourn for her , for there is no one left to buy their goods .
66:18:012:0	She bought great quantities of gold , silver , jewels , and pearls ; fine linen , purple , silk , and scarlet cloth ; things made of fragrant thyine wood , ivory goods , and objects made of expensive wood ; and bronze , iron , and marble .
66:18:013:0	She also bought cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , wagons , and bodies—that is , human slaves .
66:18:014:0	“ The fancy things you loved so muchare gone , ” they cry. “ All your luxuries and splendorare gone forever , never to be yours again . ”
66:18:015:0	The merchants who became wealthy by selling her these things will stand at a distance , terrified by her great torment . They will weep and cry out ,
66:18:016:0	“ How terrible , how terrible for that great city ! She was clothed in finest purple and scarlet linens , decked out with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66:18:017:0	In a single momentall the wealth of the city is gone ! ” And all the captains of the merchant ships and their passengers and sailors and crews will stand at a distance .
66:18:018:0	They will cry out as they watch the smoke ascend , and they will say , “ Where is there another city as great as this ? ”
66:18:019:0	And they will weep and throw dust on their heads to show their grief . And they will cry out , “ How terrible , how terrible for that great city ! The shipowners became wealthyby transporting her great wealth on the seas.In a single moment it is all gone . ”
66:18:020:0	Rejoice over her fate , O heavenand people of God and apostles and prophets ! For at last God has judged herfor your sakes .
66:18:021:0	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a huge millstone . He threw it into the ocean and shouted , “ Just like this , the great city Babylonwill be thrown down with violenceand will never be found again .
66:18:022:0	The sound of harps , singers , flutes , and trumpetswill never be heard in you again.No craftsmen and no tradeswill ever be found in you again.The sound of the millwill never be heard in you again .
66:18:023:0	The light of a lampwill never shine in you again.The happy voices of brides and groomswill never be heard in you again.For your merchants were the greatest in the world , and you deceived the nations with your sorceries .
66:18:024:0	In your streets flowed the blood of the prophets and of God 's holy peopleand the blood of people slaughtered all over the world . ”
