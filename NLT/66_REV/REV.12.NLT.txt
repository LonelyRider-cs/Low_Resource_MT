66:12:001:1	The Woman and the Dragon
66:12:001:0	Then I witnessed in heaven an event of great significance . I saw a woman clothed with the sun , with the moon beneath her feet , and a crown of twelve stars on her head .
66:12:002:0	She was pregnant , and she cried out because of her labor pains and the agony of giving birth .
66:12:003:0	Then I witnessed in heaven another significant event . I saw a large red dragon with seven heads and ten horns , with seven crowns on his heads .
66:12:004:0	His tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky , and he threw them to the earth . He stood in front of the woman as she was about to give birth , ready to devour her baby as soon as it was born .
66:12:005:0	She gave birth to a son who was to rule all nations with an iron rod . And her child was snatched away from the dragon and was caught up to God and to his throne .
66:12:006:0	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where God had prepared a place to care for her for 1,260 days .
66:12:007:0	Then there was war in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels .
66:12:008:0	And the dragon lost the battle , and he and his angels were forced out of heaven .
66:12:009:0	This great dragon — the ancient serpent called the devil , or Satan , the one deceiving the whole world — was thrown down to the earth with all his angels .
66:12:010:0	Then I heard a loud voice shouting across the heavens , “ It has come at last — salvation and powerand the Kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ.For the accuser of our brothers and sistershas been thrown down to earth — the one who accuses thembefore our God day and night .
66:12:011:0	And they have defeated him by the blood of the Lamband by their testimony.And they did not love their lives so muchthat they were afraid to die .
66:12:012:0	Therefore , rejoice , O heavens ! And you who live in the heavens , rejoice ! But terror will come on the earth and the sea , for the devil has come down to you in great anger , knowing that he has little time . ”
66:12:013:0	When the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth , he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child .
66:12:014:0	But she was given two wings like those of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness . There she would be cared for and protected from the dragon for a time , times , and half a time .
66:12:015:0	Then the dragon tried to drown the woman with a flood of water that flowed from his mouth .
66:12:016:0	But the earth helped her by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that gushed out from the mouth of the dragon .
66:12:017:0	And the dragon was angry at the woman and declared war against the rest of her children — all who keep God 's commandments and maintain their testimony for Jesus .
66:12:018:0	Then the dragon took his stand on the shore beside the sea .
