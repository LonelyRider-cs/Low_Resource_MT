66:15:001:1	The Song of Moses and of the Lamb
66:15:001:0	Then I saw in heaven another marvelous event of great significance . Seven angels were holding the seven last plagues , which would bring God 's wrath to completion .
66:15:002:0	I saw before me what seemed to be a glass sea mixed with fire . And on it stood all the people who had been victorious over the beast and his statue and the number representing his name . They were all holding harps that God had given them .
66:15:003:0	And they were singing the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ Great and marvelous are your works , O Lord God , the Almighty.Just and true are your ways , O King of the nations .
66:15:002:1	The Seven Bowls of the Seven Plagues
66:15:004:0	Who will not fear you , Lord , and glorify your name ? For you alone are holy.All nations will come and worship before you , for your righteous deeds have been revealed . ”
66:15:005:0	Then I looked and saw that the Temple in heaven , God 's Tabernacle , was thrown wide open .
66:15:006:0	The seven angels who were holding the seven plagues came out of the Temple . They were clothed in spotless white linen with gold sashes across their chests .
66:15:007:0	Then one of the four living beings handed each of the seven angels a gold bowl filled with the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
66:15:008:0	The Temple was filled with smoke from God 's glory and power . No one could enter the Temple until the seven angels had completed pouring out the seven plagues .
