66:7:001:1	God 's People Will Be Preserved
66:7:001:0	Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds so they did not blow on the earth or the sea , or even on any tree .
66:7:002:0	And I saw another angel coming up from the east , carrying the seal of the living God . And he shouted to those four angels , who had been given power to harm land and sea ,
66:7:003:0	“ Wait ! Do n't harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have placed the seal of God on the foreheads of his servants . ”
66:7:004:0	And I heard how many were marked with the seal of God — 144,000 were sealed from all the tribes of Israel :
66:7:005:0	from Judah12,000from Reuben12,000from Gad12,000
66:7:006:0	from Asher12,000from Naphtali12,000from Manasseh12,000
66:7:007:0	from Simeon12,000from Levi12,000from Issachar12,000
66:7:002:1	Praise from the Great Crowd
66:7:008:0	from Zebulun12,000from Joseph12,000from Benjamin12,000
66:7:009:0	After this I saw a vast crowd , too great to count , from every nation and tribe and people and language , standing in front of the throne and before the Lamb . They were clothed in white robes and held palm branches in their hands .
66:7:010:0	And they were shouting with a great roar , “ Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throneand from the Lamb ! ”
66:7:011:0	And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living beings . And they fell before the throne with their faces to the ground and worshiped God .
66:7:012:0	They sang , “ Amen ! Blessing and glory and wisdomand thanksgiving and honorand power and strength belong to our Godforever and ever ! Amen . ”
66:7:013:0	Then one of the twenty-four elders asked me , “ Who are these who are clothed in white ? Where did they come from ? ”
66:7:014:0	And I said to him , “ Sir , you are the one who knows. ” Then he said to me , “ These are the ones who died in the great tribulation . They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white .
66:7:015:0	“ That is why they stand in front of God 's throneand serve him day and night in his Temple.And he who sits on the thronewill give them shelter .
66:7:016:0	They will never again be hungry or thirsty ; they will never be scorched by the heat of the sun .
66:7:017:0	For the Lamb on the thronewill be their Shepherd.He will lead them to springs of life-giving water.And God will wipe every tear from their eyes . ”
