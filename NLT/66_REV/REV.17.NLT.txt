66:17:001:1	The Great Prostitute
66:17:001:0	One of the seven angels who had poured out the seven bowls came over and spoke to me . “ Come with me , ” he said , “ and I will show you the judgment that is going to come on the great prostitute , who rules over many waters .
66:17:002:0	The kings of the world have committed adultery with her , and the people who belong to this world have been made drunk by the wine of her immorality . ”
66:17:003:0	So the angel took me in the Spirit into the wilderness . There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that had seven heads and ten horns , and blasphemies against God were written all over it .
66:17:004:0	The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing and beautiful jewelry made of gold and precious gems and pearls . In her hand she held a gold goblet full of obscenities and the impurities of her immorality .
66:17:005:0	A mysterious name was written on her forehead : “ Babylon the Great , Mother of All Prostitutes and Obscenities in the World . ”
66:17:006:0	I could see that she was drunk — drunk with the blood of God 's holy people who were witnesses for Jesus . I stared at her in complete amazement .
66:17:007:0	“ Why are you so amazed ? ” the angel asked . “ I will tell you the mystery of this woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns on which she sits .
66:17:008:0	The beast you saw was once alive but is n't now . And yet he will soon come up out of the bottomless pit and go to eternal destruction . And the people who belong to this world , whose names were not written in the Book of Life before the world was made , will be amazed at the reappearance of this beast who had died .
66:17:009:0	“ This calls for a mind with understanding : The seven heads of the beast represent the seven hills where the woman rules . They also represent seven kings .
66:17:010:0	Five kings have already fallen , the sixth now reigns , and the seventh is yet to come , but his reign will be brief .
66:17:011:0	“ The scarlet beast that was , but is no longer , is the eighth king . He is like the other seven , and he , too , is headed for destruction .
66:17:012:0	The ten horns of the beast are ten kings who have not yet risen to power . They will be appointed to their kingdoms for one brief moment to reign with the beast .
66:17:013:0	They will all agree to give him their power and authority .
66:17:014:0	Together they will go to war against the Lamb , but the Lamb will defeat them because he is Lord of all lords and King of all kings . And his called and chosen and faithful ones will be with him . ”
66:17:015:0	Then the angel said to me , “ The waters where the prostitute is ruling represent masses of people of every nation and language .
66:17:016:0	The scarlet beast and his ten horns all hate the prostitute . They will strip her naked , eat her flesh , and burn her remains with fire .
66:17:017:0	For God has put a plan into their minds , a plan that will carry out his purposes . They will agree to give their authority to the scarlet beast , and so the words of God will be fulfilled .
66:17:018:0	And this woman you saw in your vision represents the great city that rules over the kings of the world . ”
