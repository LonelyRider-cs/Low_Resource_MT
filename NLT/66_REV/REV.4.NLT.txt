66:4:001:1	Worship in Heaven
66:4:001:0	Then as I looked , I saw a door standing open in heaven , and the same voice I had heard before spoke to me like a trumpet blast . The voice said , “ Come up here , and I will show you what must happen after this . ”
66:4:002:0	And instantly I was in the Spirit , and I saw a throne in heaven and someone sitting on it .
66:4:003:0	The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones — like jasper and carnelian . And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow .
66:4:004:0	Twenty-four thrones surrounded him , and twenty-four elders sat on them . They were all clothed in white and had gold crowns on their heads .
66:4:005:0	From the throne came flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder . And in front of the throne were seven torches with burning flames . This is the sevenfold Spirit of God .
66:4:006:0	In front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass , sparkling like crystal.In the center and around the throne were four living beings , each covered with eyes , front and back .
66:4:007:0	The first of these living beings was like a lion ; the second was like an ox ; the third had a human face ; and the fourth was like an eagle in flight .
66:4:008:0	Each of these living beings had six wings , and their wings were covered all over with eyes , inside and out . Day after day and night after night they keep on saying , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God , the Almighty — the one who always was , who is , and who is still to come . ”
66:4:009:0	Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne ( the one who lives forever and ever ) ,
66:4:010:0	the twenty-four elders fall down and worship the one sitting on the throne ( the one who lives forever and ever ) . And they lay their crowns before the throne and say ,
66:4:011:0	“ You are worthy , O Lord our God , to receive glory and honor and power.For you created all things , and they exist because you created what you pleased . ”
