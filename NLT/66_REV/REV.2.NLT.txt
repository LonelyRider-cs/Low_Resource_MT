66:2:001:1	The Message to the Church in Ephesus
66:2:001:0	“ Write this letter to the angel of the church in Ephesus . This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand , the one who walks among the seven gold lampstands :
66:2:002:0	“ I know all the things you do . I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance . I know you do n't tolerate evil people . You have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not . You have discovered they are liars .
66:2:003:0	You have patiently suffered for me without quitting .
66:2:004:0	“ But I have this complaint against you . You do n't love me or each other as you did at first !
66:2:005:0	Look how far you have fallen ! Turn back to me and do the works you did at first . If you do n't repent , I will come and remove your lampstand from its place among the churches .
66:2:006:0	But this is in your favor : You hate the evil deeds of the Nicolaitans , just as I do .
66:2:002:1	The Message to the Church in Smyrna
66:2:007:0	“ Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches . To everyone who is victorious I will give fruit from the tree of life in the paradise of God .
66:2:008:0	“ Write this letter to the angel of the church in Smyrna . This is the message from the one who is the First and the Last , who was dead but is now alive :
66:2:009:0	“ I know about your suffering and your poverty—but you are rich ! I know the blasphemy of those opposing you . They say they are Jews , but they are not , because their synagogue belongs to Satan .
66:2:010:0	Do n't be afraid of what you are about to suffer . The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you . You will suffer for ten days . But if you remain faithful even when facing death , I will give you the crown of life .
66:2:003:1	The Message to the Church in Pergamum
66:2:011:0	“ Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches . Whoever is victorious will not be harmed by the second death .
66:2:012:0	“ Write this letter to the angel of the church in Pergamum . This is the message from the one with the sharp two-edged sword :
66:2:013:0	“ I know that you live in the city where Satan has his throne , yet you have remained loyal to me . You refused to deny me even when Antipas , my faithful witness , was martyred among you there in Satan 's city .
66:2:014:0	“ But I have a few complaints against you . You tolerate some among you whose teaching is like that of Balaam , who showed Balak how to trip up the people of Israel . He taught them to sin by eating food offered to idols and by committing sexual sin .
66:2:015:0	In a similar way , you have some Nicolaitans among you who follow the same teaching .
66:2:016:0	Repent of your sin , or I will come to you suddenly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
66:2:004:1	The Message to the Church in Thyatira
66:2:017:0	“ Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches . To everyone who is victorious I will give some of the manna that has been hidden away in heaven . And I will give to each one a white stone , and on the stone will be engraved a new name that no one understands except the one who receives it .
66:2:018:0	“ Write this letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira . This is the message from the Son of God , whose eyes are like flames of fire , whose feet are like polished bronze :
66:2:019:0	“ I know all the things you do . I have seen your love , your faith , your service , and your patient endurance . And I can see your constant improvement in all these things .
66:2:020:0	“ But I have this complaint against you . You are permitting that woman—that Jezebel who calls herself a prophet—to lead my servants astray . She teaches them to commit sexual sin and to eat food offered to idols .
66:2:021:0	I gave her time to repent , but she does not want to turn away from her immorality .
66:2:022:0	“ Therefore , I will throw her on a bed of suffering , and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds .
66:2:023:0	I will strike her children dead . Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches out the thoughts and intentions of every person . And I will give to each of you whatever you deserve .
66:2:024:0	“ But I also have a message for the rest of you in Thyatira who have not followed this false teaching ( ‘ deeper truths , ' as they call them—depths of Satan , actually ) . I will ask nothing more of you
66:2:025:0	except that you hold tightly to what you have until I come .
66:2:026:0	To all who are victorious , who obey me to the very end , To them I will give authority over all the nations .
66:2:027:0	They will rule the nations with an iron rodand smash them like clay pots .
66:2:028:0	They will have the same authority I received from my Father , and I will also give them the morning star !
66:2:029:0	“ Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches .
