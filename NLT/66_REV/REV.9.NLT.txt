66:9:001:1	The Fifth Trumpet Brings the First Terror
66:9:001:0	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky , and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit .
66:9:002:0	When he opened it , smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace , and the sunlight and air turned dark from the smoke .
66:9:003:0	Then locusts came from the smoke and descended on the earth , and they were given power to sting like scorpions .
66:9:004:0	They were told not to harm the grass or plants or trees , but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
66:9:005:0	They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting .
66:9:006:0	In those days people will seek death but will not find it . They will long to die , but death will flee from them !
66:9:007:0	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . They had what looked like gold crowns on their heads , and their faces looked like human faces .
66:9:008:0	They had hair like women 's hair and teeth like the teeth of a lion .
66:9:009:0	They wore armor made of iron , and their wings roared like an army of chariots rushing into battle .
66:9:010:0	They had tails that stung like scorpions , and for five months they had the power to torment people .
66:9:011:0	Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit ; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in Greek , Apollyon—the Destroyer .
66:9:002:1	The Sixth Trumpet Brings the Second Terror
66:9:012:0	The first terror is past , but look , two more terrors are coming !
66:9:013:0	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice speaking from the four horns of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God .
66:9:014:0	And the voice said to the sixth angel who held the trumpet , “ Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates River . ”
66:9:015:0	Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were turned loose to kill one-third of all the people on earth .
66:9:016:0	I heard the size of their army , which was 200 million mounted troops .
66:9:017:0	And in my vision , I saw the horses and the riders sitting on them . The riders wore armor that was fiery red and dark blue and yellow . The horses had heads like lions , and fire and smoke and burning sulfur billowed from their mouths .
66:9:018:0	One-third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues—by the fire and smoke and burning sulfur that came from the mouths of the horses .
66:9:019:0	Their power was in their mouths and in their tails . For their tails had heads like snakes , with the power to injure people .
66:9:020:0	But the people who did not die in these plagues still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God . They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood—idols that can neither see nor hear nor walk !
66:9:021:0	And they did not repent of their murders or their witchcraft or their sexual immorality or their thefts .
