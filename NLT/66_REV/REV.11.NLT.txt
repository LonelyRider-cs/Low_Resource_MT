66:11:001:1	The Two Witnesses
66:11:001:0	Then I was given a measuring stick , and I was told , “ Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar , and count the number of worshipers .
66:11:002:0	But do not measure the outer courtyard , for it has been turned over to the nations . They will trample the holy city for 42 months .
66:11:003:0	And I will give power to my two witnesses , and they will be clothed in burlap and will prophesy during those 1,260 days . ”
66:11:004:0	These two prophets are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of all the earth .
66:11:005:0	If anyone tries to harm them , fire flashes from their mouths and consumes their enemies . This is how anyone who tries to harm them must die .
66:11:006:0	They have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy . And they have the power to turn the rivers and oceans into blood , and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish .
66:11:007:0	When they complete their testimony , the beast that comes up out of the bottomless pit will declare war against them , and he will conquer them and kill them .
66:11:008:0	And their bodies will lie in the main street of Jerusalem , the city that is figuratively called “ Sodom ” and “ Egypt , ” the city where their Lord was crucified .
66:11:009:0	And for three and a half days , all peoples , tribes , languages , and nations will stare at their bodies . No one will be allowed to bury them .
66:11:010:0	All the people who belong to this world will gloat over them and give presents to each other to celebrate the death of the two prophets who had tormented them .
66:11:011:0	But after three and a half days , God breathed life into them , and they stood up ! Terror struck all who were staring at them .
66:11:012:0	Then a loud voice from heaven called to the two prophets , “ Come up here ! ” And they rose to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched .
66:11:013:0	At the same time there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city . Seven thousand people died in that earthquake , and everyone else was terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66:11:002:1	The Seventh Trumpet Brings the Third Terror
66:11:014:0	The second terror is past , but look , the third terror is coming quickly .
66:11:015:0	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet , and there were loud voices shouting in heaven : “ The world has now become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ , and he will reign forever and ever . ”
66:11:016:0	The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones before God fell with their faces to the ground and worshiped him .
66:11:017:0	And they said , “ We give thanks to you , Lord God , the Almighty , the one who is and who always was , for now you have assumed your great powerand have begun to reign .
66:11:018:0	The nations were filled with wrath , but now the time of your wrath has come.It is time to judge the deadand reward your servants the prophets , as well as your holy people , and all who fear your name , from the least to the greatest.It is time to destroyall who have caused destruction on the earth . ”
66:11:019:0	Then , in heaven , the Temple of God was opened and the Ark of his covenant could be seen inside the Temple . Lightning flashed , thunder crashed and roared , and there was an earthquake and a terrible hailstorm .
