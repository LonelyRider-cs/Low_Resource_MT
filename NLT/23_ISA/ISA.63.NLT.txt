23:63:001:1	Judgment against the
23:63:002:1	Lord
23:63:003:1	's Enemies
23:63:001:0	Who is this who comes from Edom , from the city of Bozrah , with his clothing stained red ? Who is this in royal robes , marching in his great strength ? “ It is I , the Lord , announcing your salvation ! It is I , the Lord , who has the power to save ! ”
23:63:002:0	Why are your clothes so red , as if you have been treading out grapes ?
23:63:003:0	“ I have been treading the winepress alone ; no one was there to help me.In my anger I have trampled my enemiesas if they were grapes.In my fury I have trampled my foes.Their blood has stained my clothes .
23:63:004:0	For the time has come for me to avenge my people , to ransom them from their oppressors .
23:63:005:0	I was amazed to see that no one intervenedto help the oppressed.So I myself stepped in to save them with my strong arm , and my wrath sustained me .
23:63:004:1	Praise for Deliverance
23:63:006:0	I crushed the nations in my angerand made them stagger and fall to the ground , spilling their blood upon the earth . ”
23:63:007:0	I will tell of the Lord 's unfailing love.I will praise the Lord for all he has done.I will rejoice in his great goodness to Israel , which he has granted according to his mercy and love .
23:63:008:0	He said , “ They are my very own people.Surely they will not betray me again. ” And he became their Savior .
23:63:009:0	In all their suffering he also suffered , and he personally rescued them.In his love and mercy he redeemed them.He lifted them up and carried themthrough all the years .
23:63:010:0	But they rebelled against himand grieved his Holy Spirit.So he became their enemyand fought against them .
23:63:011:0	Then they remembered those days of oldwhen Moses led his people out of Egypt.They cried out , “ Where is the one who brought Israel through the sea , with Moses as their shepherd ? Where is the one who sent his Holy Spiritto be among his people ?
23:63:012:0	Where is the one whose power was displayedwhen Moses lifted up his hand — the one who divided the sea before them , making himself famous forever ?
23:63:013:0	Where is the one who led them through the bottom of the sea ? They were like fine stallionsracing through the desert , never stumbling .
23:63:005:1	Prayer for Mercy and Pardon
23:63:014:0	As with cattle going down into a peaceful valley , the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest.You led your people , Lord , and gained a magnificent reputation . ”
23:63:015:0	Lord , look down from heaven ; look from your holy , glorious home , and see us.Where is the passion and the mightyou used to show on our behalf ? Where are your mercy and compassion now ?
23:63:016:0	Surely you are still our Father ! Even if Abraham and Jacob would disown us , Lord , you would still be our Father.You are our Redeemer from ages past .
23:63:017:0	Lord , why have you allowed us to turn from your path ? Why have you given us stubborn hearts so we no longer fear you ? Return and help us , for we are your servants , the tribes that are your special possession .
23:63:018:0	How briefly your holy people possessed your holy place , and now our enemies have destroyed it .
23:63:019:0	Sometimes it seems as though we never belonged to you , as though we had never been known as your people .
