23:65:001:1	Judgment and Final Salvation
23:65:001:0	The Lord says , “ I was ready to respond , but no one asked for help.I was ready to be found , but no one was looking for me.I said , ‘ Here I am , here I am ! 'to a nation that did not call on my name .
23:65:002:0	All day long I opened my arms to a rebellious people.But they follow their own evil pathsand their own crooked schemes .
23:65:003:0	All day long they insult me to my faceby worshiping idols in their sacred gardens.They burn incense on pagan altars .
23:65:004:0	At night they go out among the graves , worshiping the dead.They eat the flesh of pigsand make stews with other forbidden foods .
23:65:005:0	Yet they say to each other , ‘ Do n't come too close or you will defile me ! I am holier than you ! 'These people are a stench in my nostrils , an acrid smell that never goes away .
23:65:006:0	“ Look , my decree is written out in front of me : I will not stand silent ; I will repay them in full ! Yes , I will repay them —
23:65:007:0	both for their own sinsand for those of their ancestors , ” says the Lord. “ For they also burned incense on the mountainsand insulted me on the hills.I will pay them back in full !
23:65:008:0	“ But I will not destroy them all , ” says the Lord. “ For just as good grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones ( and someone will say , ‘ Do n't throw them all away — some of those grapes are good ! ' ) , so I will not destroy all Israel.For I still have true servants there .
23:65:009:0	I will preserve a remnant of the people of Israeland of Judah to possess my land.Those I choose will inherit it , and my servants will live there .
23:65:010:0	The plain of Sharon will again be filled with flocksfor my people who have searched for me , and the valley of Achor will be a place to pasture herds .
23:65:011:0	“ But because the rest of you have forsaken the Lordand have forgotten his Temple , and because you have prepared feasts to honor the god of Fateand have offered mixed wine to the god of Destiny ,
23:65:012:0	now I will ‘ destine ' you for the sword.All of you will bow down before the executioner.For when I called , you did not answer.When I spoke , you did not listen.You deliberately sinned — before my very eyes — and chose to do what you know I despise . ”
23:65:013:0	Therefore , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ My servants will eat , but you will starve.My servants will drink , but you will be thirsty.My servants will rejoice , but you will be sad and ashamed .
23:65:014:0	My servants will sing for joy , but you will cry in sorrow and despair .
23:65:015:0	Your name will be a curse word among my people , for the Sovereign Lord will destroy youand will call his true servants by another name .
23:65:016:0	All who invoke a blessing or take an oathwill do so by the God of truth.For I will put aside my angerand forget the evil of earlier days .
23:65:017:0	“ Look ! I am creating new heavens and a new earth , and no one will even think about the old ones anymore .
23:65:018:0	Be glad ; rejoice forever in my creation ! And look ! I will create Jerusalem as a place of happiness.Her people will be a source of joy .
23:65:019:0	I will rejoice over Jerusalemand delight in my people.And the sound of weeping and cryingwill be heard in it no more .
23:65:020:0	“ No longer will babies die when only a few days old.No longer will adults die before they have lived a full life.No longer will people be considered old at one hundred ! Only the cursed will die that young !
23:65:021:0	In those days people will live in the houses they buildand eat the fruit of their own vineyards .
23:65:022:0	Unlike the past , invaders will not take their housesand confiscate their vineyards.For my people will live as long as trees , and my chosen ones will have time to enjoy their hard-won gains .
23:65:023:0	They will not work in vain , and their children will not be doomed to misfortune.For they are people blessed by the Lord , and their children , too , will be blessed .
23:65:024:0	I will answer them before they even call to me.While they are still talking about their needs , I will go ahead and answer their prayers !
23:65:025:0	The wolf and the lamb will feed together.The lion will eat hay like a cow.But the snakes will eat dust.In those days no one will be hurt or destroyed on my holy mountain.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
