23:34:001:1	A Message for the Nations
23:34:001:0	Come here and listen , O nations of the earth.Let the world and everything in it hear my words .
23:34:002:0	For the Lord is enraged against the nations.His fury is against all their armies.He will completely destroy them , dooming them to slaughter .
23:34:003:0	Their dead will be left unburied , and the stench of rotting bodies will fill the land.The mountains will flow with their blood .
23:34:004:0	The heavens above will melt awayand disappear like a rolled-up scroll.The stars will fall from the skylike withered leaves from a grapevine , or shriveled figs from a fig tree .
23:34:005:0	And when my sword has finished its work in the heavens , it will fall upon Edom , the nation I have marked for destruction .
23:34:006:0	The sword of the Lord is drenched with bloodand covered with fat — with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of rams prepared for sacrifice.Yes , the Lord will offer a sacrifice in the city of Bozrah.He will make a mighty slaughter in Edom .
23:34:007:0	Even men as strong as wild oxen will die — the young men alongside the veterans.The land will be soaked with bloodand the soil enriched with fat .
23:34:008:0	For it is the day of the Lord 's revenge , the year when Edom will be paid back for all it did to Israel .
23:34:009:0	The streams of Edom will be filled with burning pitch , and the ground will be covered with fire .
23:34:010:0	This judgment on Edom will never end ; the smoke of its burning will rise forever.The land will lie deserted from generation to generation.No one will live there anymore .
23:34:011:0	It will be haunted by the desert owl and the screech owl , the great owl and the raven.For God will measure that land carefully ; he will measure it for chaos and destruction .
23:34:012:0	It will be called the Land of Nothing , and all its nobles will soon be gone .
23:34:013:0	Thorns will overrun its palaces ; nettles and thistles will grow in its forts.The ruins will become a haunt for jackalsand a home for owls .
23:34:014:0	Desert animals will mingle there with hyenas , their howls filling the night.Wild goats will bleat at one another among the ruins , and night creatures will come there to rest .
23:34:015:0	There the owl will make her nest and lay her eggs.She will hatch her young and cover them with her wings.And the buzzards will come , each one with its mate .
23:34:016:0	Search the book of the Lord , and see what he will do.Not one of these birds and animals will be missing , and none will lack a mate , for the Lord has promised this.His Spirit will make it all come true .
23:34:017:0	He has surveyed and divided the landand deeded it over to those creatures.They will possess it forever , from generation to generation .
