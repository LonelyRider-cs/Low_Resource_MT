23:66:001:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool.Could you build me a temple as good as that ? Could you build me such a resting place ?
23:66:002:0	My hands have made both heaven and earth ; they and everything in them are mine.I , the Lord , have spoken ! “ I will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts , who tremble at my word .
23:66:003:0	But those who choose their own ways — delighting in their detestable sins — will not have their offerings accepted.When such people sacrifice a bull , it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice.When they sacrifice a lamb , it 's as though they had sacrificed a dog ! When they bring an offering of grain , they might as well offer the blood of a pig.When they burn frankincense , it 's as if they had blessed an idol .
23:66:004:0	I will send them great trouble — all the things they feared.For when I called , they did not answer.When I spoke , they did not listen.They deliberately sinned before my very eyesand chose to do what they know I despise . ”
23:66:005:0	Hear this message from the Lord , all you who tremble at his words : “ Your own people hate youand throw you out for being loyal to my name. ‘ Let the Lord be honored ! ' they scoff. ‘ Be joyful in him ! 'But they will be put to shame .
23:66:006:0	What is all the commotion in the city ? What is that terrible noise from the Temple ? It is the voice of the Lordtaking vengeance against his enemies .
23:66:007:0	“ Before the birth pains even begin , Jerusalem gives birth to a son .
23:66:008:0	Who has ever seen anything as strange as this ? Who ever heard of such a thing ? Has a nation ever been born in a single day ? Has a country ever come forth in a mere moment ? But by the time Jerusalem 's birth pains begin , her children will be born .
23:66:009:0	Would I ever bring this nation to the point of birthand then not deliver it ? ” asks the Lord. “ No ! I would never keep this nation from being born , ” says your God .
23:66:010:0	“ Rejoice with Jerusalem ! Be glad with her , all you who love herand all you who mourn for her .
23:66:011:0	Drink deeply of her gloryeven as an infant drinks at its mother 's comforting breasts . ”
23:66:012:0	This is what the Lord says : “ I will give Jerusalem a river of peace and prosperity.The wealth of the nations will flow to her.Her children will be nursed at her breasts , carried in her arms , and held on her lap .
23:66:013:0	I will comfort you there in Jerusalemas a mother comforts her child . ”
23:66:014:0	When you see these things , your heart will rejoice.You will flourish like the grass ! Everyone will see the Lord 's hand of blessing on his servants — and his anger against his enemies .
23:66:015:0	See , the Lord is coming with fire , and his swift chariots roar like a whirlwind.He will bring punishment with the fury of his angerand the flaming fire of his hot rebuke .
23:66:016:0	The Lord will punish the world by fireand by his sword.He will judge the earth , and many will be killed by him .
23:66:017:0	“ Those who ‘ consecrate ' and ‘ purify ' themselves in a sacred garden with its idol in the center — feasting on pork and rats and other detestable meats — will come to a terrible end , ” says the Lord .
23:66:018:0	“ I can see what they are doing , and I know what they are thinking . So I will gather all nations and peoples together , and they will see my glory .
23:66:019:0	I will perform a sign among them . And I will send those who survive to be messengers to the nations — to Tarshish , to the Libyans and Lydians ( who are famous as archers ) , to Tubal and Greece , and to all the lands beyond the sea that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory . There they will declare my glory to the nations .
23:66:020:0	They will bring the remnant of your people back from every nation . They will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord . They will ride on horses , in chariots and wagons , and on mules and camels , ” says the Lord .
23:66:021:0	“ And I will appoint some of them to be my priests and Levites . I , the Lord , have spoken !
23:66:022:0	“ As surely as my new heavens and earth will remain , so will you always be my people , with a name that will never disappear , ” says the Lord .
23:66:023:0	“ All humanity will come to worship mefrom week to weekand from month to month .
23:66:024:0	And as they go out , they will seethe dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me.For the worms that devour them will never die , and the fire that burns them will never go out.All who pass bywill view them with utter horror . ”
