23:45:001:1	Cyrus , the
23:45:002:1	Lord
23:45:003:1	's Chosen One
23:45:001:0	This is what the Lord says to Cyrus , his anointed one , whose right hand he will empower.Before him , mighty kings will be paralyzed with fear.Their fortress gates will be opened , never to shut again .
23:45:002:0	This is what the Lord says : “ I will go before you , Cyrus , and level the mountains.I will smash down gates of bronzeand cut through bars of iron .
23:45:003:0	And I will give you treasures hidden in the darkness—secret riches.I will do this so you may know that I am the Lord , the God of Israel , the one who calls you by name .
23:45:004:0	“ And why have I called you for this work ? Why did I call you by name when you did not know me ? It is for the sake of Jacob my servant , Israel my chosen one .
23:45:005:0	I am the Lord ; there is no other God.I have equipped you for battle , though you do n't even know me ,
23:45:006:0	so all the world from east to westwill know there is no other God.I am the Lord , and there is no other .
23:45:007:0	I create the light and make the darkness.I send good times and bad times.I , the Lord , am the one who does these things .
23:45:008:0	“ Open up , O heavens , and pour out your righteousness.Let the earth open wideso salvation and righteousness can sprout up together.I , the Lord , created them .
23:45:009:0	“ What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.Does a clay pot argue with its maker ? Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it , saying , ‘ Stop , you 're doing it wrong ! 'Does the pot exclaim , ‘ How clumsy can you be ? '
23:45:010:0	How terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father , ‘ Why was I born ? 'or if it said to its mother , ‘ Why did you make me this way ? ' ”
23:45:011:0	This is what the Lord says—the Holy One of Israel and your Creator : “ Do you question what I do for my children ? Do you give me orders about the work of my hands ?
23:45:012:0	I am the one who made the earthand created people to live on it.With my hands I stretched out the heavens.All the stars are at my command .
23:45:004:1	Future Conversion of Gentiles
23:45:013:0	I will raise up Cyrus to fulfill my righteous purpose , and I will guide his actions.He will restore my city and free my captive people—without seeking a reward ! I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken ! ”
23:45:014:0	This is what the Lord says : “ You will rule the Egyptians , the Ethiopians , and the Sabeans.They will come to you with all their merchandise , and it will all be yours.They will follow you as prisoners in chains.They will fall to their knees in front of you and say , ‘ God is with you , and he is the only God.There is no other . ' ”
23:45:015:0	Truly , O God of Israel , our Savior , you work in mysterious ways .
23:45:016:0	All craftsmen who make idols will be humiliated.They will all be disgraced together .
23:45:017:0	But the Lord will save the people of Israelwith eternal salvation.Throughout everlasting ages , they will never again be humiliated and disgraced .
23:45:018:0	For the Lord is God , and he created the heavens and earthand put everything in place.He made the world to be lived in , not to be a place of empty chaos. “ I am the Lord , ” he says , “ and there is no other .
23:45:019:0	I publicly proclaim bold promises.I do not whisper obscurities in some dark corner.I would not have told the people of Israel to seek meif I could not be found.I , the Lord , speak only what is trueand declare only what is right .
23:45:020:0	“ Gather together and come , you fugitives from surrounding nations.What fools they are who carry around their wooden idolsand pray to gods that can not save !
23:45:021:0	Consult together , argue your case.Get together and decide what to say.Who made these things known so long ago ? What idol ever told you they would happen ? Was it not I , the Lord ? For there is no other God but me , a righteous God and Savior.There is none but me .
23:45:022:0	Let all the world look to me for salvation ! For I am God ; there is no other .
23:45:023:0	I have sworn by my own name ; I have spoken the truth , and I will never go back on my word : Every knee will bend to me , and every tongue will declare allegiance to me . ”
23:45:024:0	The people will declare , “ The Lord is the source of all my righteousness and strength. ” And all who were angry with himwill come to him and be ashamed .
23:45:025:0	In the Lord all the generations of Israel will be justified , and in him they will boast .
