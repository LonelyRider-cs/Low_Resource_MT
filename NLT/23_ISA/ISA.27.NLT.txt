23:27:001:0	In that day the Lord will take his terrible , swift sword and punish Leviathan , the swiftly moving serpent , the coiling , writhing serpent . He will kill the dragon of the sea .
23:27:002:0	“ In that day , sing about the fruitful vineyard .
23:27:003:0	I , the Lord , will watch over it , watering it carefully.Day and night I will watch so no one can harm it .
23:27:004:0	My anger will be gone.If I find briers and thorns growing , I will attack them ; I will burn them up —
23:27:005:0	unless they turn to me for help.Let them make peace with me ; yes , let them make peace with me . ”
23:27:006:0	The time is coming when Jacob 's descendants will take root.Israel will bud and blossomand fill the whole earth with fruit !
23:27:007:0	Has the Lord struck Israelas he struck her enemies ? Has he punished heras he punished them ?
23:27:008:0	No , but he exiled Israel to call her to account.She was exiled from her landas though blown away in a storm from the east .
23:27:009:0	The Lord did this to purge Israel 's wickedness , to take away all her sin.As a result , all the pagan altars will be crushed to dust.No Asherah pole or pagan shrine will be left standing .
23:27:010:0	The fortified towns will be silent and empty , the houses abandoned , the streets overgrown with weeds.Calves will graze there , chewing on twigs and branches .
23:27:011:0	The people are like the dead branches of a tree , broken off and used for kindling beneath the cooking pots.Israel is a foolish and stupid nation , for its people have turned away from God.Therefore , the one who made themwill show them no pity or mercy .
23:27:012:0	Yet the time will come when the Lord will gather them together like handpicked grain . One by one he will gather them — from the Euphrates River in the east to the Brook of Egypt in the west .
23:27:013:0	In that day the great trumpet will sound . Many who were dying in exile in Assyria and Egypt will return to Jerusalem to worship the Lord on his holy mountain .
