23:53:001:0	Who has believed our message ? To whom has the Lord revealed his powerful arm ?
23:53:002:0	My servant grew up in the Lord 's presence like a tender green shoot , like a root in dry ground.There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance , nothing to attract us to him .
23:53:003:0	He was despised and rejected â€” a man of sorrows , acquainted with deepest grief.We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.He was despised , and we did not care .
23:53:004:0	Yet it was our weaknesses he carried ; it was our sorrows that weighed him down.And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God , a punishment for his own sins !
23:53:005:0	But he was pierced for our rebellion , crushed for our sins.He was beaten so we could be whole.He was whipped so we could be healed .
23:53:006:0	All of us , like sheep , have strayed away.We have left God 's paths to follow our own.Yet the Lord laid on himthe sins of us all .
23:53:007:0	He was oppressed and treated harshly , yet he never said a word.He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.And as a sheep is silent before the shearers , he did not open his mouth .
23:53:008:0	Unjustly condemned , he was led away.No one cared that he died without descendants , that his life was cut short in midstream.But he was struck downfor the rebellion of my people .
23:53:009:0	He had done no wrongand had never deceived anyone.But he was buried like a criminal ; he was put in a rich man 's grave .
23:53:010:0	But it was the Lord 's good plan to crush himand cause him grief.Yet when his life is made an offering for sin , he will have many descendants.He will enjoy a long life , and the Lord 's good plan will prosper in his hands .
23:53:011:0	When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish , he will be satisfied.And because of his experience , my righteous servant will make it possiblefor many to be counted righteous , for he will bear all their sins .
23:53:012:0	I will give him the honors of a victorious soldier , because he exposed himself to death.He was counted among the rebels.He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels .
