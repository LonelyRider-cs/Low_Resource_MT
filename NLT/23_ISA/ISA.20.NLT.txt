23:20:001:1	A Message about Egypt and Ethiopia
23:20:001:0	In the year when King Sargon of Assyria sent his commander in chief to capture the Philistine city of Ashdod ,
23:20:002:0	the Lord told Isaiah son of Amoz , “ Take off the burlap you have been wearing , and remove your sandals. ” Isaiah did as he was told and walked around naked and barefoot .
23:20:003:0	Then the Lord said , “ My servant Isaiah has been walking around naked and barefoot for the last three years . This is a sign — a symbol of the terrible troubles I will bring upon Egypt and Ethiopia .
23:20:004:0	For the king of Assyria will take away the Egyptians and Ethiopians as prisoners . He will make them walk naked and barefoot , both young and old , their buttocks bared , to the shame of Egypt .
23:20:005:0	Then the Philistines will be thrown into panic , for they counted on the power of Ethiopia and boasted of their allies in Egypt !
23:20:006:0	They will say , ‘ If this can happen to Egypt , what chance do we have ? We were counting on Egypt to protect us from the king of Assyria . ' ”
