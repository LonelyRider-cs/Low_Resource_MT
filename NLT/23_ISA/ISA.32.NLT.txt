23:32:001:1	Israel 's Ultimate Deliverance
23:32:001:0	Look , a righteous king is coming ! And honest princes will rule under him .
23:32:002:0	Each one will be like a shelter from the windand a refuge from the storm , like streams of water in the desertand the shadow of a great rock in a parched land .
23:32:003:0	Then everyone who has eyes will be able to see the truth , and everyone who has ears will be able to hear it .
23:32:004:0	Even the hotheads will be full of sense and understanding.Those who stammer will speak out plainly .
23:32:005:0	In that day ungodly fools will not be heroes.Scoundrels will not be respected .
23:32:006:0	For fools speak foolishnessand make evil plans.They practice ungodlinessand spread false teachings about the Lord.They deprive the hungry of foodand give no water to the thirsty .
23:32:007:0	The smooth tricks of scoundrels are evil.They plot crooked schemes.They lie to convict the poor , even when the cause of the poor is just .
23:32:008:0	But generous people plan to do what is generous , and they stand firm in their generosity .
23:32:009:0	Listen , you women who lie around in ease.Listen to me , you who are so smug .
23:32:010:0	In a short time — just a little more than a year — you careless ones will suddenly begin to care.For your fruit crops will fail , and the harvest will never take place .
23:32:011:0	Tremble , you women of ease ; throw off your complacency.Strip off your pretty clothes , and put on burlap to show your grief .
23:32:012:0	Beat your breasts in sorrow for your bountiful farmsand your fruitful grapevines .
23:32:013:0	For your land will be overgrown with thorns and briers.Your joyful homes and happy towns will be gone .
23:32:014:0	The palace and the city will be deserted , and busy towns will be empty.Wild donkeys will frolic and flocks will grazein the empty forts and watchtowers
23:32:015:0	until at last the Spirit is poured outon us from heaven.Then the wilderness will become a fertile field , and the fertile field will yield bountiful crops .
23:32:016:0	Justice will rule in the wildernessand righteousness in the fertile field .
23:32:017:0	And this righteousness will bring peace.Yes , it will bring quietness and confidence forever .
23:32:018:0	My people will live in safety , quietly at home.They will be at rest .
23:32:019:0	Even if the forest should be destroyedand the city torn down ,
23:32:020:0	the Lord will greatly bless his people.Wherever they plant seed , bountiful crops will spring up.Their cattle and donkeys will graze freely .
