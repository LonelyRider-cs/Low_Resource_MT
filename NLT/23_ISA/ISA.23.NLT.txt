23:23:001:1	A Message about Tyre
23:23:001:0	This message came to me concerning Tyre : Wail , you trading ships of Tarshish , for the harbor and houses of Tyre are gone ! The rumors you heard in Cyprusare all true .
23:23:002:0	Mourn in silence , you people of the coastand you merchants of Sidon.Your traders crossed the sea ,
23:23:003:0	sailing over deep waters.They brought you grain from Egyptand harvests from along the Nile.You were the marketplace of the world .
23:23:004:0	But now you are put to shame , city of Sidon , for Tyre , the fortress of the sea , says , “ Now I am childless ; I have no sons or daughters . ”
23:23:005:0	When Egypt hears the news about Tyre , there will be great sorrow .
23:23:006:0	Send word now to Tarshish ! Wail , you people who live in distant lands !
23:23:007:0	Is this silent ruin all that is left of your once joyous city ? What a long history was yours ! Think of all the colonists you sent to distant places .
23:23:008:0	Who has brought this disaster on Tyre , that great creator of kingdoms ? Her traders were all princes , her merchants were nobles .
23:23:009:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies has done itto destroy your prideand bring low all earth 's nobility .
23:23:010:0	Come , people of Tarshish , sweep over the land like the flooding Nile , for Tyre is defenseless .
23:23:011:0	The Lord held out his hand over the seaand shook the kingdoms of the earth.He has spoken out against Phoenicia , ordering that her fortresses be destroyed .
23:23:012:0	He says , “ Never again will you rejoice , O daughter of Sidon , for you have been crushed.Even if you flee to Cyprus , you will find no rest . ”
23:23:013:0	Look at the land of Babylonia — the people of that land are gone ! The Assyrians have handed Babylon overto the wild animals of the desert.They have built siege ramps against its walls , torn down its palaces , and turned it to a heap of rubble .
23:23:014:0	Wail , you ships of Tarshish , for your harbor is destroyed !
23:23:015:0	For seventy years , the length of a king 's life , Tyre will be forgotten . But then the city will come back to life as in the song about the prostitute :
23:23:016:0	Take a harp and walk the streets , you forgotten harlot.Make sweet melody and sing your songsso you will be remembered again .
23:23:017:0	Yes , after seventy years the Lord will revive Tyre . But she will be no different than she was before . She will again be a prostitute to all kingdoms around the world .
23:23:018:0	But in the end her profits will be given to the Lord . Her wealth will not be hoarded but will provide good food and fine clothing for the Lord 's priests .
