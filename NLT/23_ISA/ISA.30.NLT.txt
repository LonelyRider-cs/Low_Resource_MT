23:30:001:1	Judah 's Worthless Treaty with Egypt
23:30:001:0	“ What sorrow awaits my rebellious children , ” says the Lord. “ You make plans that are contrary to mine.You make alliances not directed by my Spirit , thus piling up your sins .
23:30:002:0	For without consulting me , you have gone down to Egypt for help.You have put your trust in Pharaoh 's protection.You have tried to hide in his shade .
23:30:003:0	But by trusting Pharaoh , you will be humiliated , and by depending on him , you will be disgraced .
23:30:004:0	For though his power extends to Zoanand his officials have arrived in Hanes ,
23:30:005:0	all who trust in him will be ashamed.He will not help you.Instead , he will disgrace you . ”
23:30:006:0	This message came to me concerning the animals in the Negev : The caravan moves slowlyacross the terrible desert to Egypt—donkeys weighed down with richesand camels loaded with treasure—all to pay for Egypt 's protection.They travel through the wilderness , a place of lionesses and lions , a place where vipers and poisonous snakes live.All this , and Egypt will give you nothing in return .
23:30:002:1	A Warning for Rebellious Judah
23:30:007:0	Egypt 's promises are worthless ! Therefore , I call her Rahab—the Harmless Dragon .
23:30:008:0	Now go and write down these words.Write them in a book.They will stand until the end of timeas a witness
23:30:009:0	that these people are stubborn rebelswho refuse to pay attention to the Lord 's instructions .
23:30:010:0	They tell the seers , “ Stop seeing visions ! ” They tell the prophets , “ Do n't tell us what is right.Tell us nice things.Tell us lies .
23:30:011:0	Forget all this gloom.Get off your narrow path.Stop telling us about your ‘ Holy One of Israel . ' ”
23:30:012:0	This is the reply of the Holy One of Israel : “ Because you despise what I tell youand trust instead in oppression and lies ,
23:30:013:0	calamity will come upon you suddenly—like a bulging wall that bursts and falls.In an instant it will collapseand come crashing down .
23:30:014:0	You will be smashed like a piece of pottery—shattered so completely thatthere wo n't be a piece big enoughto carry coals from a fireplaceor a little water from the well . ”
23:30:015:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord , the Holy One of Israel , says : “ Only in returning to meand resting in me will you be saved.In quietness and confidence is your strength.But you would have none of it .
23:30:016:0	You said , ‘ No , we will get our help from Egypt.They will give us swift horses for riding into battle . 'But the only swiftness you are going to seeis the swiftness of your enemies chasing you !
23:30:003:1	Blessings for the
23:30:004:1	Lord
23:30:005:1	's People
23:30:017:0	One of them will chase a thousand of you.Five of them will make all of you flee.You will be left like a lonely flagpole on a hillor a tattered banner on a distant mountaintop . ”
23:30:018:0	So the Lord must wait for you to come to himso he can show you his love and compassion.For the Lord is a faithful God.Blessed are those who wait for his help .
23:30:019:0	O people of Zion , who live in Jerusalem , you will weep no more.He will be gracious if you ask for help.He will surely respond to the sound of your cries .
23:30:020:0	Though the Lord gave you adversity for foodand suffering for drink , he will still be with you to teach you.You will see your teacher with your own eyes .
23:30:021:0	Your own ears will hear him.Right behind you a voice will say , “ This is the way you should go , ” whether to the right or to the left .
23:30:022:0	Then you will destroy all your silver idolsand your precious gold images.You will throw them out like filthy rags , saying to them , “ Good riddance ! ”
23:30:023:0	Then the Lord will bless you with rain at planting time . There will be wonderful harvests and plenty of pastureland for your livestock .
23:30:024:0	The oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat good grain , its chaff blown away by the wind .
23:30:025:0	In that day , when your enemies are slaughtered and the towers fall , there will be streams of water flowing down every mountain and hill .
23:30:026:0	The moon will be as bright as the sun , and the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days in one ! So it will be when the Lord begins to heal his people and cure the wounds he gave them .
23:30:027:0	Look ! The Lord is coming from far away , burning with anger , surrounded by thick , rising smoke.His lips are filled with fury ; his words consume like fire .
23:30:028:0	His hot breath pours out like a floodup to the neck of his enemies.He will sift out the proud nations for destruction.He will bridle them and lead them away to ruin .
23:30:029:0	But the people of God will sing a song of joy , like the songs at the holy festivals.You will be filled with joy , as when a flutist leads a group of pilgrimsto Jerusalem , the mountain of the Lord—to the Rock of Israel .
23:30:030:0	And the Lord will make his majestic voice heard.He will display the strength of his mighty arm.It will descend with devouring flames , with cloudbursts , thunderstorms , and huge hailstones .
23:30:031:0	At the Lord 's command , the Assyrians will be shattered.He will strike them down with his royal scepter .
23:30:032:0	And as the Lord strikes them with his rod of punishment , his people will celebrate with tambourines and harps.Lifting his mighty arm , he will fight the Assyrians .
23:30:033:0	Topheth—the place of burning—has long been ready for the Assyrian king ; the pyre is piled high with wood.The breath of the Lord , like fire from a volcano , will set it ablaze .
