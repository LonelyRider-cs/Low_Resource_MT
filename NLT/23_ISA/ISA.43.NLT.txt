23:43:001:1	The Savior of Israel
23:43:001:0	But now , O Jacob , listen to the Lord who created you.O Israel , the one who formed you says , “ Do not be afraid , for I have ransomed you.I have called you by name ; you are mine .
23:43:002:0	When you go through deep waters , I will be with you.When you go through rivers of difficulty , you will not drown.When you walk through the fire of oppression , you will not be burned up ; the flames will not consume you .
23:43:003:0	For I am the Lord , your God , the Holy One of Israel , your Savior.I gave Egypt as a ransom for your freedom ; I gave Ethiopia and Seba in your place .
23:43:004:0	Others were given in exchange for you.I traded their lives for yoursbecause you are precious to me.You are honored , and I love you .
23:43:005:0	“ Do not be afraid , for I am with you.I will gather you and your children from east and west .
23:43:006:0	I will say to the north and south , ‘ Bring my sons and daughters back to Israelfrom the distant corners of the earth .
23:43:007:0	Bring all who claim me as their God , for I have made them for my glory.It was I who created them . ' ”
23:43:008:0	Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind , who have ears but are deaf .
23:43:009:0	Gather the nations together ! Assemble the peoples of the world ! Which of their idols has ever foretold such things ? Which can predict what will happen tomorrow ? Where are the witnesses of such predictions ? Who can verify that they spoke the truth ?
23:43:010:0	“ But you are my witnesses , O Israel ! ” says the Lord. “ You are my servant.You have been chosen to know me , believe in me , and understand that I alone am God.There is no other God—there never has been , and there never will be .
23:43:011:0	I , yes I , am the Lord , and there is no other Savior .
23:43:012:0	First I predicted your rescue , then I saved you and proclaimed it to the world.No foreign god has ever done this.You are witnesses that I am the only God , ” says the Lord .
23:43:002:1	The
23:43:003:1	Lord
23:43:004:1	's Promise of Victory
23:43:013:0	“ From eternity to eternity I am God.No one can snatch anyone out of my hand.No one can undo what I have done . ”
23:43:014:0	This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : “ For your sakes I will send an army against Babylon , forcing the Babylonians to flee in those ships they are so proud of .
23:43:015:0	I am the Lord , your Holy One , Israel 's Creator and King .
23:43:016:0	I am the Lord , who opened a way through the waters , making a dry path through the sea .
23:43:017:0	I called forth the mighty army of Egyptwith all its chariots and horses.I drew them beneath the waves , and they drowned , their lives snuffed out like a smoldering candlewick .
23:43:018:0	“ But forget all that—it is nothing compared to what I am going to do .
23:43:019:0	For I am about to do something new.See , I have already begun ! Do you not see it ? I will make a pathway through the wilderness.I will create rivers in the dry wasteland .
23:43:020:0	The wild animals in the fields will thank me , the jackals and owls , too , for giving them water in the desert.Yes , I will make rivers in the dry wastelandso my chosen people can be refreshed .
23:43:021:0	I have made Israel for myself , and they will someday honor me before the whole world .
23:43:022:0	“ But , dear family of Jacob , you refuse to ask for my help.You have grown tired of me , O Israel !
23:43:023:0	You have not brought me sheep or goats for burnt offerings.You have not honored me with sacrifices , though I have not burdened and wearied youwith requests for grain offerings and frankincense .
23:43:024:0	You have not brought me fragrant calamusor pleased me with the fat from sacrifices.Instead , you have burdened me with your sinsand wearied me with your faults .
23:43:025:0	“ I—yes , I alone—will blot out your sins for my own sakeand will never think of them again .
23:43:026:0	Let us review the situation together , and you can present your case to prove your innocence .
23:43:027:0	From the very beginning , your first ancestor sinned against me ; all your leaders broke my laws .
23:43:028:0	That is why I have disgraced your priests ; I have decreed complete destruction for Jacoband shame for Israel .
