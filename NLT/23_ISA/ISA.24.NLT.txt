23:24:001:1	Destruction of the Earth
23:24:001:0	Look ! The Lord is about to destroy the earthand make it a vast wasteland.He devastates the surface of the earthand scatters the people .
23:24:002:0	Priests and laypeople , servants and masters , maids and mistresses , buyers and sellers , lenders and borrowers , bankers and debtors—none will be spared .
23:24:003:0	The earth will be completely emptied and looted.The Lord has spoken !
23:24:004:0	The earth mourns and dries up , and the land wastes away and withers.Even the greatest people on earth waste away .
23:24:005:0	The earth suffers for the sins of its people , for they have twisted God 's instructions , violated his laws , and broken his everlasting covenant .
23:24:006:0	Therefore , a curse consumes the earth.Its people must pay the price for their sin.They are destroyed by fire , and only a few are left alive .
23:24:007:0	The grapevines waste away , and there is no new wine.All the merrymakers sigh and mourn .
23:24:008:0	The cheerful sound of tambourines is stilled ; the happy cries of celebration are heard no more.The melodious chords of the harp are silent .
23:24:009:0	Gone are the joys of wine and song ; alcoholic drink turns bitter in the mouth .
23:24:010:0	The city writhes in chaos ; every home is locked to keep out intruders .
23:24:011:0	Mobs gather in the streets , crying out for wine.Joy has turned to gloom.Gladness has been banished from the land .
23:24:012:0	The city is left in ruins , its gates battered down .
23:24:013:0	Throughout the earth the story is the same—only a remnant is left , like the stray olives left on the treeor the few grapes left on the vine after harvest .
23:24:014:0	But all who are left shout and sing for joy.Those in the west praise the Lord 's majesty .
23:24:015:0	In eastern lands , give glory to the Lord.In the lands beyond the sea , praise the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
23:24:016:0	We hear songs of praise from the ends of the earth , songs that give glory to the Righteous One ! But my heart is heavy with grief.Weep for me , for I wither away.Deceit still prevails , and treachery is everywhere .
23:24:017:0	Terror and traps and snares will be your lot , you people of the earth .
23:24:018:0	Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap , and those who escape the trap will be caught in a snare.Destruction falls like rain from the heavens ; the foundations of the earth shake .
23:24:019:0	The earth has broken up.It has utterly collapsed ; it is violently shaken .
23:24:020:0	The earth staggers like a drunk.It trembles like a tent in a storm.It falls and will not rise again , for the guilt of its rebellion is very heavy .
23:24:021:0	In that day the Lord will punish the gods in the heavensand the proud rulers of the nations on earth .
23:24:022:0	They will be rounded up and put in prison.They will be shut up in prisonand will finally be punished .
23:24:023:0	Then the glory of the moon will wane , and the brightness of the sun will fade , for the Lord of Heaven 's Armies will rule on Mount Zion.He will rule in great glory in Jerusalem , in the sight of all the leaders of his people .
