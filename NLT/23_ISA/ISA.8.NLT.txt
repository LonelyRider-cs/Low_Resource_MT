23:8:001:1	The Coming Assyrian Invasion
23:8:001:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Make a large signboard and clearly write this name on it : Maher-shalal-hash-baz . ”
23:8:002:0	I asked Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah , both known as honest men , to witness my doing this .
23:8:003:0	Then I slept with my wife , and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . And the Lord said , “ Call him Maher-shalal-hash-baz .
23:8:004:0	For before this child is old enough to say ‘ Papa ' or ‘ Mama , ' the king of Assyria will carry away both the abundance of Damascus and the riches of Samaria . ”
23:8:005:0	Then the Lord spoke to me again and said ,
23:8:006:0	“ My care for the people of Judah is like the gently flowing waters of Shiloah , but they have rejected it . They are rejoicing over what will happen to King Rezin and King Pekah .
23:8:007:0	Therefore , the Lord will overwhelm them with a mighty flood from the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his glory . This flood will overflow all its channels
23:8:008:0	and sweep into Judah until it is chin deep . It will spread its wings , submerging your land from one end to the other , O Immanuel .
23:8:009:0	“ Huddle together , you nations , and be terrified.Listen , all you distant lands.Prepare for battle , but you will be crushed ! Yes , prepare for battle , but you will be crushed !
23:8:002:1	A Call to Trust the
23:8:003:1	Lord
23:8:010:0	Call your councils of war , but they will be worthless.Develop your strategies , but they will not succeed.For God is with us ! ”
23:8:011:0	The Lord has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else does . He said ,
23:8:012:0	“ Do n't call everything a conspiracy , like they do , and do n't live in dread of what frightens them .
23:8:013:0	Make the Lord of Heaven 's Armies holy in your life.He is the one you should fear.He is the one who should make you tremble .
23:8:014:0	He will keep you safe.But to Israel and Judahhe will be a stone that makes people stumble , a rock that makes them fall.And for the people of Jerusalemhe will be a trap and a snare .
23:8:015:0	Many will stumble and fall , never to rise again.They will be snared and captured . ”
23:8:016:0	Preserve the teaching of God ; entrust his instructions to those who follow me .
23:8:017:0	I will wait for the Lord , who has turned away from the descendants of Jacob.I will put my hope in him .
23:8:018:0	I and the children the Lord has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from the Lord of Heaven 's Armies who dwells in his Temple on Mount Zion .
23:8:019:0	Someone may say to you , “ Let 's ask the mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead . With their whisperings and mutterings , they will tell us what to do. ” But should n't people ask God for guidance ? Should the living seek guidance from the dead ?
23:8:020:0	Look to God 's instructions and teachings ! People who contradict his word are completely in the dark .
23:8:021:0	They will go from one place to another , weary and hungry . And because they are hungry , they will rage and curse their king and their God . They will look up to heaven
23:8:022:0	and down at the earth , but wherever they look , there will be trouble and anguish and dark despair . They will be thrown out into the darkness .
