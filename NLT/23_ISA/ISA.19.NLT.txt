23:19:001:1	A Message about Egypt
23:19:001:0	This message came to me concerning Egypt : Look ! The Lord is advancing against Egypt , riding on a swift cloud.The idols of Egypt tremble.The hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear .
23:19:002:0	“ I will make Egyptian fight against Egyptian—brother against brother , neighbor against neighbor , city against city , province against province .
23:19:003:0	The Egyptians will lose heart , and I will confuse their plans.They will plead with their idols for wisdomand call on spirits , mediums , and those who consult the spirits of the dead .
23:19:004:0	I will hand Egypt overto a hard , cruel master.A fierce king will rule them , ” says the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
23:19:005:0	The waters of the Nile will fail to rise and flood the fields.The riverbed will be parched and dry .
23:19:006:0	The canals of the Nile will dry up , and the streams of Egypt will stinkwith rotting reeds and rushes .
23:19:007:0	All the greenery along the riverbankand all the crops along the riverwill dry up and blow away .
23:19:008:0	The fishermen will lament for lack of work.Those who cast hooks into the Nile will groan , and those who use nets will lose heart .
23:19:009:0	There will be no flax for the harvesters , no thread for the weavers .
23:19:010:0	They will be in despair , and all the workers will be sick at heart .
23:19:011:0	What fools are the officials of Zoan ! Their best counsel to the king of Egypt is stupid and wrong.Will they still boast to Pharaoh of their wisdom ? Will they dare brag about all their wise ancestors ?
23:19:012:0	Where are your wise counselors , Pharaoh ? Let them tell you what God plans , what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies is going to do to Egypt .
23:19:013:0	The officials of Zoan are fools , and the officials of Memphis are deluded.The leaders of the peoplehave led Egypt astray .
23:19:014:0	The Lord has sent a spirit of foolishness on them , so all their suggestions are wrong.They cause Egypt to staggerlike a drunk in his vomit .
23:19:015:0	There is nothing Egypt can do.All are helpless—the head and the tail , the noble palm branch and the lowly reed .
23:19:016:0	In that day the Egyptians will be as weak as women . They will cower in fear beneath the upraised fist of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
23:19:017:0	Just to speak the name of Israel will terrorize them , for the Lord of Heaven 's Armies has laid out his plans against them .
23:19:018:0	In that day five of Egypt 's cities will follow the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . They will even begin to speak Hebrew , the language of Canaan . One of these cities will be Heliopolis , the City of the Sun .
23:19:019:0	In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt , and there will be a monument to the Lord at its border .
23:19:020:0	It will be a sign and a witness that the Lord of Heaven 's Armies is worshiped in the land of Egypt . When the people cry to the Lord for help against those who oppress them , he will send them a savior who will rescue them .
23:19:021:0	The Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians . Yes , they will know the Lord and will give their sacrifices and offerings to him . They will make a vow to the Lord and will keep it .
23:19:022:0	The Lord will strike Egypt , and then he will bring healing . For the Egyptians will turn to the Lord , and he will listen to their pleas and heal them .
23:19:023:0	In that day Egypt and Assyria will be connected by a highway . The Egyptians and Assyrians will move freely between their lands , and they will both worship God .
23:19:024:0	In that day Israel will be the third , along with Egypt and Assyria , a blessing in the midst of the earth .
23:19:025:0	For the Lord of Heaven 's Armies will say , “ Blessed be Egypt , my people . Blessed be Assyria , the land I have made . Blessed be Israel , my special possession ! ”
