23:56:001:1	Blessings for All Nations
23:56:001:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Be just and fair to all.Do what is right and good , for I am coming soon to rescue youand to display my righteousness among you .
23:56:002:0	Blessed are all thosewho are careful to do this.Blessed are those who honor my Sabbath days of restand keep themselves from doing wrong .
23:56:003:0	“ Do n't let foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord say , ‘ The Lord will never let me be part of his people . 'And do n't let the eunuchs say , ‘ I 'm a dried-up tree with no children and no future . '
23:56:004:0	For this is what the Lord says : I will bless those eunuchswho keep my Sabbath days holyand who choose to do what pleases meand commit their lives to me .
23:56:005:0	I will give them — within the walls of my house — a memorial and a namefar greater than sons and daughters could give.For the name I give them is an everlasting one.It will never disappear !
23:56:006:0	“ I will also bless the foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord , who serve him and love his name , who worship him and do not desecrate the Sabbath day of rest , and who hold fast to my covenant .
23:56:007:0	I will bring them to my holy mountain of Jerusalemand will fill them with joy in my house of prayer.I will accept their burnt offerings and sacrifices , because my Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations .
23:56:002:1	Sinful Leaders Condemned
23:56:008:0	For the Sovereign Lord , who brings back the outcasts of Israel , says : I will bring others , too , besides my people Israel . ”
23:56:009:0	Come , wild animals of the field ! Come , wild animals of the forest ! Come and devour my people !
23:56:010:0	For the leaders of my people — the Lord 's watchmen , his shepherds — are blind and ignorant.They are like silent watchdogsthat give no warning when danger comes.They love to lie around , sleeping and dreaming .
23:56:011:0	Like greedy dogs , they are never satisfied.They are ignorant shepherds , all following their own pathand intent on personal gain .
23:56:012:0	“ Come , ” they say , “ let 's get some wine and have a party.Let 's all get drunk.Then tomorrow we 'll do it againand have an even bigger party ! ”
