23:29:001:1	A Message about Jerusalem
23:29:001:0	“ What sorrow awaits Ariel , the City of David.Year after year you celebrate your feasts .
23:29:002:0	Yet I will bring disaster upon you , and there will be much weeping and sorrow.For Jerusalem will become what her name Ariel means — an altar covered with blood .
23:29:003:0	I will be your enemy , surrounding Jerusalem and attacking its walls.I will build siege towersand destroy it .
23:29:004:0	Then deep from the earth you will speak ; from low in the dust your words will come.Your voice will whisper from the groundlike a ghost conjured up from the grave .
23:29:005:0	“ But suddenly , your ruthless enemies will be crushedlike the finest of dust.Your many attackers will be driven awaylike chaff before the wind.Suddenly , in an instant ,
23:29:006:0	I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , will act for youwith thunder and earthquake and great noise , with whirlwind and storm and consuming fire .
23:29:007:0	All the nations fighting against Jerusalemwill vanish like a dream ! Those who are attacking her wallswill vanish like a vision in the night .
23:29:008:0	A hungry person dreams of eatingbut wakes up still hungry.A thirsty person dreams of drinkingbut is still faint from thirst when morning comes.So it will be with your enemies , with those who attack Mount Zion . ”
23:29:009:0	Are you amazed and incredulous ? Do n't you believe it ? Then go ahead and be blind.You are stupid , but not from wine ! You stagger , but not from liquor !
23:29:010:0	For the Lord has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep.He has closed the eyes of your prophets and visionaries .
23:29:011:0	All the future events in this vision are like a sealed book to them . When you give it to those who can read , they will say , “ We ca n't read it because it is sealed . ”
23:29:012:0	When you give it to those who can not read , they will say , “ We do n't know how to read . ”
23:29:013:0	And so the Lord says , “ These people say they are mine.They honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me.And their worship of meis nothing but man-made rules learned by rote .
23:29:014:0	Because of this , I will once again astound these hypocriteswith amazing wonders.The wisdom of the wise will pass away , and the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear . ”
23:29:015:0	What sorrow awaits those who try to hide their plans from the Lord , who do their evil deeds in the dark ! “ The Lord ca n't see us , ” they say. “ He does n't know what 's going on ! ”
23:29:016:0	How foolish can you be ? He is the Potter , and he is certainly greater than you , the clay ! Should the created thing say of the one who made it , “ He did n't make me ” ? Does a jar ever say , “ The potter who made me is stupid ” ?
23:29:017:0	Soon — and it will not be very long — the forests of Lebanon will become a fertile field , and the fertile field will yield bountiful crops .
23:29:018:0	In that day the deaf will hear words read from a book , and the blind will see through the gloom and darkness .
23:29:019:0	The humble will be filled with fresh joy from the Lord.The poor will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
23:29:020:0	The scoffer will be gone , the arrogant will disappear , and those who plot evil will be killed .
23:29:021:0	Those who convict the innocentby their false testimony will disappear.A similar fate awaits those who use trickery to pervert justiceand who tell lies to destroy the innocent .
23:29:022:0	That is why the Lord , who redeemed Abraham , says to the people of Israel , “ My people will no longer be ashamedor turn pale with fear .
23:29:023:0	For when they see their many childrenand all the blessings I have given them , they will recognize the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob.They will stand in awe of the God of Israel .
23:29:024:0	Then the wayward will gain understanding , and complainers will accept instruction .
