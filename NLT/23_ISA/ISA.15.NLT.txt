23:15:001:1	A Message about Moab
23:15:001:0	This message came to me concerning Moab : In one night the town of Ar will be leveled , and the city of Kir will be destroyed .
23:15:002:0	Your people will go to their temple in Dibon to mourn.They will go to their sacred shrines to weep.They will wail for the fate of Nebo and Medeba , shaving their heads in sorrow and cutting off their beards .
23:15:003:0	They will wear burlap as they wander the streets.From every home and public square will come the sound of wailing .
23:15:004:0	The people of Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out ; their voices will be heard as far away as Jahaz ! The bravest warriors of Moab will cry out in utter terror.They will be helpless with fear .
23:15:005:0	My heart weeps for Moab.Its people flee to Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah.Weeping , they climb the road to Luhith.Their cries of distress can be heard all along the road to Horonaim .
23:15:006:0	Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up ! The grassy banks are scorched.The tender plants are gone ; nothing green remains .
23:15:007:0	The people grab their possessionsand carry them across the Ravine of Willows .
23:15:008:0	A cry of distress echoes through the land of Moabfrom one end to the other — from Eglaim to Beer-elim .
23:15:009:0	The stream near Dibon runs red with blood , but I am still not finished with Dibon ! Lions will hunt down the survivors — both those who try to escapeand those who remain behind .
