23:6:001:1	Isaiah 's Cleansing and Call
23:6:001:0	It was in the year King Uzziah died that I saw the Lord . He was sitting on a lofty throne , and the train of his robe filled the Temple .
23:6:002:0	Attending him were mighty seraphim , each having six wings . With two wings they covered their faces , with two they covered their feet , and with two they flew .
23:6:003:0	They were calling out to each other , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord of Heaven 's Armies ! The whole earth is filled with his glory ! ”
23:6:004:0	Their voices shook the Temple to its foundations , and the entire building was filled with smoke .
23:6:005:0	Then I said , “ It 's all over ! I am doomed , for I am a sinful man . I have filthy lips , and I live among a people with filthy lips . Yet I have seen the King , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . ”
23:6:006:0	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs .
23:6:007:0	He touched my lips with it and said , “ See , this coal has touched your lips . Now your guilt is removed , and your sins are forgiven . ”
23:6:008:0	Then I heard the Lord asking , “ Whom should I send as a messenger to this people ? Who will go for us ? ” I said , “ Here I am . Send me . ”
23:6:009:0	And he said , “ Yes , go , and say to this people , ‘ Listen carefully , but do not understand.Watch closely , but learn nothing . '
23:6:010:0	Harden the hearts of these people.Plug their ears and shut their eyes.That way , they will not see with their eyes , nor hear with their ears , nor understand with their heartsand turn to me for healing . ”
23:6:011:0	Then I said , “ Lord , how long will this go on ? ” And he replied , “ Until their towns are empty , their houses are deserted , and the whole country is a wasteland ;
23:6:012:0	until the Lord has sent everyone away , and the entire land of Israel lies deserted .
23:6:013:0	If even a tenth — a remnant — survive , it will be invaded again and burned.But as a terebinth or oak tree leaves a stump when it is cut down , so Israel 's stump will be a holy seed . ”
