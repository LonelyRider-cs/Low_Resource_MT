23:38:001:1	Hezekiah 's Sickness and Recovery
23:38:001:0	About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill , and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to visit him . He gave the king this message : “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ Set your affairs in order , for you are going to die . You will not recover from this illness . ' ”
23:38:002:0	When Hezekiah heard this , he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord ,
23:38:003:0	“ Remember , O Lord , how I have always been faithful to you and have served you single-mindedly , always doing what pleases you. ” Then he broke down and wept bitterly .
23:38:004:0	Then this message came to Isaiah from the Lord :
23:38:005:0	“ Go back to Hezekiah and tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : I have heard your prayer and seen your tears . I will add fifteen years to your life ,
23:38:006:0	and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria . Yes , I will defend this city .
23:38:007:0	“ ‘ And this is the sign from the Lord to prove that he will do as he promised :
23:38:002:1	Hezekiah 's Poem of Praise
23:38:008:0	I will cause the sun 's shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial of Ahaz ! ' ” So the shadow on the sundial moved backward ten steps .
23:38:009:0	When King Hezekiah was well again , he wrote this poem :
23:38:010:0	I said , “ In the prime of my life , must I now enter the place of the dead ? Am I to be robbed of the rest of my years ? ”
23:38:011:0	I said , “ Never again will I see the Lord Godwhile still in the land of the living.Never again will I see my friendsor be with those who live in this world .
23:38:012:0	My life has been blown awaylike a shepherd 's tent in a storm.It has been cut short , as when a weaver cuts cloth from a loom.Suddenly , my life was over .
23:38:013:0	I waited patiently all night , but I was torn apart as though by lions.Suddenly , my life was over .
23:38:014:0	Delirious , I chattered like a swallow or a crane , and then I moaned like a mourning dove.My eyes grew tired of looking to heaven for help.I am in trouble , Lord . Help me ! ”
23:38:015:0	But what could I say ? For he himself sent this sickness.Now I will walk humbly throughout my yearsbecause of this anguish I have felt .
23:38:016:0	Lord , your discipline is good , for it leads to life and health.You restore my healthand allow me to live !
23:38:017:0	Yes , this anguish was good for me , for you have rescued me from deathand forgiven all my sins .
23:38:018:0	For the dead can not praise you ; they can not raise their voices in praise.Those who go down to the gravecan no longer hope in your faithfulness .
23:38:019:0	Only the living can praise you as I do today.Each generation tells of your faithfulness to the next .
23:38:020:0	Think of it—the Lord is ready to heal me ! I will sing his praises with instrumentsevery day of my lifein the Temple of the Lord .
23:38:021:0	Isaiah had said to Hezekiah 's servants , “ Make an ointment from figs and spread it over the boil , and Hezekiah will recover . ”
23:38:022:0	And Hezekiah had asked , “ What sign will prove that I will go to the Temple of the Lord ? ”
