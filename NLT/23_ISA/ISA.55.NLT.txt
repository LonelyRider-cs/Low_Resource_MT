23:55:001:1	Invitation to the
23:55:002:1	Lord
23:55:003:1	's Salvation
23:55:001:0	“ Is anyone thirsty ? Come and drink—even if you have no money ! Come , take your choice of wine or milk—it 's all free !
23:55:002:0	Why spend your money on food that does not give you strength ? Why pay for food that does you no good ? Listen to me , and you will eat what is good.You will enjoy the finest food .
23:55:003:0	“ Come to me with your ears wide open.Listen , and you will find life.I will make an everlasting covenant with you.I will give you all the unfailing love I promised to David .
23:55:004:0	See how I used him to display my power among the peoples.I made him a leader among the nations .
23:55:005:0	You also will command nations you do not know , and peoples unknown to you will come running to obey , because I , the Lord your God , the Holy One of Israel , have made you glorious . ”
23:55:006:0	Seek the Lord while you can find him.Call on him now while he is near .
23:55:007:0	Let the wicked change their waysand banish the very thought of doing wrong.Let them turn to the Lord that he may have mercy on them.Yes , turn to our God , for he will forgive generously .
23:55:008:0	“ My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts , ” says the Lord. “ And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine .
23:55:009:0	For just as the heavens are higher than the earth , so my ways are higher than your waysand my thoughts higher than your thoughts .
23:55:010:0	“ The rain and snow come down from the heavensand stay on the ground to water the earth.They cause the grain to grow , producing seed for the farmerand bread for the hungry .
23:55:011:0	It is the same with my word.I send it out , and it always produces fruit.It will accomplish all I want it to , and it will prosper everywhere I send it .
23:55:012:0	You will live in joy and peace.The mountains and hills will burst into song , and the trees of the field will clap their hands !
23:55:013:0	Where once there were thorns , cypress trees will grow.Where nettles grew , myrtles will sprout up.These events will bring great honor to the Lord 's name ; they will be an everlasting sign of his power and love . ”
