23:48:001:1	God 's Stubborn People
23:48:001:0	“ Listen to me , O family of Jacob , you who are called by the name of Israeland born into the family of Judah.Listen , you who take oaths in the name of the Lordand call on the God of Israel.You do n't keep your promises ,
23:48:002:0	even though you call yourself the holy cityand talk about depending on the God of Israel , whose name is the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
23:48:003:0	Long ago I told you what was going to happen.Then suddenly I took action , and all my predictions came true .
23:48:004:0	For I know how stubborn and obstinate you are.Your necks are as unbending as iron.Your heads are as hard as bronze .
23:48:005:0	That is why I told you what would happen ; I told you beforehand what I was going to do.Then you could never say , ‘ My idols did it.My wooden image and metal god commanded it to happen ! '
23:48:006:0	You have heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled , but you refuse to admit it.Now I will tell you new things , secrets you have not yet heard .
23:48:007:0	They are brand new , not things from the past.So you can not say , ‘ We knew that all the time ! '
23:48:008:0	“ Yes , I will tell you of things that are entirely new , things you never heard of before.For I know so well what traitors you are.You have been rebels from birth .
23:48:009:0	Yet for my own sake and for the honor of my name , I will hold back my anger and not wipe you out .
23:48:010:0	I have refined you , but not as silver is refined.Rather , I have refined you in the furnace of suffering .
23:48:002:1	Freedom from Babylon
23:48:011:0	I will rescue you for my sake—yes , for my own sake ! I will not let my reputation be tarnished , and I will not share my glory with idols !
23:48:012:0	“ Listen to me , O family of Jacob , Israel my chosen one ! I alone am God , the First and the Last .
23:48:013:0	It was my hand that laid the foundations of the earth , my right hand that spread out the heavens above.When I call out the stars , they all appear in order . ”
23:48:014:0	Have any of your idols ever told you this ? Come , all of you , and listen : The Lord has chosen Cyrus as his ally.He will use him to put an end to the empire of Babylonand to destroy the Babylonian armies .
23:48:015:0	“ I have said it : I am calling Cyrus ! I will send him on this errand and will help him succeed .
23:48:016:0	Come closer , and listen to this.From the beginning I have told you plainly what would happen. ” And now the Sovereign Lord and his Spirithave sent me with this message .
23:48:017:0	This is what the Lord says—your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : “ I am the Lord your God , who teaches you what is good for youand leads you along the paths you should follow .
23:48:018:0	Oh , that you had listened to my commands ! Then you would have had peace flowing like a gentle riverand righteousness rolling over you like waves in the sea .
23:48:019:0	Your descendants would have been like the sands along the seashore—too many to count ! There would have been no need for your destruction , or for cutting off your family name . ”
23:48:020:0	Yet even now , be free from your captivity ! Leave Babylon and the Babylonians.Sing out this message ! Shout it to the ends of the earth ! The Lord has redeemed his servants , the people of Israel .
23:48:021:0	They were not thirstywhen he led them through the desert.He divided the rock , and water gushed out for them to drink .
23:48:022:0	“ But there is no peace for the wicked , ” says the Lord .
