23:4:001:1	A Promise of Restoration
23:4:001:0	In that day so few men will be left that seven women will fight for each man , saying , “ Let us all marry you ! We will provide our own food and clothing . Only let us take your name so we wo n't be mocked as old maids . ”
23:4:002:0	But in that day , the branch of the Lordwill be beautiful and glorious ; the fruit of the land will be the pride and gloryof all who survive in Israel .
23:4:003:0	All who remain in Zionwill be a holy people—those who survive the destruction of Jerusalemand are recorded among the living .
23:4:004:0	The Lord will wash the filth from beautiful Zionand cleanse Jerusalem of its bloodstainswith the hot breath of fiery judgment .
23:4:005:0	Then the Lord will provide shade for Mount Zionand all who assemble there.He will provide a canopy of cloud during the dayand smoke and flaming fire at night , covering the glorious land .
23:4:006:0	It will be a shelter from daytime heatand a hiding place from storms and rain .
