23:54:001:1	Future Glory for Jerusalem
23:54:001:0	“ Sing , O childless woman , you who have never given birth ! Break into loud and joyful song , O Jerusalem , you who have never been in labor.For the desolate woman now has more childrenthan the woman who lives with her husband , ” says the Lord .
23:54:002:0	“ Enlarge your house ; build an addition.Spread out your home , and spare no expense !
23:54:003:0	For you will soon be bursting at the seams.Your descendants will occupy other nationsand resettle the ruined cities .
23:54:004:0	“ Fear not ; you will no longer live in shame.Do n't be afraid ; there is no more disgrace for you.You will no longer remember the shame of your youthand the sorrows of widowhood .
23:54:005:0	For your Creator will be your husband ; the Lord of Heaven 's Armies is his name ! He is your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , the God of all the earth .
23:54:006:0	For the Lord has called you back from your grief — as though you were a young wife abandoned by her husband , ” says your God .
23:54:007:0	“ For a brief moment I abandoned you , but with great compassion I will take you back .
23:54:008:0	In a burst of anger I turned my face away for a little while.But with everlasting love I will have compassion on you , ” says the Lord , your Redeemer .
23:54:009:0	“ Just as I swore in the time of Noahthat I would never again let a flood cover the earth , so now I swearthat I will never again be angry and punish you .
23:54:010:0	For the mountains may moveand the hills disappear , but even then my faithful love for you will remain.My covenant of blessing will never be broken , ” says the Lord , who has mercy on you .
23:54:011:0	“ O storm-battered city , troubled and desolate ! I will rebuild you with precious jewelsand make your foundations from lapis lazuli .
23:54:012:0	I will make your towers of sparkling rubies , your gates of shining gems , and your walls of precious stones .
23:54:013:0	I will teach all your children , and they will enjoy great peace .
23:54:014:0	You will be secure under a government that is just and fair.Your enemies will stay far away.You will live in peace , and terror will not come near .
23:54:015:0	If any nation comes to fight you , it is not because I sent them.Whoever attacks you will go down in defeat .
23:54:016:0	“ I have created the blacksmithwho fans the coals beneath the forgeand makes the weapons of destruction.And I have created the armies that destroy .
23:54:017:0	But in that coming dayno weapon turned against you will succeed.You will silence every voiceraised up to accuse you.These benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the Lord ; their vindication will come from me.I , the Lord , have spoken !
