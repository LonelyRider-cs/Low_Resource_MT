23:33:001:1	A Message about Assyria
23:33:001:0	What sorrow awaits you Assyrians , who have destroyed othersbut have never been destroyed yourselves.You betray others , but you have never been betrayed.When you are done destroying , you will be destroyed.When you are done betraying , you will be betrayed .
23:33:002:0	But Lord , be merciful to us , for we have waited for you.Be our strong arm each dayand our salvation in times of trouble .
23:33:003:0	The enemy runs at the sound of your voice.When you stand up , the nations flee !
23:33:004:0	Just as caterpillars and locusts strip the fields and vines , so the fallen army of Assyria will be stripped !
23:33:005:0	Though the Lord is very great and lives in heaven , he will make Jerusalem his home of justice and righteousness .
23:33:006:0	In that day he will be your sure foundation , providing a rich store of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge.The fear of the Lord will be your treasure .
23:33:007:0	But now your brave warriors weep in public.Your ambassadors of peace cry in bitter disappointment .
23:33:008:0	Your roads are deserted ; no one travels them anymore.The Assyrians have broken their peace treatyand care nothing for the promises they made before witnesses.They have no respect for anyone .
23:33:009:0	The land of Israel wilts in mourning.Lebanon withers with shame.The plain of Sharon is now a wilderness.Bashan and Carmel have been plundered .
23:33:010:0	But the Lord says : “ Now I will stand up.Now I will show my power and might .
23:33:011:0	You Assyrians produce nothing but dry grass and stubble.Your own breath will turn to fire and consume you .
23:33:012:0	Your people will be burned up completely , like thornbushes cut down and tossed in a fire .
23:33:013:0	Listen to what I have done , you nations far away ! And you that are near , acknowledge my might ! ”
23:33:014:0	The sinners in Jerusalem shake with fear.Terror seizes the godless. “ Who can live with this devouring fire ? ” they cry. “ Who can survive this all-consuming fire ? ”
23:33:015:0	Those who are honest and fair , who refuse to profit by fraud , who stay far away from bribes , who refuse to listen to those who plot murder , who shut their eyes to all enticement to do wrong—
23:33:016:0	these are the ones who will dwell on high.The rocks of the mountains will be their fortress.Food will be supplied to them , and they will have water in abundance .
23:33:017:0	Your eyes will see the king in all his splendor , and you will see a land that stretches into the distance .
23:33:018:0	You will think back to this time of terror , asking , “ Where are the Assyrian officerswho counted our towers ? Where are the bookkeeperswho recorded the plunder taken from our fallen city ? ”
23:33:019:0	You will no longer see these fierce , violent peoplewith their strange , unknown language .
23:33:020:0	Instead , you will see Zion as a place of holy festivals.You will see Jerusalem , a city quiet and secure.It will be like a tent whose ropes are tautand whose stakes are firmly fixed .
23:33:021:0	The Lord will be our Mighty One.He will be like a wide river of protectionthat no enemy can cross , that no enemy ship can sail upon .
23:33:022:0	For the Lord is our judge , our lawgiver , and our king.He will care for us and save us .
23:33:023:0	The enemies ' sails hang looseon broken masts with useless tackle.Their treasure will be divided by the people of God.Even the lame will take their share !
23:33:024:0	The people of Israel will no longer say , “ We are sick and helpless , ” for the Lord will forgive their sins .
