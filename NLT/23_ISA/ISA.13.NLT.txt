23:13:001:1	A Message about Babylon
23:13:001:0	Isaiah son of Amoz received this message concerning the destruction of Babylon :
23:13:002:0	“ Raise a signal flag on a bare hilltop.Call up an army against Babylon.Wave your hand to encourage themas they march into the palaces of the high and mighty .
23:13:003:0	I , the Lord , have dedicated these soldiers for this task.Yes , I have called mighty warriors to express my anger , and they will rejoice when I am exalted . ”
23:13:004:0	Hear the noise on the mountains ! Listen , as the vast armies march ! It is the noise and shouting of many nations.The Lord of Heaven 's Armies has called this army together .
23:13:005:0	They come from distant countries , from beyond the farthest horizons.They are the Lord 's weapons to carry out his anger.With them he will destroy the whole land .
23:13:006:0	Scream in terror , for the day of the Lord has arrived—the time for the Almighty to destroy .
23:13:007:0	Every arm is paralyzed with fear.Every heart melts ,
23:13:008:0	and people are terrified.Pangs of anguish grip them , like those of a woman in labor.They look helplessly at one another , their faces aflame with fear .
23:13:009:0	For see , the day of the Lord is coming—the terrible day of his fury and fierce anger.The land will be made desolate , and all the sinners destroyed with it .
23:13:010:0	The heavens will be black above them ; the stars will give no light.The sun will be dark when it rises , and the moon will provide no light .
23:13:011:0	“ I , the Lord , will punish the world for its eviland the wicked for their sin.I will crush the arrogance of the proudand humble the pride of the mighty .
23:13:012:0	I will make people scarcer than gold—more rare than the fine gold of Ophir .
23:13:013:0	For I will shake the heavens.The earth will move from its placewhen the Lord of Heaven 's Armies displays his wrathin the day of his fierce anger . ”
23:13:014:0	Everyone in Babylon will run about like a hunted gazelle , like sheep without a shepherd.They will try to find their own peopleand flee to their own land .
23:13:015:0	Anyone who is captured will be cut down—run through with a sword .
23:13:016:0	Their little children will be dashed to death before their eyes.Their homes will be sacked , and their wives will be raped .
23:13:017:0	“ Look , I will stir up the Medes against Babylon.They can not be tempted by silveror bribed with gold .
23:13:018:0	The attacking armies will shoot down the young men with arrows.They will have no mercy on helpless babiesand will show no compassion for children . ”
23:13:019:0	Babylon , the most glorious of kingdoms , the flower of Chaldean pride , will be devastated like Sodom and Gomorrahwhen God destroyed them .
23:13:020:0	Babylon will never be inhabited again.It will remain empty for generation after generation.Nomads will refuse to camp there , and shepherds will not bed down their sheep .
23:13:021:0	Desert animals will move into the ruined city , and the houses will be haunted by howling creatures.Owls will live among the ruins , and wild goats will go there to dance .
23:13:022:0	Hyenas will howl in its fortresses , and jackals will make dens in its luxurious palaces.Babylon 's days are numbered ; its time of destruction will soon arrive .
