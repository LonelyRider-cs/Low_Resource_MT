23:62:001:1	Isaiah 's Prayer for Jerusalem
23:62:001:0	Because I love Zion , I will not keep still.Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem , I can not remain silent.I will not stop praying for heruntil her righteousness shines like the dawn , and her salvation blazes like a burning torch .
23:62:002:0	The nations will see your righteousness.World leaders will be blinded by your glory.And you will be given a new nameby the Lord 's own mouth .
23:62:003:0	The Lord will hold you in his hand for all to see—a splendid crown in the hand of God .
23:62:004:0	Never again will you be called “ The Forsaken City ” or “ The Desolate Land. ” Your new name will be “ The City of God 's Delight ” and “ The Bride of God , ” for the Lord delights in youand will claim you as his bride .
23:62:005:0	Your children will commit themselves to you , O Jerusalem , just as a young man commits himself to his bride.Then God will rejoice over youas a bridegroom rejoices over his bride .
23:62:006:0	O Jerusalem , I have posted watchmen on your walls ; they will pray day and night , continually.Take no rest , all you who pray to the Lord .
23:62:007:0	Give the Lord no rest until he completes his work , until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth .
23:62:008:0	The Lord has sworn to Jerusalem by his own strength : “ I will never again hand you over to your enemies.Never again will foreign warriors comeand take away your grain and new wine .
23:62:009:0	You raised the grain , and you will eat it , praising the Lord.Within the courtyards of the Temple , you yourselves will drink the wine you have pressed . ”
23:62:010:0	Go out through the gates ! Prepare the highway for my people to return ! Smooth out the road ; pull out the boulders ; raise a flag for all the nations to see .
23:62:011:0	The Lord has sent this message to every land : “ Tell the people of Israel , ‘ Look , your Savior is coming.See , he brings his reward with him as he comes . ' ”
23:62:012:0	They will be called “ The Holy People ” and “ The People Redeemed by the Lord. ” And Jerusalem will be known as “ The Desirable Place ” and “ The City No Longer Forsaken . ”
