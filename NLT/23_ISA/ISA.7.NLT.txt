23:7:001:1	A Message for Ahaz
23:7:001:0	When Ahaz , son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah , was king of Judah , King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah , the king of Israel , set out to attack Jerusalem . However , they were unable to carry out their plan .
23:7:002:0	The news had come to the royal court of Judah : “ Syria is allied with Israel against us ! ” So the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear , like trees shaking in a storm .
23:7:003:0	Then the Lord said to Isaiah , “ Take your son Shear-jashub and go out to meet King Ahaz . You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool , near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed .
23:7:004:0	Tell him to stop worrying . Tell him he does n't need to fear the fierce anger of those two burned-out embers , King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah .
23:7:005:0	Yes , the kings of Syria and Israel are plotting against him , saying ,
23:7:006:0	‘ We will attack Judah and capture it for ourselves . Then we will install the son of Tabeel as Judah 's king . '
23:7:007:0	But this is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ This invasion will never happen ; it will never take place ;
23:7:008:0	for Syria is no stronger than its capital , Damascus , and Damascus is no stronger than its king , Rezin.As for Israel , within sixty-five yearsit will be crushed and completely destroyed .
23:7:002:1	The Sign of Immanuel
23:7:009:0	Israel is no stronger than its capital , Samaria , and Samaria is no stronger than its king , Pekah son of Remaliah.Unless your faith is firm , I can not make you stand firm . ”
23:7:010:0	Later , the Lord sent this message to King Ahaz :
23:7:011:0	“ Ask the Lord your God for a sign of confirmation , Ahaz . Make it as difficult as you want—as high as heaven or as deep as the place of the dead . ”
23:7:012:0	But the king refused . “ No , ” he said , “ I will not test the Lord like that . ”
23:7:013:0	Then Isaiah said , “ Listen well , you royal family of David ! Is n't it enough to exhaust human patience ? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well ?
23:7:014:0	All right then , the Lord himself will give you the sign . Look ! The virgin will conceive a child ! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel ( which means ‘ God is with us ' ) .
23:7:015:0	By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong , he will be eating yogurt and honey .
23:7:016:0	For before the child is that old , the lands of the two kings you fear so much will both be deserted .
23:7:017:0	“ Then the Lord will bring things on you , your nation , and your family unlike anything since Israel broke away from Judah . He will bring the king of Assyria upon you ! ”
23:7:018:0	In that day the Lord will whistle for the army of southern Egypt and for the army of Assyria . They will swarm around you like flies and bees .
23:7:019:0	They will come in vast hordes and settle in the fertile areas and also in the desolate valleys , caves , and thorny places .
23:7:020:0	In that day the Lord will hire a “ razor ” from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—and use it to shave off everything : your land , your crops , and your people .
23:7:021:0	In that day a farmer will be fortunate to have a cow and two sheep or goats left .
23:7:022:0	Nevertheless , there will be enough milk for everyone because so few people will be left in the land . They will eat their fill of yogurt and honey .
23:7:023:0	In that day the lush vineyards , now worth 1,000 pieces of silver , will become patches of briers and thorns .
23:7:024:0	The entire land will become a vast expanse of briers and thorns , a hunting ground overrun by wildlife .
23:7:025:0	No one will go to the fertile hillsides where the gardens once grew , for briers and thorns will cover them . Cattle , sheep , and goats will graze there .
