23:50:001:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Was your mother sent away because I divorced her ? Did I sell you as slaves to my creditors ? No , you were sold because of your sins.And your mother , too , was taken because of your sins .
23:50:002:0	Why was no one there when I came ? Why did n't anyone answer when I called ? Is it because I have no power to rescue ? No , that is not the reason ! For I can speak to the sea and make it dry up ! I can turn rivers into deserts covered with dying fish .
23:50:001:1	The
23:50:002:1	Lord
23:50:003:1	's Obedient Servant
23:50:003:0	I dress the skies in darkness , covering them with clothes of mourning . ”
23:50:004:0	The Sovereign Lord has given me his words of wisdom , so that I know how to comfort the weary.Morning by morning he wakens meand opens my understanding to his will .
23:50:005:0	The Sovereign Lord has spoken to me , and I have listened.I have not rebelled or turned away .
23:50:006:0	I offered my back to those who beat meand my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard.I did not hide my facefrom mockery and spitting .
23:50:007:0	Because the Sovereign Lord helps me , I will not be disgraced.Therefore , I have set my face like a stone , determined to do his will.And I know that I will not be put to shame .
23:50:008:0	He who gives me justice is near.Who will dare to bring charges against me now ? Where are my accusers ? Let them appear !
23:50:009:0	See , the Sovereign Lord is on my side ! Who will declare me guilty ? All my enemies will be destroyedlike old clothes that have been eaten by moths !
23:50:010:0	Who among you fears the Lordand obeys his servant ? If you are walking in darkness , without a ray of light , trust in the Lordand rely on your God .
23:50:011:0	But watch out , you who live in your own lightand warm yourselves by your own fires.This is the reward you will receive from me : You will soon fall down in great torment .
