23:5:001:1	A Song about the
23:5:002:1	Lord
23:5:003:1	's Vineyard
23:5:001:0	Now I will sing for the one I lovea song about his vineyard : My beloved had a vineyardon a rich and fertile hill .
23:5:002:0	He plowed the land , cleared its stones , and planted it with the best vines.In the middle he built a watchtowerand carved a winepress in the nearby rocks.Then he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes , but the grapes that grew were bitter .
23:5:003:0	Now , you people of Jerusalem and Judah , you judge between me and my vineyard .
23:5:004:0	What more could I have done for my vineyardthat I have not already done ? When I expected sweet grapes , why did my vineyard give me bitter grapes ?
23:5:005:0	Now let me tell youwhat I will do to my vineyard : I will tear down its hedgesand let it be destroyed.I will break down its wallsand let the animals trample it .
23:5:006:0	I will make it a wild placewhere the vines are not pruned and the ground is not hoed , a place overgrown with briers and thorns.I will command the cloudsto drop no rain on it .
23:5:004:1	Judah 's Guilt and Judgment
23:5:007:0	The nation of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies.The people of Judah are his pleasant garden.He expected a crop of justice , but instead he found oppression.He expected to find righteousness , but instead he heard cries of violence .
23:5:008:0	What sorrow for you who buy up house after house and field after field , until everyone is evicted and you live alone in the land .
23:5:009:0	But I have heard the Lord of Heaven 's Armiesswear a solemn oath : “ Many houses will stand deserted ; even beautiful mansions will be empty .
23:5:010:0	Ten acres of vineyard will not produce even six gallons of wine.Ten baskets of seed will yield only one basket of grain . ”
23:5:011:0	What sorrow for those who get up early in the morninglooking for a drink of alcoholand spend long evenings drinking wineto make themselves flaming drunk .
23:5:012:0	They furnish wine and lovely music at their grand parties — lyre and harp , tambourine and flute — but they never think about the Lordor notice what he is doing .
23:5:013:0	So my people will go into exile far awaybecause they do not know me.Those who are great and honored will starve , and the common people will die of thirst .
23:5:014:0	The grave is licking its lips in anticipation , opening its mouth wide.The great and the lowlyand all the drunken mob will be swallowed up .
23:5:015:0	Humanity will be destroyed , and people brought down ; even the arrogant will lower their eyes in humiliation .
23:5:016:0	But the Lord of Heaven 's Armies will be exalted by his justice.The holiness of God will be displayed by his righteousness .
23:5:017:0	In that day lambs will find good pastures , and fattened sheep and young goats will feed among the ruins .
23:5:018:0	What sorrow for those who drag their sins behind themwith ropes made of lies , who drag wickedness behind them like a cart !
23:5:019:0	They even mock God and say , “ Hurry up and do something ! We want to see what you can do.Let the Holy One of Israel carry out his plan , for we want to know what it is . ”
23:5:020:0	What sorrow for those who saythat evil is good and good is evil , that dark is light and light is dark , that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter .
23:5:021:0	What sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyesand think themselves so clever .
23:5:022:0	What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wineand boast about all the alcohol they can hold .
23:5:023:0	They take bribes to let the wicked go free , and they punish the innocent .
23:5:024:0	Therefore , just as fire licks up stubbleand dry grass shrivels in the flame , so their roots will rotand their flowers wither.For they have rejected the law of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies ; they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel .
23:5:025:0	That is why the Lord 's anger burns against his people , and why he has raised his fist to crush them.The mountains tremble , and the corpses of his people litter the streets like garbage.But even then the Lord 's anger is not satisfied.His fist is still poised to strike !
23:5:026:0	He will send a signal to distant nations far awayand whistle to those at the ends of the earth.They will come racing toward Jerusalem .
23:5:027:0	They will not get tired or stumble.They will not stop for rest or sleep.Not a belt will be loose , not a sandal strap broken .
23:5:028:0	Their arrows will be sharpand their bows ready for battle.Sparks will fly from their horses ' hooves , and the wheels of their chariots will spin like a whirlwind .
23:5:029:0	They will roar like lions , like the strongest of lions.Growling , they will pounce on their victims and carry them off , and no one will be there to rescue them .
23:5:030:0	They will roar over their victims on that day of destructionlike the roaring of the sea.If someone looks across the land , only darkness and distress will be seen ; even the light will be darkened by clouds .
