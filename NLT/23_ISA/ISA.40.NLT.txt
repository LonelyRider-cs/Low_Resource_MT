23:40:001:1	Comfort for God 's People
23:40:001:0	“ Comfort , comfort my people , ” says your God .
23:40:002:0	“ Speak tenderly to Jerusalem.Tell her that her sad days are goneand her sins are pardoned.Yes , the Lord has punished her twice overfor all her sins . ”
23:40:003:0	Listen ! It 's the voice of someone shouting , “ Clear the way through the wildernessfor the Lord ! Make a straight highway through the wastelandfor our God !
23:40:004:0	Fill in the valleys , and level the mountains and hills.Straighten the curves , and smooth out the rough places .
23:40:005:0	Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed , and all people will see it together.The Lord has spoken ! ”
23:40:006:0	A voice said , “ Shout ! ” I asked , “ What should I shout ? ” “ Shout that people are like the grass.Their beauty fades as quicklyas the flowers in a field .
23:40:007:0	The grass withers and the flowers fadebeneath the breath of the Lord.And so it is with people .
23:40:008:0	The grass withers and the flowers fade , but the word of our God stands forever . ”
23:40:009:0	O Zion , messenger of good news , shout from the mountaintops ! Shout it louder , O Jerusalem.Shout , and do not be afraid.Tell the towns of Judah , “ Your God is coming ! ”
23:40:010:0	Yes , the Sovereign Lord is coming in power.He will rule with a powerful arm.See , he brings his reward with him as he comes .
23:40:002:1	The
23:40:003:1	Lord
23:40:004:1	Has No Equal
23:40:011:0	He will feed his flock like a shepherd.He will carry the lambs in his arms , holding them close to his heart.He will gently lead the mother sheep with their young .
23:40:012:0	Who else has held the oceans in his hand ? Who has measured off the heavens with his fingers ? Who else knows the weight of the earthor has weighed the mountains and hills on a scale ?
23:40:013:0	Who is able to advise the Spirit of the Lord ? Who knows enough to give him advice or teach him ?
23:40:014:0	Has the Lord ever needed anyone 's advice ? Does he need instruction about what is good ? Did someone teach him what is rightor show him the path of justice ?
23:40:015:0	No , for all the nations of the worldare but a drop in the bucket.They are nothing morethan dust on the scales.He picks up the whole earthas though it were a grain of sand .
23:40:016:0	All the wood in Lebanon 's forestsand all Lebanon 's animals would not be enoughto make a burnt offering worthy of our God .
23:40:017:0	The nations of the world are worth nothing to him.In his eyes they count for less than nothing—mere emptiness and froth .
23:40:018:0	To whom can you compare God ? What image can you find to resemble him ?
23:40:019:0	Can he be compared to an idol formed in a mold , overlaid with gold , and decorated with silver chains ?
23:40:020:0	Or if people are too poor for that , they might at least choose wood that wo n't decayand a skilled craftsmanto carve an image that wo n't fall down !
23:40:021:0	Have n't you heard ? Do n't you understand ? Are you deaf to the words of God—the words he gave before the world began ? Are you so ignorant ?
23:40:022:0	God sits above the circle of the earth.The people below seem like grasshoppers to him ! He spreads out the heavens like a curtainand makes his tent from them .
23:40:023:0	He judges the great people of the worldand brings them all to nothing .
23:40:024:0	They hardly get started , barely taking root , when he blows on them and they wither.The wind carries them off like chaff .
23:40:025:0	“ To whom will you compare me ? Who is my equal ? ” asks the Holy One .
23:40:026:0	Look up into the heavens.Who created all the stars ? He brings them out like an army , one after another , calling each by its name.Because of his great power and incomparable strength , not a single one is missing .
23:40:027:0	O Jacob , how can you say the Lord does not see your troubles ? O Israel , how can you say God ignores your rights ?
23:40:028:0	Have you never heard ? Have you never understood ? The Lord is the everlasting God , the Creator of all the earth.He never grows weak or weary.No one can measure the depths of his understanding .
23:40:029:0	He gives power to the weakand strength to the powerless .
23:40:030:0	Even youths will become weak and tired , and young men will fall in exhaustion .
23:40:031:0	But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength.They will soar high on wings like eagles.They will run and not grow weary.They will walk and not faint .
