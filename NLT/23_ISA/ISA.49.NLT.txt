23:49:001:1	The
23:49:002:1	Lord
23:49:003:1	's Servant Commissioned
23:49:001:0	Listen to me , all you in distant lands ! Pay attention , you who are far away ! The Lord called me before my birth ; from within the womb he called me by name .
23:49:002:0	He made my words of judgment as sharp as a sword.He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.I am like a sharp arrow in his quiver .
23:49:003:0	He said to me , “ You are my servant , Israel , and you will bring me glory . ”
23:49:004:0	I replied , “ But my work seems so useless ! I have spent my strength for nothing and to no purpose.Yet I leave it all in the Lord 's hand ; I will trust God for my reward . ”
23:49:005:0	And now the Lord speaks — the one who formed me in my mother 's womb to be his servant , who commissioned me to bring Israel back to him.The Lord has honored me , and my God has given me strength .
23:49:006:0	He says , “ You will do more than restore the people of Israel to me.I will make you a light to the Gentiles , and you will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth . ”
23:49:004:1	Promises of Israel 's Restoration
23:49:007:0	The Lord , the Redeemerand Holy One of Israel , says to the one who is despised and rejected by the nations , to the one who is the servant of rulers : “ Kings will stand at attention when you pass by.Princes will also bow lowbecause of the Lord , the faithful one , the Holy One of Israel , who has chosen you . ”
23:49:008:0	This is what the Lord says : “ At just the right time , I will respond to you.On the day of salvation I will help you.I will protect you and give you to the peopleas my covenant with them.Through you I will reestablish the land of Israeland assign it to its own people again .
23:49:009:0	I will say to the prisoners , ‘ Come out in freedom , 'and to those in darkness , ‘ Come into the light . 'They will be my sheep , grazing in green pasturesand on hills that were previously bare .
23:49:010:0	They will neither hunger nor thirst.The searing sun will not reach them anymore.For the Lord in his mercy will lead them ; he will lead them beside cool waters .
23:49:011:0	And I will make my mountains into level paths for them.The highways will be raised above the valleys .
23:49:012:0	See , my people will return from far away , from lands to the north and west , and from as far south as Egypt . ”
23:49:013:0	Sing for joy , O heavens ! Rejoice , O earth ! Burst into song , O mountains ! For the Lord has comforted his peopleand will have compassion on them in their suffering .
23:49:014:0	Yet Jerusalem says , “ The Lord has deserted us ; the Lord has forgotten us . ”
23:49:015:0	“ Never ! Can a mother forget her nursing child ? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne ? But even if that were possible , I would not forget you !
23:49:016:0	See , I have written your name on the palms of my hands.Always in my mind is a picture of Jerusalem 's walls in ruins .
23:49:017:0	Soon your descendants will come back , and all who are trying to destroy you will go away .
23:49:018:0	Look around you and see , for all your children will come back to you.As surely as I live , ” says the Lord , “ they will be like jewels or bridal ornaments for you to display .
23:49:019:0	“ Even the most desolate parts of your abandoned landwill soon be crowded with your people.Your enemies who enslaved youwill be far away .
23:49:020:0	The generations born in exile will return and say , ‘ We need more room ! It 's crowded here ! '
23:49:021:0	Then you will think to yourself , ‘ Who has given me all these descendants ? For most of my children were killed , and the rest were carried away into exile.I was left here all alone.Where did all these people come from ? Who bore these children ? Who raised them for me ? ' ”
23:49:022:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ See , I will give a signal to the godless nations.They will carry your little sons back to you in their arms ; they will bring your daughters on their shoulders .
23:49:023:0	Kings and queens will serve youand care for all your needs.They will bow to the earth before youand lick the dust from your feet.Then you will know that I am the Lord.Those who trust in me will never be put to shame . ”
23:49:024:0	Who can snatch the plunder of war from the hands of a warrior ? Who can demand that a tyrant let his captives go ?
23:49:025:0	But the Lord says , “ The captives of warriors will be released , and the plunder of tyrants will be retrieved.For I will fight those who fight you , and I will save your children .
23:49:026:0	I will feed your enemies with their own flesh.They will be drunk with rivers of their own blood.All the world will know that I , the Lord , am your Savior and your Redeemer , the Mighty One of Israel . ”
