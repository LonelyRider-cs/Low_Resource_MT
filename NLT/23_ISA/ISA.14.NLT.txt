23:14:001:1	A Taunt for Babylon 's King
23:14:001:0	But the Lord will have mercy on the descendants of Jacob . He will choose Israel as his special people once again . He will bring them back to settle once again in their own land . And people from many different nations will come and join them there and unite with the people of Israel .
23:14:002:0	The nations of the world will help the people of Israel to return , and those who come to live in the Lord 's land will serve them . Those who captured Israel will themselves be captured , and Israel will rule over its enemies .
23:14:003:0	In that wonderful day when the Lord gives his people rest from sorrow and fear , from slavery and chains ,
23:14:004:0	you will taunt the king of Babylon . You will say , “ The mighty man has been destroyed.Yes , your insolence is ended .
23:14:005:0	For the Lord has crushed your wicked powerand broken your evil rule .
23:14:006:0	You struck the people with endless blows of rageand held the nations in your angry gripwith unrelenting tyranny .
23:14:007:0	But finally the earth is at rest and quiet.Now it can sing again !
23:14:008:0	Even the trees of the forest — the cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon — sing out this joyous song : ‘ Since you have been cut down , no one will come now to cut us down ! '
23:14:009:0	“ In the place of the dead there is excitementover your arrival.The spirits of world leaders and mighty kings long deadstand up to see you .
23:14:010:0	With one voice they all cry out , ‘ Now you are as weak as we are !
23:14:011:0	Your might and power were buried with you.The sound of the harp in your palace has ceased.Now maggots are your sheet , and worms your blanket . '
23:14:012:0	“ How you are fallen from heaven , O shining star , son of the morning ! You have been thrown down to the earth , you who destroyed the nations of the world .
23:14:013:0	For you said to yourself , ‘ I will ascend to heaven and set my throne above God 's stars.I will preside on the mountain of the godsfar away in the north .
23:14:014:0	I will climb to the highest heavensand be like the Most High . '
23:14:015:0	Instead , you will be brought down to the place of the dead , down to its lowest depths .
23:14:016:0	Everyone there will stare at you and ask , ‘ Can this be the one who shook the earthand made the kingdoms of the world tremble ?
23:14:017:0	Is this the one who destroyed the worldand made it into a wasteland ? Is this the king who demolished the world 's greatest citiesand had no mercy on his prisoners ? '
23:14:018:0	“ The kings of the nations lie in stately glory , each in his own tomb ,
23:14:019:0	but you will be thrown out of your gravelike a worthless branch.Like a corpse trampled underfoot , you will be dumped into a mass gravewith those killed in battle.You will descend to the pit .
23:14:020:0	You will not be given a proper burial , for you have destroyed your nationand slaughtered your people.The descendants of such an evil personwill never again receive honor .
23:14:021:0	Kill this man 's children ! Let them die because of their father 's sins ! They must not rise and conquer the earth , filling the world with their cities . ”
23:14:022:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ I , myself , have risen against Babylon ! I will destroy its children and its children 's children , ” says the Lord .
23:14:002:1	A Message about Assyria
23:14:023:0	“ I will make Babylon a desolate place of owls , filled with swamps and marshes.I will sweep the land with the broom of destruction.I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken ! ”
23:14:024:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies has sworn this oath : “ It will all happen as I have planned.It will be as I have decided .
23:14:025:0	I will break the Assyrians when they are in Israel ; I will trample them on my mountains.My people will no longer be their slavesnor bow down under their heavy loads .
23:14:026:0	I have a plan for the whole earth , a hand of judgment upon all the nations .
23:14:003:1	A Message about Philistia
23:14:027:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies has spoken — who can change his plans ? When his hand is raised , who can stop him ? ”
23:14:028:0	This message came to me the year King Ahaz died :
23:14:029:0	Do not rejoice , you Philistines , that the rod that struck you is broken — that the king who attacked you is dead.For from that snake a more poisonous snake will be born , a fiery serpent to destroy you !
23:14:030:0	I will feed the poor in my pasture ; the needy will lie down in peace.But as for you , I will wipe you out with famineand destroy the few who remain .
23:14:031:0	Wail at the gates ! Weep in the cities ! Melt with fear , you Philistines ! A powerful army comes like smoke from the north.Each soldier rushes forward eager to fight .
23:14:032:0	What should we tell the Philistine messengers ? Tell them , “ The Lord has built Jerusalem ; its walls will give refuge to his oppressed people . ”
