23:25:001:1	Praise for Judgment and Salvation
23:25:001:0	O Lord , I will honor and praise your name , for you are my God.You do such wonderful things ! You planned them long ago , and now you have accomplished them .
23:25:002:0	You turn mighty cities into heaps of ruins.Cities with strong walls are turned to rubble.Beautiful palaces in distant lands disappearand will never be rebuilt .
23:25:003:0	Therefore , strong nations will declare your glory ; ruthless nations will fear you .
23:25:004:0	But you are a tower of refuge to the poor , O Lord , a tower of refuge to the needy in distress.You are a refuge from the stormand a shelter from the heat.For the oppressive acts of ruthless peopleare like a storm beating against a wall ,
23:25:005:0	or like the relentless heat of the desert.But you silence the roar of foreign nations.As the shade of a cloud cools relentless heat , so the boastful songs of ruthless people are stilled .
23:25:006:0	In Jerusalem , the Lord of Heaven 's Armieswill spread a wonderful feastfor all the people of the world.It will be a delicious banquetwith clear , well-aged wine and choice meat .
23:25:007:0	There he will remove the cloud of gloom , the shadow of death that hangs over the earth .
23:25:008:0	He will swallow up death forever ! The Sovereign Lord will wipe away all tears.He will remove forever all insults and mockeryagainst his land and people.The Lord has spoken !
23:25:009:0	In that day the people will proclaim , “ This is our God ! We trusted in him , and he saved us ! This is the Lord , in whom we trusted.Let us rejoice in the salvation he brings ! ”
23:25:010:0	For the Lord 's hand of blessing will rest on Jerusalem.But Moab will be crushed.It will be like straw trampled down and left to rot .
23:25:011:0	God will push down Moab 's peopleas a swimmer pushes down water with his hands.He will end their prideand all their evil works .
23:25:012:0	The high walls of Moab will be demolished.They will be brought down to the ground , down into the dust .
