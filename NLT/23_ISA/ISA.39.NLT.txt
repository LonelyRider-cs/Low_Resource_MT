23:39:001:1	Envoys from Babylon
23:39:001:0	Soon after this , Merodach-baladan son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift . He had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick and that he had recovered .
23:39:002:0	Hezekiah was delighted with the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses — the silver , the gold , the spices , and the aromatic oils . He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries ! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them .
23:39:003:0	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him , “ What did those men want ? Where were they from ? ” Hezekiah replied , “ They came from the distant land of Babylon . ”
23:39:004:0	“ What did they see in your palace ? ” asked Isaiah. “ They saw everything , ” Hezekiah replied . “ I showed them everything I own — all my royal treasuries . ”
23:39:005:0	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to this message from the Lord of Heaven 's Armies :
23:39:006:0	‘ The time is coming when everything in your palace — all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now — will be carried off to Babylon . Nothing will be left , ' says the Lord .
23:39:007:0	‘ Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile . They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon 's king . ' ”
23:39:008:0	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ This message you have given me from the Lord is good. ” For the king was thinking , “ At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime . ”
