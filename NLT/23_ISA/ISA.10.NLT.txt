23:10:001:0	What sorrow awaits the unjust judgesand those who issue unfair laws .
23:10:002:0	They deprive the poor of justiceand deny the rights of the needy among my people.They prey on widowsand take advantage of orphans .
23:10:003:0	What will you do when I punish you , when I send disaster upon you from a distant land ? To whom will you turn for help ? Where will your treasures be safe ?
23:10:001:1	Judgment against Assyria
23:10:004:0	You will stumble along as prisonersor lie among the dead.But even then the Lord 's anger will not be satisfied.His fist is still poised to strike .
23:10:005:0	“ What sorrow awaits Assyria , the rod of my anger.I use it as a club to express my anger .
23:10:006:0	I am sending Assyria against a godless nation , against a people with whom I am angry.Assyria will plunder them , trampling them like dirt beneath its feet .
23:10:007:0	But the king of Assyria will not understand that he is my tool ; his mind does not work that way.His plan is simply to destroy , to cut down nation after nation .
23:10:008:0	He will say , ‘ Each of my princes will soon be a king .
23:10:009:0	We destroyed Calno just as we did Carchemish.Hamath fell before us as Arpad did.And we destroyed Samaria just as we did Damascus .
23:10:010:0	Yes , we have finished off many a kingdomwhose gods were greater than those in Jerusalem and Samaria .
23:10:011:0	So we will defeat Jerusalem and her gods , just as we destroyed Samaria with hers . ' ”
23:10:012:0	After the Lord has used the king of Assyria to accomplish his purposes on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem , he will turn against the king of Assyria and punish him—for he is proud and arrogant .
23:10:013:0	He boasts , “ By my own powerful arm I have done this.With my own shrewd wisdom I planned it.I have broken down the defenses of nationsand carried off their treasures.I have knocked down their kings like a bull .
23:10:014:0	I have robbed their nests of richesand gathered up kingdoms as a farmer gathers eggs.No one can even flap a wing against meor utter a peep of protest . ”
23:10:015:0	But can the ax boast greater power than the person who uses it ? Is the saw greater than the person who saws ? Can a rod strike unless a hand moves it ? Can a wooden cane walk by itself ?
23:10:016:0	Therefore , the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , will send a plague among Assyria 's proud troops , and a flaming fire will consume its glory .
23:10:017:0	The Lord , the Light of Israel , will be a fire ; the Holy One will be a flame.He will devour the thorns and briers with fire , burning up the enemy in a single night .
23:10:018:0	The Lord will consume Assyria 's glorylike a fire consumes a forest in a fruitful land ; it will waste away like sick people in a plague .
23:10:002:1	Hope for the
23:10:003:1	Lord
23:10:004:1	's People
23:10:019:0	Of all that glorious forest , only a few trees will survive—so few that a child could count them !
23:10:020:0	In that day the remnant left in Israel , the survivors in the house of Jacob , will no longer depend on allieswho seek to destroy them.But they will faithfully trust the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
23:10:021:0	A remnant will return ; yes , the remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God .
23:10:022:0	But though the people of Israel are as numerousas the sand of the seashore , only a remnant of them will return.The Lord has rightly decided to destroy his people .
23:10:023:0	Yes , the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , has already decided to destroy the entire land .
23:10:024:0	So this is what the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , says : “ O my people in Zion , do not be afraid of the Assyrians when they oppress you with rod and club as the Egyptians did long ago .
23:10:025:0	In a little while my anger against you will end , and then my anger will rise up to destroy them . ”
23:10:026:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies will lash them with his whip , as he did when Gideon triumphed over the Midianites at the rock of Oreb , or when the Lord 's staff was raised to drown the Egyptian army in the sea .
23:10:027:0	In that day the Lord will end the bondage of his people.He will break the yoke of slaveryand lift it from their shoulders .
23:10:028:0	Look , the Assyrians are now at Aiath.They are passing through Migronand are storing their equipment at Micmash .
23:10:029:0	They are crossing the passand are camping at Geba.Fear strikes the town of Ramah.All the people of Gibeah , the hometown of Saul , are running for their lives .
23:10:030:0	Scream in terror , you people of Gallim ! Shout out a warning to Laishah.Oh , poor Anathoth !
23:10:031:0	There go the people of Madmenah , all fleeing.The citizens of Gebim are trying to hide .
23:10:032:0	The enemy stops at Nob for the rest of that day.He shakes his fist at beautiful Mount Zion , the mountain of Jerusalem .
23:10:033:0	But look ! The Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , will chop down the mighty tree of Assyria with great power ! He will cut down the proud.That lofty tree will be brought down .
23:10:034:0	He will cut down the forest trees with an ax.Lebanon will fall to the Mighty One .
