23:31:001:1	The Futility of Relying on Egypt
23:31:001:0	What sorrow awaits those who look to Egypt for help , trusting their horses , chariots , and charioteersand depending on the strength of human armiesinstead of looking to the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
23:31:002:0	In his wisdom , the Lord will send great disaster ; he will not change his mind.He will rise against the wickedand against their helpers .
23:31:003:0	For these Egyptians are mere humans , not God ! Their horses are puny flesh , not mighty spirits ! When the Lord raises his fist against them , those who help will stumble , and those being helped will fall.They will all fall down and die together .
23:31:004:0	But this is what the Lord has told me : “ When a strong young lionstands growling over a sheep it has killed , it is not frightened by the shouts and noiseof a whole crowd of shepherds.In the same way , the Lord of Heaven 's Armieswill come down and fight on Mount Zion .
23:31:005:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies will hover over Jerusalemand protect it like a bird protecting its nest.He will defend and save the city ; he will pass over it and rescue it . ”
23:31:006:0	Though you are such wicked rebels , my people , come and return to the Lord .
23:31:007:0	I know the glorious day will come when each of you will throw away the gold idols and silver images your sinful hands have made .
23:31:008:0	“ The Assyrians will be destroyed , but not by the swords of men.The sword of God will strike them , and they will panic and flee.The strong young Assyrianswill be taken away as captives .
23:31:009:0	Even the strongest will quake with terror , and princes will flee when they see your battle flags , ” says the Lord , whose fire burns in Zion , whose flame blazes from Jerusalem .
