23:46:001:1	Babylon 's False Gods
23:46:001:0	Bel and Nebo , the gods of Babylon , bow as they are lowered to the ground.They are being hauled away on ox carts.The poor beasts stagger under the weight .
23:46:002:0	Both the idols and their owners are bowed down.The gods can not protect the people , and the people can not protect the gods.They go off into captivity together .
23:46:003:0	“ Listen to me , descendants of Jacob , all you who remain in Israel.I have cared for you since you were born.Yes , I carried you before you were born .
23:46:004:0	I will be your God throughout your lifetime—until your hair is white with age.I made you , and I will care for you.I will carry you along and save you .
23:46:005:0	“ To whom will you compare me ? Who is my equal ?
23:46:006:0	Some people pour out their silver and goldand hire a craftsman to make a god from it.Then they bow down and worship it !
23:46:007:0	They carry it around on their shoulders , and when they set it down , it stays there.It ca n't even move ! And when someone prays to it , there is no answer.It ca n't rescue anyone from trouble .
23:46:008:0	“ Do not forget this ! Keep it in mind ! Remember this , you guilty ones .
23:46:009:0	Remember the things I have done in the past.For I alone am God ! I am God , and there is none like me .
23:46:010:0	Only I can tell you the futurebefore it even happens.Everything I plan will come to pass , for I do whatever I wish .
23:46:011:0	I will call a swift bird of prey from the east—a leader from a distant land to come and do my bidding.I have said what I would do , and I will do it .
23:46:012:0	“ Listen to me , you stubborn peoplewho are so far from doing right .
23:46:013:0	For I am ready to set things right , not in the distant future , but right now ! I am ready to save Jerusalemand show my glory to Israel .
