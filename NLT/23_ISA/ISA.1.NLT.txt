23:1:001:1	A Message for Rebellious Judah
23:1:001:0	These are the visions that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem . He saw these visions during the years when Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah were kings of Judah .
23:1:002:0	Listen , O heavens ! Pay attention , earth ! This is what the Lord says : “ The children I raised and cared forhave rebelled against me .
23:1:003:0	Even an ox knows its owner , and a donkey recognizes its master 's care—but Israel does n't know its master.My people do n't recognize my care for them . ”
23:1:004:0	Oh , what a sinful nation they are—loaded down with a burden of guilt.They are evil people , corrupt children who have rejected the Lord.They have despised the Holy One of Israeland turned their backs on him .
23:1:005:0	Why do you continue to invite punishment ? Must you rebel forever ? Your head is injured , and your heart is sick .
23:1:006:0	You are battered from head to foot—covered with bruises , welts , and infected wounds—without any soothing ointments or bandages .
23:1:007:0	Your country lies in ruins , and your towns are burned.Foreigners plunder your fields before your eyesand destroy everything they see .
23:1:008:0	Beautiful Jerusalem stands abandonedlike a watchman 's shelter in a vineyard , like a lean-to in a cucumber field after the harvest , like a helpless city under siege .
23:1:009:0	If the Lord of Heaven 's Armieshad not spared a few of us , we would have been wiped out like Sodom , destroyed like Gomorrah .
23:1:010:0	Listen to the Lord , you leaders of “ Sodom. ” Listen to the law of our God , people of “ Gomorrah . ”
23:1:011:0	“ What makes you think I want all your sacrifices ? ” says the Lord. “ I am sick of your burnt offerings of ramsand the fat of fattened cattle.I get no pleasure from the bloodof bulls and lambs and goats .
23:1:012:0	When you come to worship me , who asked you to parade through my courts with all your ceremony ?
23:1:013:0	Stop bringing me your meaningless gifts ; the incense of your offerings disgusts me ! As for your celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbathand your special days for fasting—they are all sinful and false.I want no more of your pious meetings .
23:1:014:0	I hate your new moon celebrations and your annual festivals.They are a burden to me . I can not stand them !
23:1:015:0	When you lift up your hands in prayer , I will not look.Though you offer many prayers , I will not listen , for your hands are covered with the blood of innocent victims .
23:1:016:0	Wash yourselves and be clean ! Get your sins out of my sight.Give up your evil ways .
23:1:017:0	Learn to do good.Seek justice.Help the oppressed.Defend the cause of orphans.Fight for the rights of widows .
23:1:018:0	“ Come now , let 's settle this , ” says the Lord. “ Though your sins are like scarlet , I will make them as white as snow.Though they are red like crimson , I will make them as white as wool .
23:1:019:0	If you will only obey me , you will have plenty to eat .
23:1:002:1	Unfaithful Jerusalem
23:1:020:0	But if you turn away and refuse to listen , you will be devoured by the sword of your enemies.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
23:1:021:0	See how Jerusalem , once so faithful , has become a prostitute.Once the home of justice and righteousness , she is now filled with murderers .
23:1:022:0	Once like pure silver , you have become like worthless slag.Once so pure , you are now like watered-down wine .
23:1:023:0	Your leaders are rebels , the companions of thieves.All of them love bribesand demand payoffs , but they refuse to defend the cause of orphansor fight for the rights of widows .
23:1:024:0	Therefore , the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the Mighty One of Israel , says , “ I will take revenge on my enemiesand pay back my foes !
23:1:025:0	I will raise my fist against you.I will melt you down and skim off your slag.I will remove all your impurities .
23:1:026:0	Then I will give you good judges againand wise counselors like you used to have.Then Jerusalem will again be called the Home of Justiceand the Faithful City . ”
23:1:027:0	Zion will be restored by justice ; those who repent will be revived by righteousness .
23:1:028:0	But rebels and sinners will be completely destroyed , and those who desert the Lord will be consumed .
23:1:029:0	You will be ashamed of your idol worshipin groves of sacred oaks.You will blush because you worshipedin gardens dedicated to idols .
23:1:030:0	You will be like a great tree with withered leaves , like a garden without water .
23:1:031:0	The strongest among you will disappear like straw ; their evil deeds will be the spark that sets it on fire.They and their evil works will burn up together , and no one will be able to put out the fire .
