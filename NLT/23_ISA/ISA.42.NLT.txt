23:42:001:1	The
23:42:002:1	Lord
23:42:003:1	's Chosen Servant
23:42:001:0	“ Look at my servant , whom I strengthen.He is my chosen one , who pleases me.I have put my Spirit upon him.He will bring justice to the nations .
23:42:002:0	He will not shoutor raise his voice in public .
23:42:003:0	He will not crush the weakest reedor put out a flickering candle.He will bring justice to all who have been wronged .
23:42:004:0	He will not falter or lose heartuntil justice prevails throughout the earth.Even distant lands beyond the sea will wait for his instruction . ”
23:42:005:0	God , the Lord , created the heavens and stretched them out.He created the earth and everything in it.He gives breath to everyone , life to everyone who walks the earth.And it is he who says ,
23:42:006:0	“ I , the Lord , have called you to demonstrate my righteousness.I will take you by the hand and guard you , and I will give you to my people , Israel , as a symbol of my covenant with them.And you will be a light to guide the nations .
23:42:007:0	You will open the eyes of the blind.You will free the captives from prison , releasing those who sit in dark dungeons .
23:42:008:0	“ I am the Lord ; that is my name ! I will not give my glory to anyone else , nor share my praise with carved idols .
23:42:004:1	A Song of Praise to the
23:42:005:1	Lord
23:42:009:0	Everything I prophesied has come true , and now I will prophesy again.I will tell you the future before it happens . ”
23:42:010:0	Sing a new song to the Lord ! Sing his praises from the ends of the earth ! Sing , all you who sail the seas , all you who live in distant coastlands .
23:42:011:0	Join in the chorus , you desert towns ; let the villages of Kedar rejoice ! Let the people of Sela sing for joy ; shout praises from the mountaintops !
23:42:012:0	Let the whole world glorify the Lord ; let it sing his praise .
23:42:013:0	The Lord will march forth like a mighty hero ; he will come out like a warrior , full of fury.He will shout his battle cryand crush all his enemies .
23:42:014:0	He will say , “ I have long been silent ; yes , I have restrained myself.But now , like a woman in labor , I will cry and groan and pant .
23:42:015:0	I will level the mountains and hillsand blight all their greenery.I will turn the rivers into dry landand will dry up all the pools .
23:42:016:0	I will lead blind Israel down a new path , guiding them along an unfamiliar way.I will brighten the darkness before themand smooth out the road ahead of them.Yes , I will indeed do these things ; I will not forsake them .
23:42:006:1	Israel 's Failure to Listen and See
23:42:017:0	But those who trust in idols , who say , ‘ You are our gods , 'will be turned away in shame .
23:42:018:0	“ Listen , you who are deaf ! Look and see , you blind !
23:42:019:0	Who is as blind as my own people , my servant ? Who is as deaf as my messenger ? Who is as blind as my chosen people , the servant of the Lord ?
23:42:020:0	You see and recognize what is rightbut refuse to act on it.You hear with your ears , but you do n't really listen . ”
23:42:021:0	Because he is righteous , the Lord has exalted his glorious law .
23:42:022:0	But his own people have been robbed and plundered , enslaved , imprisoned , and trapped.They are fair game for anyoneand have no one to protect them , no one to take them back home .
23:42:023:0	Who will hear these lessons from the pastand see the ruin that awaits you in the future ?
23:42:024:0	Who allowed Israel to be robbed and hurt ? It was the Lord , against whom we sinned , for the people would not walk in his path , nor would they obey his law .
23:42:025:0	Therefore , he poured out his fury on themand destroyed them in battle.They were enveloped in flames , but they still refused to understand.They were consumed by fire , but they did not learn their lesson .
