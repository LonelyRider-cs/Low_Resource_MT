23:22:001:1	A Message about Jerusalem
23:22:001:0	This message came to me concerning Jerusalem—the Valley of Vision : What is happening ? Why is everyone running to the rooftops ?
23:22:002:0	The whole city is in a terrible uproar.What do I see in this reveling city ? Bodies are lying everywhere , killed not in battle but by famine and disease .
23:22:003:0	All your leaders have fled.They surrendered without resistance.The people tried to slip away , but they were captured , too .
23:22:004:0	That 's why I said , “ Leave me alone to weep ; do not try to comfort me.Let me cry for my peopleas I watch them being destroyed . ”
23:22:005:0	Oh , what a day of crushing defeat ! What a day of confusion and terrorbrought by the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , upon the Valley of Vision ! The walls of Jerusalem have been broken , and cries of death echo from the mountainsides .
23:22:006:0	Elamites are the archers , with their chariots and charioteers.The men of Kir hold up the shields .
23:22:007:0	Chariots fill your beautiful valleys , and charioteers storm your gates .
23:22:008:0	Judah 's defenses have been stripped away.You run to the armory for your weapons .
23:22:009:0	You inspect the breaks in the walls of Jerusalem.You store up water in the lower pool .
23:22:010:0	You survey the houses and tear some downfor stone to strengthen the walls .
23:22:011:0	Between the city walls , you build a reservoirfor water from the old pool.But you never ask for help from the One who did all this.You never considered the One who planned this long ago .
23:22:012:0	At that time the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , called you to weep and mourn.He told you to shave your heads in sorrow for your sinsand to wear clothes of burlap to show your remorse .
23:22:013:0	But instead , you dance and play ; you slaughter cattle and kill sheep.You feast on meat and drink wine.You say , “ Let 's feast and drink , for tomorrow we die ! ”
23:22:002:1	A Message for Shebna
23:22:014:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies has revealed this to me : “ Till the day you die , you will never be forgiven for this sin. ” That is the judgment of the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
23:22:015:0	This is what the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , said to me : “ Confront Shebna , the palace administrator , and give him this message :
23:22:016:0	“ Who do you think you are , and what are you doing here , building a beautiful tomb for yourself—a monument high up in the rock ?
23:22:017:0	For the Lord is about to hurl you away , mighty man.He is going to grab you ,
23:22:018:0	crumple you into a ball , and toss you away into a distant , barren land.There you will die , and your glorious chariots will be broken and useless.You are a disgrace to your master !
23:22:019:0	“ Yes , I will drive you out of office , ” says the Lord . “ I will pull you down from your high position .
23:22:020:0	And then I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah to replace you .
23:22:021:0	I will dress him in your royal robes and will give him your title and your authority . And he will be a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah .
23:22:022:0	I will give him the key to the house of David—the highest position in the royal court . When he opens doors , no one will be able to close them ; when he closes doors , no one will be able to open them .
23:22:023:0	He will bring honor to his family name , for I will drive him firmly in place like a nail in the wall .
23:22:024:0	They will give him great responsibility , and he will bring honor to even the lowliest members of his family . ”
23:22:025:0	But the Lord of Heaven 's Armies also says : “ The time will come when I will pull out the nail that seemed so firm . It will come out and fall to the ground . Everything it supports will fall with it . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
