23:59:001:1	Warnings against Sin
23:59:001:0	Listen ! The Lord 's arm is not too weak to save you , nor is his ear too deaf to hear you call .
23:59:002:0	It 's your sins that have cut you off from God.Because of your sins , he has turned awayand will not listen anymore .
23:59:003:0	Your hands are the hands of murderers , and your fingers are filthy with sin.Your lips are full of lies , and your mouth spews corruption .
23:59:004:0	No one cares about being fair and honest.The people 's lawsuits are based on lies.They conceive evil deedsand then give birth to sin .
23:59:005:0	They hatch deadly snakesand weave spiders ' webs.Whoever eats their eggs will die ; whoever cracks them will hatch a viper .
23:59:006:0	Their webs ca n't be made into clothing , and nothing they do is productive.All their activity is filled with sin , and violence is their trademark .
23:59:007:0	Their feet run to do evil , and they rush to commit murder.They think only about sinning.Misery and destruction always follow them .
23:59:008:0	They do n't know where to find peaceor what it means to be just and good.They have mapped out crooked roads , and no one who follows them knows a moment 's peace .
23:59:009:0	So there is no justice among us , and we know nothing about right living.We look for light but find only darkness.We look for bright skies but walk in gloom .
23:59:010:0	We grope like the blind along a wall , feeling our way like people without eyes.Even at brightest noontime , we stumble as though it were dark.Among the living , we are like the dead .
23:59:011:0	We growl like hungry bears ; we moan like mournful doves.We look for justice , but it never comes.We look for rescue , but it is far away from us .
23:59:012:0	For our sins are piled up before Godand testify against us.Yes , we know what sinners we are .
23:59:013:0	We know we have rebelled and have denied the Lord.We have turned our backs on our God.We know how unfair and oppressive we have been , carefully planning our deceitful lies .
23:59:014:0	Our courts oppose the righteous , and justice is nowhere to be found.Truth stumbles in the streets , and honesty has been outlawed .
23:59:015:0	Yes , truth is gone , and anyone who renounces evil is attacked.The Lord looked and was displeasedto find there was no justice .
23:59:016:0	He was amazed to see that no one intervenedto help the oppressed.So he himself stepped in to save them with his strong arm , and his justice sustained him .
23:59:017:0	He put on righteousness as his body armorand placed the helmet of salvation on his head.He clothed himself with a robe of vengeanceand wrapped himself in a cloak of divine passion .
23:59:018:0	He will repay his enemies for their evil deeds.His fury will fall on his foes.He will pay them back even to the ends of the earth .
23:59:019:0	In the west , people will respect the name of the Lord ; in the east , they will glorify him.For he will come like a raging flood tidedriven by the breath of the Lord .
23:59:020:0	“ The Redeemer will come to Jerusalemto buy back those in Israelwho have turned from their sins , ” says the Lord .
23:59:021:0	“ And this is my covenant with them , ” says the Lord . “ My Spirit will not leave them , and neither will these words I have given you . They will be on your lips and on the lips of your children and your children 's children forever . I , the Lord , have spoken !
