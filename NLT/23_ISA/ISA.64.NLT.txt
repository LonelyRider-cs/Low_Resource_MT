23:64:001:0	Oh , that you would burst from the heavens and come down ! How the mountains would quake in your presence !
23:64:002:0	As fire causes wood to burnand water to boil , your coming would make the nations tremble.Then your enemies would learn the reason for your fame !
23:64:003:0	When you came down long ago , you did awesome deeds beyond our highest expectations.And oh , how the mountains quaked !
23:64:004:0	For since the world began , no ear has heardand no eye has seen a God like you , who works for those who wait for him !
23:64:005:0	You welcome those who gladly do good , who follow godly ways.But you have been very angry with us , for we are not godly.We are constant sinners ; how can people like us be saved ?
23:64:006:0	We are all infected and impure with sin.When we display our righteous deeds , they are nothing but filthy rags.Like autumn leaves , we wither and fall , and our sins sweep us away like the wind .
23:64:007:0	Yet no one calls on your nameor pleads with you for mercy.Therefore , you have turned away from usand turned us over to our sins .
23:64:008:0	And yet , O Lord , you are our Father.We are the clay , and you are the potter.We all are formed by your hand .
23:64:009:0	Do n't be so angry with us , Lord.Please do n't remember our sins forever.Look at us , we pray , and see that we are all your people .
23:64:010:0	Your holy cities are destroyed.Zion is a wilderness ; yes , Jerusalem is a desolate ruin .
23:64:011:0	The holy and beautiful Templewhere our ancestors praised youhas been burned down , and all the things of beauty are destroyed .
23:64:012:0	After all this , Lord , must you still refuse to help us ? Will you continue to be silent and punish us ?
