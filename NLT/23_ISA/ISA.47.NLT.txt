23:47:001:1	Prediction of Babylon 's Fall
23:47:001:0	“ Come down , virgin daughter of Babylon , and sit in the dust.For your days of sitting on a throne have ended.O daughter of Babylonia , never again will you bethe lovely princess , tender and delicate .
23:47:002:0	Take heavy millstones and grind flour.Remove your veil , and strip off your robe.Expose yourself to public view .
23:47:003:0	You will be naked and burdened with shame.I will take vengeance against you without pity . ”
23:47:004:0	Our Redeemer , whose name is the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , is the Holy One of Israel .
23:47:005:0	“ O beautiful Babylon , sit now in darkness and silence.Never again will you be known as the queen of kingdoms .
23:47:006:0	For I was angry with my chosen peopleand punished them by letting them fall into your hands.But you , Babylon , showed them no mercy.You oppressed even the elderly .
23:47:007:0	You said , ‘ I will reign forever as queen of the world ! 'You did not reflect on your actionsor think about their consequences .
23:47:008:0	“ Listen to this , you pleasure-loving kingdom , living at ease and feeling secure.You say , ‘ I am the only one , and there is no other.I will never be a widow or lose my children . '
23:47:009:0	Well , both these things will come upon you in a moment : widowhood and the loss of your children.Yes , these calamities will come upon you , despite all your witchcraft and magic .
23:47:010:0	“ You felt secure in your wickedness. ‘ No one sees me , ' you said.But your ‘ wisdom ' and ‘ knowledge ' have led you astray , and you said , ‘ I am the only one , and there is no other . '
23:47:011:0	So disaster will overtake you , and you wo n't be able to charm it away.Calamity will fall upon you , and you wo n't be able to buy your way out.A catastrophe will strike you suddenly , one for which you are not prepared .
23:47:012:0	“ Now use your magical charms ! Use the spells you have worked at all these years ! Maybe they will do you some good.Maybe they can make someone afraid of you .
23:47:013:0	All the advice you receive has made you tired.Where are all your astrologers , those stargazers who make predictions each month ? Let them stand up and save you from what the future holds .
23:47:014:0	But they are like straw burning in a fire ; they can not save themselves from the flame.You will get no help from them at all ; their hearth is no place to sit for warmth .
23:47:015:0	And all your friends , those with whom you 've done business since childhood , will go their own ways , turning a deaf ear to your cries .
