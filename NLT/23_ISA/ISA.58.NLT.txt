23:58:001:1	True and False Worship
23:58:001:0	“ Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast.Shout aloud ! Do n't be timid.Tell my people Israel of their sins !
23:58:002:0	Yet they act so pious ! They come to the Temple every dayand seem delighted to learn all about me.They act like a righteous nationthat would never abandon the laws of its God.They ask me to take action on their behalf , pretending they want to be near me .
23:58:003:0	‘ We have fasted before you ! ' they say. ‘ Why are n't you impressed ? We have been very hard on ourselves , and you do n't even notice it ! ' “ I will tell you why ! ” I respond. “ It 's because you are fasting to please yourselves.Even while you fast , you keep oppressing your workers .
23:58:004:0	What good is fastingwhen you keep on fighting and quarreling ? This kind of fastingwill never get you anywhere with me .
23:58:005:0	You humble yourselvesby going through the motions of penance , bowing your headslike reeds bending in the wind.You dress in burlapand cover yourselves with ashes.Is this what you call fasting ? Do you really think this will please the Lord ?
23:58:006:0	“ No , this is the kind of fasting I want : Free those who are wrongly imprisoned ; lighten the burden of those who work for you.Let the oppressed go free , and remove the chains that bind people .
23:58:007:0	Share your food with the hungry , and give shelter to the homeless.Give clothes to those who need them , and do not hide from relatives who need your help .
23:58:008:0	“ Then your salvation will come like the dawn , and your wounds will quickly heal.Your godliness will lead you forward , and the glory of the Lord will protect you from behind .
23:58:009:0	Then when you call , the Lord will answer. ‘ Yes , I am here , ' he will quickly reply. “ Remove the heavy yoke of oppression.Stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumors !
23:58:010:0	Feed the hungry , and help those in trouble.Then your light will shine out from the darkness , and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon .
23:58:011:0	The Lord will guide you continually , giving you water when you are dryand restoring your strength.You will be like a well-watered garden , like an ever-flowing spring .
23:58:012:0	Some of you will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities.Then you will be known as a rebuilder of wallsand a restorer of homes .
23:58:013:0	“ Keep the Sabbath day holy.Do n't pursue your own interests on that day , but enjoy the Sabbathand speak of it with delight as the Lord 's holy day.Honor the Sabbath in everything you do on that day , and do n't follow your own desires or talk idly .
23:58:014:0	Then the Lord will be your delight.I will give you great honorand satisfy you with the inheritance I promised to your ancestor Jacob.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
