23:52:001:1	Deliverance for Jerusalem
23:52:001:0	Wake up , wake up , O Zion ! Clothe yourself with strength.Put on your beautiful clothes , O holy city of Jerusalem , for unclean and godless people will enter your gates no longer .
23:52:002:0	Rise from the dust , O Jerusalem.Sit in a place of honor.Remove the chains of slavery from your neck , O captive daughter of Zion .
23:52:003:0	For this is what the Lord says : “ When I sold you into exile , I received no payment.Now I can redeem youwithout having to pay for you . ”
23:52:004:0	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ Long ago my people chose to live in Egypt . Now they are oppressed by Assyria .
23:52:005:0	What is this ? ” asks the Lord . “ Why are my people enslaved again ? Those who rule them shout in exultation . My name is blasphemed all day long .
23:52:006:0	But I will reveal my name to my people , and they will come to know its power . Then at last they will recognize that I am the one who speaks to them . ”
23:52:007:0	How beautiful on the mountainsare the feet of the messenger who brings good news , the good news of peace and salvation , the news that the God of Israel reigns !
23:52:008:0	The watchmen shout and sing with joy , for before their very eyesthey see the Lord returning to Jerusalem .
23:52:009:0	Let the ruins of Jerusalem break into joyful song , for the Lord has comforted his people.He has redeemed Jerusalem .
23:52:010:0	The Lord has demonstrated his holy powerbefore the eyes of all the nations.All the ends of the earth will seethe victory of our God .
23:52:011:0	Get out ! Get out and leave your captivity , where everything you touch is unclean.Get out of there and purify yourselves , you who carry home the sacred objects of the Lord .
23:52:002:1	The
23:52:003:1	Lord
23:52:004:1	's Suffering Servant
23:52:012:0	You will not leave in a hurry , running for your lives.For the Lord will go ahead of you ; yes , the God of Israel will protect you from behind .
23:52:013:0	See , my servant will prosper ; he will be highly exalted .
23:52:014:0	But many were amazed when they saw him.His face was so disfigured he seemed hardly human , and from his appearance , one would scarcely know he was a man .
23:52:015:0	And he will startle many nations.Kings will stand speechless in his presence.For they will see what they had not been told ; they will understand what they had not heard about .
