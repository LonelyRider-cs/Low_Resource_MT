23:35:001:1	Hope for Restoration
23:35:001:0	Even the wilderness and desert will be glad in those days.The wasteland will rejoice and blossom with spring crocuses .
23:35:002:0	Yes , there will be an abundance of flowersand singing and joy ! The deserts will become as green as the mountains of Lebanon , as lovely as Mount Carmel or the plain of Sharon.There the Lord will display his glory , the splendor of our God .
23:35:003:0	With this news , strengthen those who have tired hands , and encourage those who have weak knees .
23:35:004:0	Say to those with fearful hearts , “ Be strong , and do not fear , for your God is coming to destroy your enemies.He is coming to save you . ”
23:35:005:0	And when he comes , he will open the eyes of the blindand unplug the ears of the deaf .
23:35:006:0	The lame will leap like a deer , and those who can not speak will sing for joy ! Springs will gush forth in the wilderness , and streams will water the wasteland .
23:35:007:0	The parched ground will become a pool , and springs of water will satisfy the thirsty land.Marsh grass and reeds and rushes will flourishwhere desert jackals once lived .
23:35:008:0	And a great road will go through that once deserted land.It will be named the Highway of Holiness.Evil-minded people will never travel on it.It will be only for those who walk in God 's ways ; fools will never walk there .
23:35:009:0	Lions will not lurk along its course , nor any other ferocious beasts.There will be no other dangers.Only the redeemed will walk on it .
23:35:010:0	Those who have been ransomed by the Lord will return.They will enter Jerusalem singing , crowned with everlasting joy.Sorrow and mourning will disappear , and they will be filled with joy and gladness .
