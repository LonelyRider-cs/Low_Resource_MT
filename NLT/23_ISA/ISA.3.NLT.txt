23:3:001:1	Judgment against Judah
23:3:001:0	The Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , will take away from Jerusalem and Judaheverything they depend on : every bit of breadand every drop of water ,
23:3:002:0	all their heroes and soldiers , judges and prophets , fortune-tellers and elders ,
23:3:003:0	army officers and high officials , advisers , skilled sorcerers , and astrologers .
23:3:004:0	I will make boys their leaders , and toddlers their rulers .
23:3:005:0	People will oppress each other — man against man , neighbor against neighbor.Young people will insult their elders , and vulgar people will sneer at the honorable .
23:3:006:0	In those days a man will say to his brother , “ Since you have a coat , you be our leader ! Take charge of this heap of ruins ! ”
23:3:007:0	But he will reply , “ No ! I ca n't help.I do n't have any extra food or clothes.Do n't put me in charge ! ”
23:3:008:0	For Jerusalem will stumble , and Judah will fall , because they speak out against the Lord and refuse to obey him.They provoke him to his face .
23:3:009:0	The very look on their faces gives them away.They display their sin like the people of Sodomand do n't even try to hide it.They are doomed ! They have brought destruction upon themselves .
23:3:010:0	Tell the godly that all will be well for them.They will enjoy the rich reward they have earned !
23:3:011:0	But the wicked are doomed , for they will get exactly what they deserve .
23:3:012:0	Childish leaders oppress my people , and women rule over them.O my people , your leaders mislead you ; they send you down the wrong road .
23:3:013:0	The Lord takes his place in courtand presents his case against his people .
23:3:014:0	The Lord comes forward to pronounce judgmenton the elders and rulers of his people : “ You have ruined Israel , my vineyard.Your houses are filled with things stolen from the poor .
23:3:002:1	A Warning to Jerusalem
23:3:015:0	How dare you crush my people , grinding the faces of the poor into the dust ? ” demands the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
23:3:016:0	The Lord says , “ Beautiful Zion is haughty : craning her elegant neck , flirting with her eyes , walking with dainty steps , tinkling her ankle bracelets .
23:3:017:0	So the Lord will send scabs on her head ; the Lord will make beautiful Zion bald . ”
23:3:018:0	On that day of judgmentthe Lord will strip away everything that makes her beautiful : ornaments , headbands , crescent necklaces ,
23:3:019:0	earrings , bracelets , and veils ;
23:3:020:0	scarves , ankle bracelets , sashes , perfumes , and charms ;
23:3:021:0	rings , jewels ,
23:3:022:0	party clothes , gowns , capes , and purses ;
23:3:023:0	mirrors , fine linen garments , head ornaments , and shawls .
23:3:024:0	Instead of smelling of sweet perfume , she will stink.She will wear a rope for a sash , and her elegant hair will fall out.She will wear rough burlap instead of rich robes.Shame will replace her beauty .
23:3:025:0	The men of the city will be killed with the sword , and her warriors will die in battle .
23:3:026:0	The gates of Zion will weep and mourn.The city will be like a ravaged woman , huddled on the ground .
