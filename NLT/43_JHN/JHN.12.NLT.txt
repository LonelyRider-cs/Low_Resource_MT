43:12:001:1	Jesus Anointed at Bethany
43:12:001:0	Six days before the Passover celebration began , Jesus arrived in Bethany , the home of Lazarus—the man he had raised from the dead .
43:12:002:0	A dinner was prepared in Jesus ' honor . Martha served , and Lazarus was among those who ate with him .
43:12:003:0	Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard , and she anointed Jesus ' feet with it , wiping his feet with her hair . The house was filled with the fragrance .
43:12:004:0	But Judas Iscariot , the disciple who would soon betray him , said ,
43:12:005:0	“ That perfume was worth a year 's wages . It should have been sold and the money given to the poor . ”
43:12:006:0	Not that he cared for the poor—he was a thief , and since he was in charge of the disciples ' money , he often stole some for himself .
43:12:007:0	Jesus replied , “ Leave her alone . She did this in preparation for my burial .
43:12:008:0	You will always have the poor among you , but you will not always have me . ”
43:12:009:0	When all the people heard of Jesus ' arrival , they flocked to see him and also to see Lazarus , the man Jesus had raised from the dead .
43:12:010:0	Then the leading priests decided to kill Lazarus , too ,
43:12:002:1	Jesus ' Triumphant Entry
43:12:011:0	for it was because of him that many of the people had deserted them and believed in Jesus .
43:12:012:0	The next day , the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city . A large crowd of Passover visitors
43:12:013:0	took palm branches and went down the road to meet him . They shouted , “ Praise God ! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hail to the King of Israel ! ”
43:12:014:0	Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it , fulfilling the prophecy that said :
43:12:015:0	“ Do n't be afraid , people of Jerusalem.Look , your King is coming , riding on a donkey 's colt . ”
43:12:016:0	His disciples did n't understand at the time that this was a fulfillment of prophecy . But after Jesus entered into his glory , they remembered what had happened and realized that these things had been written about him .
43:12:017:0	Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb , raising him from the dead , and they were telling others about it .
43:12:018:0	That was the reason so many went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign .
43:12:003:1	Jesus Predicts His Death
43:12:019:0	Then the Pharisees said to each other , “ There 's nothing we can do . Look , everyone has gone after him ! ”
43:12:020:0	Some Greeks who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration
43:12:021:0	paid a visit to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee . They said , “ Sir , we want to meet Jesus . ”
43:12:022:0	Philip told Andrew about it , and they went together to ask Jesus .
43:12:023:0	Jesus replied , “ Now the time has come for the Son of Man to enter into his glory .
43:12:024:0	I tell you the truth , unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies , it remains alone . But its death will produce many new kernels—a plentiful harvest of new lives .
43:12:025:0	Those who love their life in this world will lose it . Those who care nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity .
43:12:026:0	Anyone who wants to serve me must follow me , because my servants must be where I am . And the Father will honor anyone who serves me .
43:12:027:0	“ Now my soul is deeply troubled . Should I pray , ‘ Father , save me from this hour ' ? But this is the very reason I came !
43:12:028:0	Father , bring glory to your name. ” Then a voice spoke from heaven , saying , “ I have already brought glory to my name , and I will do so again . ”
43:12:029:0	When the crowd heard the voice , some thought it was thunder , while others declared an angel had spoken to him .
43:12:030:0	Then Jesus told them , “ The voice was for your benefit , not mine .
43:12:031:0	The time for judging this world has come , when Satan , the ruler of this world , will be cast out .
43:12:032:0	And when I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw everyone to myself . ”
43:12:033:0	He said this to indicate how he was going to die .
43:12:034:0	The crowd responded , “ We understood from Scripture that the Messiah would live forever . How can you say the Son of Man will die ? Just who is this Son of Man , anyway ? ”
43:12:035:0	Jesus replied , “ My light will shine for you just a little longer . Walk in the light while you can , so the darkness will not overtake you . Those who walk in the darkness can not see where they are going .
43:12:004:1	The Unbelief of the People
43:12:036:0	Put your trust in the light while there is still time ; then you will become children of the light. ” After saying these things , Jesus went away and was hidden from them .
43:12:037:0	But despite all the miraculous signs Jesus had done , most of the people still did not believe in him .
43:12:038:0	This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet had predicted : “ Lord , who has believed our message ? To whom has the Lord revealed his powerful arm ? ”
43:12:039:0	But the people could n't believe , for as Isaiah also said ,
43:12:040:0	“ The Lord has blinded their eyesand hardened their hearts—so that their eyes can not see , and their hearts can not understand , and they can not turn to meand have me heal them . ”
43:12:041:0	Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he said this , because he saw the future and spoke of the Messiah 's glory .
43:12:042:0	Many people did believe in him , however , including some of the Jewish leaders . But they would n't admit it for fear that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue .
43:12:043:0	For they loved human praise more than the praise of God .
43:12:044:0	Jesus shouted to the crowds , “ If you trust me , you are trusting not only me , but also God who sent me .
43:12:045:0	For when you see me , you are seeing the one who sent me .
43:12:046:0	I have come as a light to shine in this dark world , so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark .
43:12:047:0	I will not judge those who hear me but do n't obey me , for I have come to save the world and not to judge it .
43:12:048:0	But all who reject me and my message will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken .
43:12:049:0	I do n't speak on my own authority . The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it .
43:12:050:0	And I know his commands lead to eternal life ; so I say whatever the Father tells me to say . ”
