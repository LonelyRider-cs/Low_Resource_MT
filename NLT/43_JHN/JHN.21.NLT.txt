43:21:001:1	Epilogue : Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples
43:21:001:0	Later , Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee . This is how it happened .
43:21:002:0	Several of the disciples were there—Simon Peter , Thomas ( nicknamed the Twin ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two other disciples .
43:21:003:0	Simon Peter said , “ I 'm going fishing. ” “ We 'll come , too , ” they all said . So they went out in the boat , but they caught nothing all night .
43:21:004:0	At dawn Jesus was standing on the beach , but the disciples could n't see who he was .
43:21:005:0	He called out , “ Fellows , have you caught any fish ? ” “ No , ” they replied .
43:21:006:0	Then he said , “ Throw out your net on the right-hand side of the boat , and you 'll get some ! ” So they did , and they could n't haul in the net because there were so many fish in it .
43:21:007:0	Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It 's the Lord ! ” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put on his tunic ( for he had stripped for work ) , jumped into the water , and headed to shore .
43:21:008:0	The others stayed with the boat and pulled the loaded net to the shore , for they were only about a hundred yards from shore .
43:21:009:0	When they got there , they found breakfast waiting for them—fish cooking over a charcoal fire , and some bread .
43:21:010:0	“ Bring some of the fish you 've just caught , ” Jesus said .
43:21:011:0	So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore . There were 153 large fish , and yet the net had n't torn .
43:21:012:0	“ Now come and have some breakfast ! ” Jesus said . None of the disciples dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” They knew it was the Lord .
43:21:013:0	Then Jesus served them the bread and the fish .
43:21:014:0	This was the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead .
43:21:015:0	After breakfast Jesus asked Simon Peter , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” Peter replied , “ you know I love you. ” “ Then feed my lambs , ” Jesus told him .
43:21:016:0	Jesus repeated the question : “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” Peter said , “ you know I love you. ” “ Then take care of my sheep , ” Jesus said .
43:21:017:0	A third time he asked him , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was hurt that Jesus asked the question a third time . He said , “ Lord , you know everything . You know that I love you. ” Jesus said , “ Then feed my sheep .
43:21:018:0	“ I tell you the truth , when you were young , you were able to do as you liked ; you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go . But when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and others will dress you and take you where you do n't want to go . ”
43:21:019:0	Jesus said this to let him know by what kind of death he would glorify God . Then Jesus told him , “ Follow me . ”
43:21:020:0	Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved—the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked , “ Lord , who will betray you ? ”
43:21:021:0	Peter asked Jesus , “ What about him , Lord ? ”
43:21:022:0	Jesus replied , “ If I want him to remain alive until I return , what is that to you ? As for you , follow me . ”
43:21:023:0	So the rumor spread among the community of believers that this disciple would n't die . But that is n't what Jesus said at all . He only said , “ If I want him to remain alive until I return , what is that to you ? ”
43:21:024:0	This disciple is the one who testifies to these events and has recorded them here . And we know that his account of these things is accurate .
43:21:025:0	Jesus also did many other things . If they were all written down , I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written .
