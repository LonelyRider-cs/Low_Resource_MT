43:19:001:1	Jesus Sentenced to Death
43:19:001:0	Then Pilate had Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip .
43:19:002:0	The soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and they put a purple robe on him .
43:19:003:0	“ Hail ! King of the Jews ! ” they mocked , as they slapped him across the face .
43:19:004:0	Pilate went outside again and said to the people , “ I am going to bring him out to you now , but understand clearly that I find him not guilty . ”
43:19:005:0	Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate said , “ Look , here is the man ! ”
43:19:006:0	When they saw him , the leading priests and Temple guards began shouting , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” “ Take him yourselves and crucify him , ” Pilate said . “ I find him not guilty . ”
43:19:007:0	The Jewish leaders replied , “ By our law he ought to die because he called himself the Son of God . ”
43:19:008:0	When Pilate heard this , he was more frightened than ever .
43:19:009:0	He took Jesus back into the headquarters again and asked him , “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus gave no answer .
43:19:010:0	“ Why do n't you talk to me ? ” Pilate demanded . “ Do n't you realize that I have the power to release you or crucify you ? ”
43:19:011:0	Then Jesus said , “ You would have no power over me at all unless it were given to you from above . So the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin . ”
43:19:012:0	Then Pilate tried to release him , but the Jewish leaders shouted , “ If you release this man , you are no ‘ friend of Caesar . ' Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar . ”
43:19:013:0	When they said this , Pilate brought Jesus out to them again . Then Pilate sat down on the judgment seat on the platform that is called the Stone Pavement ( in Hebrew , Gabbatha ) .
43:19:014:0	It was now about noon on the day of preparation for the Passover . And Pilate said to the people , “ Look , here is your king ! ”
43:19:015:0	“ Away with him , ” they yelled . “ Away with him ! Crucify him ! ” “ What ? Crucify your king ? ” Pilate asked. “ We have no king but Caesar , ” the leading priests shouted back .
43:19:002:1	The Crucifixion
43:19:016:0	Then Pilate turned Jesus over to them to be crucified.So they took Jesus away .
43:19:017:0	Carrying the cross by himself , he went to the place called Place of the Skull ( in Hebrew , Golgotha ) .
43:19:018:0	There they nailed him to the cross . Two others were crucified with him , one on either side , with Jesus between them .
43:19:019:0	And Pilate posted a sign on the cross that read , “ Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews . ”
43:19:020:0	The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and the sign was written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek , so that many people could read it .
43:19:021:0	Then the leading priests objected and said to Pilate , “ Change it from ‘ The King of the Jews ' to ‘ He said , I am King of the Jews . ' ”
43:19:022:0	Pilate replied , “ No , what I have written , I have written . ”
43:19:023:0	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they divided his clothes among the four of them . They also took his robe , but it was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom .
43:19:024:0	So they said , “ Rather than tearing it apart , let 's throw dice for it. ” This fulfilled the Scripture that says , “ They divided my garments among themselves and threw dice for my clothing. ” So that is what they did .
43:19:025:0	Standing near the cross were Jesus ' mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary ( the wife of Clopas ) , and Mary Magdalene .
43:19:026:0	When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved , he said to her , “ Dear woman , here is your son . ”
43:19:003:1	The Death of Jesus
43:19:027:0	And he said to this disciple , “ Here is your mother. ” And from then on this disciple took her into his home .
43:19:028:0	Jesus knew that his mission was now finished , and to fulfill Scripture he said , “ I am thirsty . ”
43:19:029:0	A jar of sour wine was sitting there , so they soaked a sponge in it , put it on a hyssop branch , and held it up to his lips .
43:19:030:0	When Jesus had tasted it , he said , “ It is finished ! ” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
43:19:031:0	It was the day of preparation , and the Jewish leaders did n't want the bodies hanging there the next day , which was the Sabbath ( and a very special Sabbath , because it was Passover week ) . So they asked Pilate to hasten their deaths by ordering that their legs be broken . Then their bodies could be taken down .
43:19:032:0	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus .
43:19:033:0	But when they came to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead , so they did n't break his legs .
43:19:034:0	One of the soldiers , however , pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water flowed out .
43:19:035:0	( This report is from an eyewitness giving an accurate account . He speaks the truth so that you also may continue to believe . )
43:19:036:0	These things happened in fulfillment of the Scriptures that say , “ Not one of his bones will be broken , ”
43:19:004:1	The Burial of Jesus
43:19:037:0	and “ They will look on the one they pierced . ”
43:19:038:0	Afterward Joseph of Arimathea , who had been a secret disciple of Jesus ( because he feared the Jewish leaders ) , asked Pilate for permission to take down Jesus ' body . When Pilate gave permission , Joseph came and took the body away .
43:19:039:0	With him came Nicodemus , the man who had come to Jesus at night . He brought about seventy-five pounds of perfumed ointment made from myrrh and aloes .
43:19:040:0	Following Jewish burial custom , they wrapped Jesus ' body with the spices in long sheets of linen cloth .
43:19:041:0	The place of crucifixion was near a garden , where there was a new tomb , never used before .
43:19:042:0	And so , because it was the day of preparation for the Jewish Passover and since the tomb was close at hand , they laid Jesus there .
