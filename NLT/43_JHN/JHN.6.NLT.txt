43:6:001:1	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand
43:6:001:0	After this , Jesus crossed over to the far side of the Sea of Galilee , also known as the Sea of Tiberias .
43:6:002:0	A huge crowd kept following him wherever he went , because they saw his miraculous signs as he healed the sick .
43:6:003:0	Then Jesus climbed a hill and sat down with his disciples around him .
43:6:004:0	( It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration . )
43:6:005:0	Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him . Turning to Philip , he asked , “ Where can we buy bread to feed all these people ? ”
43:6:006:0	He was testing Philip , for he already knew what he was going to do .
43:6:007:0	Philip replied , “ Even if we worked for months , we would n't have enough money to feed them ! ”
43:6:008:0	Then Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , spoke up .
43:6:009:0	“ There 's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish . But what good is that with this huge crowd ? ”
43:6:010:0	“ Tell everyone to sit down , ” Jesus said . So they all sat down on the grassy slopes . ( The men alone numbered about 5,000 . )
43:6:011:0	Then Jesus took the loaves , gave thanks to God , and distributed them to the people . Afterward he did the same with the fish . And they all ate as much as they wanted .
43:6:012:0	After everyone was full , Jesus told his disciples , “ Now gather the leftovers , so that nothing is wasted . ”
43:6:013:0	So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves .
43:6:014:0	When the people saw him do this miraculous sign , they exclaimed , “ Surely , he is the Prophet we have been expecting ! ”
43:6:002:1	Jesus Walks on Water
43:6:015:0	When Jesus saw that they were ready to force him to be their king , he slipped away into the hills by himself .
43:6:016:0	That evening Jesus ' disciples went down to the shore to wait for him .
43:6:017:0	But as darkness fell and Jesus still had n't come back , they got into the boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum .
43:6:018:0	Soon a gale swept down upon them , and the sea grew very rough .
43:6:019:0	They had rowed three or four miles when suddenly they saw Jesus walking on the water toward the boat . They were terrified ,
43:6:020:0	but he called out to them , “ Do n't be afraid . I am here ! ”
43:6:003:1	Jesus , the Bread of Life
43:6:021:0	Then they were eager to let him in the boat , and immediately they arrived at their destination !
43:6:022:0	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the far shore saw that the disciples had taken the only boat , and they realized Jesus had not gone with them .
43:6:023:0	Several boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the Lord had blessed the bread and the people had eaten .
43:6:024:0	So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they got into the boats and went across to Capernaum to look for him .
43:6:025:0	They found him on the other side of the lake and asked , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
43:6:026:0	Jesus replied , “ I tell you the truth , you want to be with me because I fed you , not because you understood the miraculous signs .
43:6:027:0	But do n't be so concerned about perishable things like food . Spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the Son of Man can give you . For God the Father has given me the seal of his approval . ”
43:6:028:0	They replied , “ We want to perform God 's works , too . What should we do ? ”
43:6:029:0	Jesus told them , “ This is the only work God wants from you : Believe in the one he has sent . ”
43:6:030:0	They answered , “ Show us a miraculous sign if you want us to believe in you . What can you do ?
43:6:031:0	After all , our ancestors ate manna while they journeyed through the wilderness ! The Scriptures say , ‘ Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat . ' ”
43:6:032:0	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , Moses did n't give you bread from heaven . My Father did . And now he offers you the true bread from heaven .
43:6:033:0	The true bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43:6:034:0	“ Sir , ” they said , “ give us that bread every day . ”
43:6:035:0	Jesus replied , “ I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again . Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
43:6:036:0	But you have n't believed in me even though you have seen me .
43:6:037:0	However , those the Father has given me will come to me , and I will never reject them .
43:6:038:0	For I have come down from heaven to do the will of God who sent me , not to do my own will .
43:6:039:0	And this is the will of God , that I should not lose even one of all those he has given me , but that I should raise them up at the last day .
43:6:040:0	For it is my Father 's will that all who see his Son and believe in him should have eternal life . I will raise them up at the last day . ”
43:6:041:0	Then the people began to murmur in disagreement because he had said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven . ”
43:6:042:0	They said , “ Is n't this Jesus , the son of Joseph ? We know his father and mother . How can he say , ‘ I came down from heaven ' ? ”
43:6:043:0	But Jesus replied , “ Stop complaining about what I said .
43:6:044:0	For no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me , and at the last day I will raise them up .
43:6:045:0	As it is written in the Scriptures , ‘ They will all be taught by God . ' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me .
43:6:046:0	( Not that anyone has ever seen the Father ; only I , who was sent from God , have seen him . )
43:6:047:0	“ I tell you the truth , anyone who believes has eternal life .
43:6:048:0	Yes , I am the bread of life !
43:6:049:0	Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness , but they all died .
43:6:050:0	Anyone who eats the bread from heaven , however , will never die .
43:6:051:0	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will live forever ; and this bread , which I will offer so the world may live , is my flesh . ”
43:6:052:0	Then the people began arguing with each other about what he meant . “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ” they asked .
43:6:053:0	So Jesus said again , “ I tell you the truth , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you can not have eternal life within you .
43:6:054:0	But anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise that person at the last day .
43:6:055:0	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
43:6:056:0	Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me , and I in him .
43:6:057:0	I live because of the living Father who sent me ; in the same way , anyone who feeds on me will live because of me .
43:6:058:0	I am the true bread that came down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will not die as your ancestors did ( even though they ate the manna ) but will live forever . ”
43:6:004:1	Many Disciples Desert Jesus
43:6:059:0	He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43:6:060:0	Many of his disciples said , “ This is very hard to understand . How can anyone accept it ? ”
43:6:061:0	Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining , so he said to them , “ Does this offend you ?
43:6:062:0	Then what will you think if you see the Son of Man ascend to heaven again ?
43:6:063:0	The Spirit alone gives eternal life . Human effort accomplishes nothing . And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
43:6:064:0	But some of you do not believe me. ” ( For Jesus knew from the beginning which ones did n't believe , and he knew who would betray him . )
43:6:065:0	Then he said , “ That is why I said that people ca n't come to me unless the Father gives them to me . ”
43:6:066:0	At this point many of his disciples turned away and deserted him .
43:6:067:0	Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked , “ Are you also going to leave ? ”
43:6:068:0	Simon Peter replied , “ Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the words that give eternal life .
43:6:069:0	We believe , and we know you are the Holy One of God . ”
43:6:070:0	Then Jesus said , “ I chose the twelve of you , but one is a devil . ”
43:6:071:0	He was speaking of Judas , son of Simon Iscariot , one of the Twelve , who would later betray him .
