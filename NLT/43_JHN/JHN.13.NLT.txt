43:13:001:1	Jesus Washes His Disciples ' Feet
43:13:001:0	Before the Passover celebration , Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave this world and return to his Father . He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth , and now he loved them to the very end .
43:13:002:0	It was time for supper , and the devil had already prompted Judas , son of Simon Iscariot , to betray Jesus .
43:13:003:0	Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from God and would return to God .
43:13:004:0	So he got up from the table , took off his robe , wrapped a towel around his waist ,
43:13:005:0	and poured water into a basin . Then he began to wash the disciples ' feet , drying them with the towel he had around him .
43:13:006:0	When Jesus came to Simon Peter , Peter said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
43:13:007:0	Jesus replied , “ You do n't understand now what I am doing , but someday you will . ”
43:13:008:0	“ No , ” Peter protested , “ you will never ever wash my feet ! ” Jesus replied , “ Unless I wash you , you wo n't belong to me . ”
43:13:009:0	Simon Peter exclaimed , “ Then wash my hands and head as well , Lord , not just my feet ! ”
43:13:010:0	Jesus replied , “ A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash , except for the feet , to be entirely clean . And you disciples are clean , but not all of you . ”
43:13:011:0	For Jesus knew who would betray him . That is what he meant when he said , “ Not all of you are clean . ”
43:13:012:0	After washing their feet , he put on his robe again and sat down and asked , “ Do you understand what I was doing ?
43:13:013:0	You call me ‘ Teacher ' and ‘ Lord , ' and you are right , because that 's what I am .
43:13:014:0	And since I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you ought to wash each other 's feet .
43:13:015:0	I have given you an example to follow . Do as I have done to you .
43:13:016:0	I tell you the truth , slaves are not greater than their master . Nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message .
43:13:002:1	Jesus Predicts His Betrayal
43:13:017:0	Now that you know these things , God will bless you for doing them .
43:13:018:0	“ I am not saying these things to all of you ; I know the ones I have chosen . But this fulfills the Scripture that says , ‘ The one who eats my food has turned against me . '
43:13:019:0	I tell you this beforehand , so that when it happens you will believe that the Messiah .
43:13:020:0	I tell you the truth , anyone who welcomes my messenger is welcoming me , and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming the Father who sent me . ”
43:13:021:0	Now Jesus was deeply troubled , and he exclaimed , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will betray me ! ”
43:13:022:0	The disciples looked at each other , wondering whom he could mean .
43:13:023:0	The disciple Jesus loved was sitting next to Jesus at the table .
43:13:024:0	Simon Peter motioned to him to ask , “ Who 's he talking about ? ”
43:13:025:0	So that disciple leaned over to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
43:13:026:0	Jesus responded , “ It is the one to whom I give the bread I dip in the bowl. ” And when he had dipped it , he gave it to Judas , son of Simon Iscariot .
43:13:027:0	When Judas had eaten the bread , Satan entered into him . Then Jesus told him , “ Hurry and do what you 're going to do . ”
43:13:028:0	None of the others at the table knew what Jesus meant .
43:13:029:0	Since Judas was their treasurer , some thought Jesus was telling him to go and pay for the food or to give some money to the poor .
43:13:003:1	Jesus Predicts Peter 's Denial
43:13:030:0	So Judas left at once , going out into the night .
43:13:031:0	As soon as Judas left the room , Jesus said , “ The time has come for the Son of Man to enter into his glory , and God will be glorified because of him .
43:13:032:0	And since God receives glory because of the Son , he will give his own glory to the Son , and he will do so at once .
43:13:033:0	Dear children , I will be with you only a little longer . And as I told the Jewish leaders , you will search for me , but you ca n't come where I am going .
43:13:034:0	So now I am giving you a new commandment : Love each other . Just as I have loved you , you should love each other .
43:13:035:0	Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples . ”
43:13:036:0	Simon Peter asked , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” And Jesus replied , “ You ca n't go with me now , but you will follow me later . ”
43:13:037:0	“ But why ca n't I come now , Lord ? ” he asked . “ I 'm ready to die for you . ”
43:13:038:0	Jesus answered , “ Die for me ? I tell you the truth , Peter—before the rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will deny three times that you even know me .
