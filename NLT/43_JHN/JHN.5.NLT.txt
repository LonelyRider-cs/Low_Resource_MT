43:5:001:1	Jesus Heals a Lame Man
43:5:001:0	Afterward Jesus returned to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish holy days .
43:5:002:0	Inside the city , near the Sheep Gate , was the pool of Bethesda , with five covered porches .
43:5:003:0	Crowds of sick people—blind , lame , or paralyzed—lay on the porches .
43:5:005:0	One of the men lying there had been sick for thirty-eight years .
43:5:006:0	When Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill for a long time , he asked him , “ Would you like to get well ? ”
43:5:007:0	“ I ca n't , sir , ” the sick man said , “ for I have no one to put me into the pool when the water bubbles up . Someone else always gets there ahead of me . ”
43:5:008:0	Jesus told him , “ Stand up , pick up your mat , and walk ! ”
43:5:009:0	Instantly , the man was healed ! He rolled up his sleeping mat and began walking ! But this miracle happened on the Sabbath ,
43:5:010:0	so the Jewish leaders objected . They said to the man who was cured , “ You ca n't work on the Sabbath ! The law does n't allow you to carry that sleeping mat ! ”
43:5:011:0	But he replied , “ The man who healed me told me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk . ' ”
43:5:012:0	“ Who said such a thing as that ? ” they demanded .
43:5:013:0	The man did n't know , for Jesus had disappeared into the crowd .
43:5:014:0	But afterward Jesus found him in the Temple and told him , “ Now you are well ; so stop sinning , or something even worse may happen to you . ”
43:5:002:1	Jesus Claims to Be the Son of God
43:5:015:0	Then the man went and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had healed him .
43:5:016:0	So the Jewish leaders began harassing Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules .
43:5:017:0	But Jesus replied , “ My Father is always working , and so am I . ”
43:5:018:0	So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him . For he not only broke the Sabbath , he called God his Father , thereby making himself equal with God .
43:5:019:0	So Jesus explained , “ I tell you the truth , the Son can do nothing by himself . He does only what he sees the Father doing . Whatever the Father does , the Son also does .
43:5:020:0	For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing . In fact , the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man . Then you will truly be astonished .
43:5:021:0	For just as the Father gives life to those he raises from the dead , so the Son gives life to anyone he wants .
43:5:022:0	In addition , the Father judges no one . Instead , he has given the Son absolute authority to judge ,
43:5:023:0	so that everyone will honor the Son , just as they honor the Father . Anyone who does not honor the Son is certainly not honoring the Father who sent him .
43:5:024:0	“ I tell you the truth , those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life . They will never be condemned for their sins , but they have already passed from death into life .
43:5:025:0	“ And I assure you that the time is coming , indeed it 's here now , when the dead will hear my voice—the voice of the Son of God . And those who listen will live .
43:5:026:0	The Father has life in himself , and he has granted that same life-giving power to his Son .
43:5:027:0	And he has given him authority to judge everyone because he is the Son of Man .
43:5:028:0	Do n't be so surprised ! Indeed , the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God 's Son ,
43:5:029:0	and they will rise again . Those who have done good will rise to experience eternal life , and those who have continued in evil will rise to experience judgment .
43:5:003:1	Witnesses to Jesus
43:5:030:0	I can do nothing on my own . I judge as God tells me . Therefore , my judgment is just , because I carry out the will of the one who sent me , not my own will .
43:5:031:0	“ If I were to testify on my own behalf , my testimony would not be valid .
43:5:032:0	But someone else is also testifying about me , and I assure you that everything he says about me is true .
43:5:033:0	In fact , you sent investigators to listen to John the Baptist , and his testimony about me was true .
43:5:034:0	Of course , I have no need of human witnesses , but I say these things so you might be saved .
43:5:035:0	John was like a burning and shining lamp , and you were excited for a while about his message .
43:5:036:0	But I have a greater witness than John—my teachings and my miracles . The Father gave me these works to accomplish , and they prove that he sent me .
43:5:037:0	And the Father who sent me has testified about me himself . You have never heard his voice or seen him face to face ,
43:5:038:0	and you do not have his message in your hearts , because you do not believe me—the one he sent to you .
43:5:039:0	“ You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life . But the Scriptures point to me !
43:5:040:0	Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life .
43:5:041:0	“ Your approval means nothing to me ,
43:5:042:0	because I know you do n't have God 's love within you .
43:5:043:0	For I have come to you in my Father 's name , and you have rejected me . Yet if others come in their own name , you gladly welcome them .
43:5:044:0	No wonder you ca n't believe ! For you gladly honor each other , but you do n't care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God .
43:5:045:0	“ Yet it is n't I who will accuse you before the Father . Moses will accuse you ! Yes , Moses , in whom you put your hopes .
43:5:046:0	If you really believed Moses , you would believe me , because he wrote about me .
43:5:047:0	But since you do n't believe what he wrote , how will you believe what I say ? ”
