43:15:001:1	Jesus , the True Vine
43:15:001:0	“ I am the true grapevine , and my Father is the gardener .
43:15:002:0	He cuts off every branch of mine that does n't produce fruit , and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more .
43:15:003:0	You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you .
43:15:004:0	Remain in me , and I will remain in you . For a branch can not produce fruit if it is severed from the vine , and you can not be fruitful unless you remain in me .
43:15:005:0	“ Yes , I am the vine ; you are the branches . Those who remain in me , and I in them , will produce much fruit . For apart from me you can do nothing .
43:15:006:0	Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers . Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned .
43:15:007:0	But if you remain in me and my words remain in you , you may ask for anything you want , and it will be granted !
43:15:008:0	When you produce much fruit , you are my true disciples . This brings great glory to my Father .
43:15:009:0	“ I have loved you even as the Father has loved me . Remain in my love .
43:15:010:0	When you obey my commandments , you remain in my love , just as I obey my Father 's commandments and remain in his love .
43:15:011:0	I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy . Yes , your joy will overflow !
43:15:012:0	This is my commandment : Love each other in the same way I have loved you .
43:15:013:0	There is no greater love than to lay down one 's life for one 's friends .
43:15:014:0	You are my friends if you do what I command .
43:15:015:0	I no longer call you slaves , because a master does n't confide in his slaves . Now you are my friends , since I have told you everything the Father told me .
43:15:016:0	You did n't choose me . I chose you . I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit , so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for , using my name .
43:15:002:1	The World 's Hatred
43:15:017:0	This is my command : Love each other .
43:15:018:0	“ If the world hates you , remember that it hated me first .
43:15:019:0	The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it , but you are no longer part of the world . I chose you to come out of the world , so it hates you .
43:15:020:0	Do you remember what I told you ? ‘ A slave is not greater than the master . ' Since they persecuted me , naturally they will persecute you . And if they had listened to me , they would listen to you .
43:15:021:0	They will do all this to you because of me , for they have rejected the one who sent me .
43:15:022:0	They would not be guilty if I had not come and spoken to them . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
43:15:023:0	Anyone who hates me also hates my Father .
43:15:024:0	If I had n't done such miraculous signs among them that no one else could do , they would not be guilty . But as it is , they have seen everything I did , yet they still hate me and my Father .
43:15:025:0	This fulfills what is written in their Scriptures : ‘ They hated me without cause . '
43:15:026:0	“ But I will send you the Advocate — the Spirit of truth . He will come to you from the Father and will testify all about me .
43:15:027:0	And you must also testify about me because you have been with me from the beginning of my ministry .
