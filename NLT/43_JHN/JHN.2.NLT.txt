43:2:001:1	The Wedding at Cana
43:2:001:0	The next day there was a wedding celebration in the village of Cana in Galilee . Jesus ' mother was there ,
43:2:002:0	and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration .
43:2:003:0	The wine supply ran out during the festivities , so Jesus ' mother told him , “ They have no more wine . ”
43:2:004:0	“ Dear woman , that 's not our problem , ” Jesus replied . “ My time has not yet come . ”
43:2:005:0	But his mother told the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you . ”
43:2:006:0	Standing nearby were six stone water jars , used for Jewish ceremonial washing . Each could hold twenty to thirty gallons .
43:2:007:0	Jesus told the servants , “ Fill the jars with water. ” When the jars had been filled ,
43:2:008:0	he said , “ Now dip some out , and take it to the master of ceremonies. ” So the servants followed his instructions .
43:2:009:0	When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine , not knowing where it had come from ( though , of course , the servants knew ) , he called the bridegroom over .
43:2:010:0	“ A host always serves the best wine first , ” he said . “ Then , when everyone has had a lot to drink , he brings out the less expensive wine . But you have kept the best until now ! ”
43:2:011:0	This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was the first time Jesus revealed his glory . And his disciples believed in him .
43:2:002:1	Jesus Clears the Temple
43:2:012:0	After the wedding he went to Capernaum for a few days with his mother , his brothers , and his disciples .
43:2:013:0	It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration , so Jesus went to Jerusalem .
43:2:014:0	In the Temple area he saw merchants selling cattle , sheep , and doves for sacrifices ; he also saw dealers at tables exchanging foreign money .
43:2:015:0	Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them all out of the Temple . He drove out the sheep and cattle , scattered the money changers ' coins over the floor , and turned over their tables .
43:2:016:0	Then , going over to the people who sold doves , he told them , “ Get these things out of here . Stop turning my Father 's house into a marketplace ! ”
43:2:017:0	Then his disciples remembered this prophecy from the Scriptures : “ Passion for God 's house will consume me . ”
43:2:018:0	But the Jewish leaders demanded , “ What are you doing ? If God gave you authority to do this , show us a miraculous sign to prove it . ”
43:2:019:0	“ All right , ” Jesus replied . “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . ”
43:2:020:0	“ What ! ” they exclaimed . “ It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple , and you can rebuild it in three days ? ”
43:2:021:0	But when Jesus said “ this temple , ” he meant his own body .
43:2:003:1	Jesus and Nicodemus
43:2:022:0	After he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered he had said this , and they believed both the Scriptures and what Jesus had said .
43:2:023:0	Because of the miraculous signs Jesus did in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration , many began to trust in him .
43:2:024:0	But Jesus did n't trust them , because he knew all about people .
43:2:025:0	No one needed to tell him about human nature , for he knew what was in each person 's heart .
