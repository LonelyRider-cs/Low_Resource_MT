43:14:001:1	Jesus , the Way to the Father
43:14:001:0	“ Do n't let your hearts be troubled . Trust in God , and trust also in me .
43:14:002:0	There is more than enough room in my Father 's home . If this were not so , would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you ?
43:14:003:0	When everything is ready , I will come and get you , so that you will always be with me where I am .
43:14:004:0	And you know the way to where I am going . ”
43:14:005:0	“ No , we do n't know , Lord , ” Thomas said . “ We have no idea where you are going , so how can we know the way ? ”
43:14:006:0	Jesus told him , “ I am the way , the truth , and the life . No one can come to the Father except through me .
43:14:007:0	If you had really known me , you would know who my Father is . From now on , you do know him and have seen him ! ”
43:14:008:0	Philip said , “ Lord , show us the Father , and we will be satisfied . ”
43:14:009:0	Jesus replied , “ Have I been with you all this time , Philip , and yet you still do n't know who I am ? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father ! So why are you asking me to show him to you ?
43:14:010:0	Do n't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words I speak are not my own , but my Father who lives in me does his work through me .
43:14:011:0	Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me . Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do .
43:14:012:0	“ I tell you the truth , anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done , and even greater works , because I am going to be with the Father .
43:14:013:0	You can ask for anything in my name , and I will do it , so that the Son can bring glory to the Father .
43:14:002:1	Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit
43:14:014:0	Yes , ask me for anything in my name , and I will do it !
43:14:015:0	“ If you love me , obey my commandments .
43:14:016:0	And I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Advocate , who will never leave you .
43:14:017:0	He is the Holy Spirit , who leads into all truth . The world can not receive him , because it is n't looking for him and does n't recognize him . But you know him , because he lives with you now and later will be in you .
43:14:018:0	No , I will not abandon you as orphans — I will come to you .
43:14:019:0	Soon the world will no longer see me , but you will see me . Since I live , you also will live .
43:14:020:0	When I am raised to life again , you will know that I am in my Father , and you are in me , and I am in you .
43:14:021:0	Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me . And because they love me , my Father will love them . And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them . ”
43:14:022:0	Judas ( not Judas Iscariot , but the other disciple with that name ) said to him , “ Lord , why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large ? ”
43:14:023:0	Jesus replied , “ All who love me will do what I say . My Father will love them , and we will come and make our home with each of them .
43:14:024:0	Anyone who does n't love me will not obey me . And remember , my words are not my own . What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me .
43:14:025:0	I am telling you these things now while I am still with you .
43:14:026:0	But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative — that is , the Holy Spirit — he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you .
43:14:027:0	“ I am leaving you with a gift — peace of mind and heart . And the peace I give is a gift the world can not give . So do n't be troubled or afraid .
43:14:028:0	Remember what I told you : I am going away , but I will come back to you again . If you really loved me , you would be happy that I am going to the Father , who is greater than I am .
43:14:029:0	I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do happen , you will believe .
43:14:030:0	“ I do n't have much more time to talk to you , because the ruler of this world approaches . He has no power over me ,
43:14:031:0	but I will do what the Father requires of me , so that the world will know that I love the Father . Come , let 's be going .
