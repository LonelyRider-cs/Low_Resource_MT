43:1:001:1	Prologue : Christ , the Eternal Word
43:1:001:0	In the beginning the Word already existed.The Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43:1:002:0	He existed in the beginning with God .
43:1:003:0	God created everything through him , and nothing was created except through him .
43:1:004:0	The Word gave life to everything that was created , and his life brought light to everyone .
43:1:005:0	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness can never extinguish it .
43:1:006:0	God sent a man , John the Baptist ,
43:1:007:0	to tell about the light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony .
43:1:008:0	John himself was not the light ; he was simply a witness to tell about the light .
43:1:009:0	The one who is the true light , who gives light to everyone , was coming into the world .
43:1:010:0	He came into the very world he created , but the world did n't recognize him .
43:1:011:0	He came to his own people , and even they rejected him .
43:1:012:0	But to all who believed him and accepted him , he gave the right to become children of God .
43:1:013:0	They are reborn—not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan , but a birth that comes from God .
43:1:014:0	So the Word became human and made his home among us . He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness . And we have seen his glory , the glory of the Father 's one and only Son .
43:1:015:0	John testified about him when he shouted to the crowds , “ This is the one I was talking about when I said , ‘ Someone is coming after me who is far greater than I am , for he existed long before me . ' ”
43:1:016:0	From his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another .
43:1:017:0	For the law was given through Moses , but God 's unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ .
43:1:002:1	The Testimony of John the Baptist
43:1:018:0	No one has ever seen God . But the unique One , who is himself God , is near to the Father 's heart . He has revealed God to us .
43:1:019:0	This was John 's testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Temple assistants from Jerusalem to ask John , “ Who are you ? ”
43:1:020:0	He came right out and said , “ I am not the Messiah . ”
43:1:021:0	“ Well then , who are you ? ” they asked . “ Are you Elijah ? ” “ No , ” he replied. “ Are you the Prophet we are expecting ? ” “ No . ”
43:1:022:0	“ Then who are you ? We need an answer for those who sent us . What do you have to say about yourself ? ”
43:1:023:0	John replied in the words of the prophet Isaiah : “ I am a voice shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Clear the way for the Lord 's coming ! ' ”
43:1:024:0	Then the Pharisees who had been sent
43:1:025:0	asked him , “ If you are n't the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet , what right do you have to baptize ? ”
43:1:026:0	John told them , “ I baptize with water , but right here in the crowd is someone you do not recognize .
43:1:027:0	Though his ministry follows mine , I 'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandal . ”
43:1:003:1	Jesus , the Lamb of God
43:1:028:0	This encounter took place in Bethany , an area east of the Jordan River , where John was baptizing .
43:1:029:0	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
43:1:030:0	He is the one I was talking about when I said , ‘ A man is coming after me who is far greater than I am , for he existed long before me . '
43:1:031:0	I did not recognize him as the Messiah , but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel . ”
43:1:032:0	Then John testified , “ I saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and resting upon him .
43:1:033:0	I did n't know he was the one , but when God sent me to baptize with water , he told me , ‘ The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit . '
43:1:004:1	The First Disciples
43:1:034:0	I saw this happen to Jesus , so I testify that he is the Chosen One of God . ”
43:1:035:0	The following day John was again standing with two of his disciples .
43:1:036:0	As Jesus walked by , John looked at him and declared , “ Look ! There is the Lamb of God ! ”
43:1:037:0	When John 's two disciples heard this , they followed Jesus .
43:1:038:0	Jesus looked around and saw them following . “ What do you want ? ” he asked them.They replied , “ Rabbi ” ( which means “ Teacher ” ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
43:1:039:0	“ Come and see , ” he said . It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when they went with him to the place where he was staying , and they remained with him the rest of the day .
43:1:040:0	Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , was one of these men who heard what John said and then followed Jesus .
43:1:041:0	Andrew went to find his brother , Simon , and told him , “ We have found the Messiah ” ( which means “ Christ ” ) .
43:1:042:0	Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus . Looking intently at Simon , Jesus said , “ Your name is Simon , son of John—but you will be called Cephas ” ( which means “ Peter ” ) .
43:1:043:0	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Come , follow me . ”
43:1:044:0	Philip was from Bethsaida , Andrew and Peter 's hometown .
43:1:045:0	Philip went to look for Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the very person Moses and the prophets wrote about ! His name is Jesus , the son of Joseph from Nazareth . ”
43:1:046:0	“ Nazareth ! ” exclaimed Nathanael . “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” “ Come and see for yourself , ” Philip replied .
43:1:047:0	As they approached , Jesus said , “ Now here is a genuine son of Israel—a man of complete integrity . ”
43:1:048:0	“ How do you know about me ? ” Nathanael asked.Jesus replied , “ I could see you under the fig tree before Philip found you . ”
43:1:049:0	Then Nathanael exclaimed , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God—the King of Israel ! ”
43:1:050:0	Jesus asked him , “ Do you believe this just because I told you I had seen you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than this . ”
43:1:051:0	Then he said , “ I tell you the truth , you will all see heaven open and the angels of God going up and down on the Son of Man , the one who is the stairway between heaven and earth . ”
