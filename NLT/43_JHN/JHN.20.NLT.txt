43:20:002:0	She ran and found Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one whom Jesus loved . She said , “ They have taken the Lord 's body out of the tomb , and we do n't know where they have put him ! ”
43:20:003:0	Peter and the other disciple started out for the tomb .
43:20:004:0	They were both running , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
43:20:005:0	He stooped and looked in and saw the linen wrappings lying there , but he did n't go in .
43:20:006:0	Then Simon Peter arrived and went inside . He also noticed the linen wrappings lying there ,
43:20:007:0	while the cloth that had covered Jesus ' head was folded up and lying apart from the other wrappings .
43:20:008:0	Then the disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in , and he saw and believed —
43:20:009:0	for until then they still had n't understood the Scriptures that said Jesus must rise from the dead .

43:20:010:0	Then they went home .
43:20:011:0	Mary was standing outside the tomb crying , and as she wept , she stooped and looked in .
43:20:012:0	She saw two white-robed angels , one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of the place where the body of Jesus had been lying .
43:20:013:0	“ Dear woman , why are you crying ? ” the angels asked her. “ Because they have taken away my Lord , ” she replied , “ and I do n't know where they have put him . ”
43:20:014:0	She turned to leave and saw someone standing there . It was Jesus , but she did n't recognize him .
43:20:015:0	“ Dear woman , why are you crying ? ” Jesus asked her . “ Who are you looking for ? ” She thought he was the gardener . “ Sir , ” she said , “ if you have taken him away , tell me where you have put him , and I will go and get him . ”
43:20:016:0	“ Mary ! ” Jesus said.She turned to him and cried out , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which is Hebrew for “ Teacher ” ) .
43:20:017:0	“ Do n't cling to me , ” Jesus said , “ for I have n't yet ascended to the Father . But go find my brothers and tell them , ‘ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ' ”

43:20:019:0	That Sunday evening the disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . Suddenly , Jesus was standing there among them ! “ Peace be with you , ” he said .
43:20:020:0	As he spoke , he showed them the wounds in his hands and his side . They were filled with joy when they saw the Lord !
43:20:021:0	Again he said , “ Peace be with you . As the Father has sent me , so I am sending you . ”
43:20:022:0	Then he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .

43:20:023:0	If you forgive anyone 's sins , they are forgiven . If you do not forgive them , they are not forgiven . ”
43:20:024:0	One of the twelve disciples , Thomas ( nicknamed the Twin ) , was not with the others when Jesus came .
43:20:025:0	They told him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he replied , “ I wo n't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands , put my fingers into them , and place my hand into the wound in his side . ”
43:20:026:0	Eight days later the disciples were together again , and this time Thomas was with them . The doors were locked ; but suddenly , as before , Jesus was standing among them . “ Peace be with you , ” he said .
43:20:027:0	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and look at my hands . Put your hand into the wound in my side . Do n't be faithless any longer . Believe ! ”
43:20:028:0	“ My Lord and my God ! ” Thomas exclaimed .
43:20:005:1	Purpose of the Book
43:20:029:0	Then Jesus told him , “ You believe because you have seen me . Blessed are those who believe without seeing me . ”
43:20:030:0	The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book .
