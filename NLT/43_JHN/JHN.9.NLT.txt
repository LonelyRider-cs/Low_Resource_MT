43:9:001:1	Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind
43:9:001:0	As Jesus was walking along , he saw a man who had been blind from birth .
43:9:002:0	“ Rabbi , ” his disciples asked him , “ why was this man born blind ? Was it because of his own sins or his parents ' sins ? ”
43:9:003:0	“ It was not because of his sins or his parents ' sins , ” Jesus answered . “ This happened so the power of God could be seen in him .
43:9:004:0	We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent us . The night is coming , and then no one can work .
43:9:005:0	But while I am here in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43:9:006:0	Then he spit on the ground , made mud with the saliva , and spread the mud over the blind man 's eyes .
43:9:007:0	He told him , “ Go wash yourself in the pool of Siloam ” ( Siloam means “ sent ” ) . So the man went and washed and came back seeing !
43:9:008:0	His neighbors and others who knew him as a blind beggar asked each other , “ Is n't this the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
43:9:009:0	Some said he was , and others said , “ No , he just looks like him ! ” But the beggar kept saying , “ Yes , I am the same one ! ”
43:9:010:0	They asked , “ Who healed you ? What happened ? ”
43:9:011:0	He told them , “ The man they call Jesus made mud and spread it over my eyes and told me , ‘ Go to the pool of Siloam and wash yourself . ' So I went and washed , and now I can see ! ”
43:9:012:0	“ Where is he now ? ” they asked. “ I do n't know , ” he replied .
43:9:013:0	Then they took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees ,
43:9:014:0	because it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made the mud and healed him .
43:9:015:0	The Pharisees asked the man all about it . So he told them , “ He put the mud over my eyes , and when I washed it away , I could see ! ”
43:9:016:0	Some of the Pharisees said , “ This man Jesus is not from God , for he is working on the Sabbath. ” Others said , “ But how could an ordinary sinner do such miraculous signs ? ” So there was a deep division of opinion among them .
43:9:017:0	Then the Pharisees again questioned the man who had been blind and demanded , “ What 's your opinion about this man who healed you ? ” The man replied , “ I think he must be a prophet . ”
43:9:018:0	The Jewish leaders still refused to believe the man had been blind and could now see , so they called in his parents .
43:9:019:0	They asked them , “ Is this your son ? Was he born blind ? If so , how can he now see ? ”
43:9:020:0	His parents replied , “ We know this is our son and that he was born blind ,
43:9:021:0	but we do n't know how he can see or who healed him . Ask him . He is old enough to speak for himself . ”
43:9:022:0	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders , who had announced that anyone saying Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue .
43:9:023:0	That 's why they said , “ He is old enough . Ask him . ”
43:9:024:0	So for the second time they called in the man who had been blind and told him , “ God should get the glory for this , because we know this man Jesus is a sinner . ”
43:9:025:0	“ I do n't know whether he is a sinner , ” the man replied . “ But I know this : I was blind , and now I can see ! ”
43:9:026:0	“ But what did he do ? ” they asked . “ How did he heal you ? ”
43:9:027:0	“ Look ! ” the man exclaimed . “ I told you once . Did n't you listen ? Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples , too ? ”
43:9:028:0	Then they cursed him and said , “ You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses !
43:9:029:0	We know God spoke to Moses , but we do n't even know where this man comes from . ”
43:9:030:0	“ Why , that 's very strange ! ” the man replied . “ He healed my eyes , and yet you do n't know where he comes from ?
43:9:031:0	We know that God does n't listen to sinners , but he is ready to hear those who worship him and do his will .
43:9:032:0	Ever since the world began , no one has been able to open the eyes of someone born blind .
43:9:033:0	If this man were not from God , he could n't have done it . ”
43:9:002:1	Spiritual Blindness
43:9:034:0	“ You were born a total sinner ! ” they answered . “ Are you trying to teach us ? ” And they threw him out of the synagogue .
43:9:035:0	When Jesus heard what had happened , he found the man and asked , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43:9:036:0	The man answered , “ Who is he , sir ? I want to believe in him . ”
43:9:037:0	“ You have seen him , ” Jesus said , “ and he is speaking to you ! ”
43:9:038:0	“ Yes , Lord , I believe ! ” the man said . And he worshiped Jesus .
43:9:039:0	Then Jesus told him , “ I entered this world to render judgment — to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see that they are blind . ”
43:9:040:0	Some Pharisees who were standing nearby heard him and asked , “ Are you saying we 're blind ? ”
43:9:041:0	“ If you were blind , you would n't be guilty , ” Jesus replied . “ But you remain guilty because you claim you can see .
