43:10:001:1	The Good Shepherd and His Sheep
43:10:001:0	“ I tell you the truth , anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold , rather than going through the gate , must surely be a thief and a robber !
43:10:002:0	But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
43:10:003:0	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43:10:004:0	After he has gathered his own flock , he walks ahead of them , and they follow him because they know his voice .
43:10:005:0	They wo n't follow a stranger ; they will run from him because they do n't know his voice . ”
43:10:006:0	Those who heard Jesus use this illustration did n't understand what he meant ,
43:10:007:0	so he explained it to them : “ I tell you the truth , I am the gate for the sheep .
43:10:008:0	All who came before me were thieves and robbers . But the true sheep did not listen to them .
43:10:009:0	Yes , I am the gate . Those who come in through me will be saved . They will come and go freely and will find good pastures .
43:10:010:0	The thief 's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy . My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life .
43:10:011:0	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep .
43:10:012:0	A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming . He will abandon the sheep because they do n't belong to him and he is n't their shepherd . And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock .
43:10:013:0	The hired hand runs away because he 's working only for the money and does n't really care about the sheep .
43:10:014:0	“ I am the good shepherd ; I know my own sheep , and they know me ,
43:10:015:0	just as my Father knows me and I know the Father . So I sacrifice my life for the sheep .
43:10:016:0	I have other sheep , too , that are not in this sheepfold . I must bring them also . They will listen to my voice , and there will be one flock with one shepherd .
43:10:017:0	“ The Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again .
43:10:018:0	No one can take my life from me . I sacrifice it voluntarily . For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and also to take it up again . For this is what my Father has commanded . ”
43:10:019:0	When he said these things , the people were again divided in their opinions about him .
43:10:020:0	Some said , “ He 's demon possessed and out of his mind . Why listen to a man like that ? ”
43:10:002:1	Jesus Claims to Be the Son of God
43:10:021:0	Others said , “ This does n't sound like a man possessed by a demon ! Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ”
43:10:022:0	It was now winter , and Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of Hanukkah , the Festival of Dedication .
43:10:023:0	He was in the Temple , walking through the section known as Solomon 's Colonnade .
43:10:024:0	The people surrounded him and asked , “ How long are you going to keep us in suspense ? If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly . ”
43:10:025:0	Jesus replied , “ I have already told you , and you do n't believe me . The proof is the work I do in my Father 's name .
43:10:026:0	But you do n't believe me because you are not my sheep .
43:10:027:0	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
43:10:028:0	I give them eternal life , and they will never perish . No one can snatch them away from me ,
43:10:029:0	for my Father has given them to me , and he is more powerful than anyone else . No one can snatch them from the Father 's hand .
43:10:030:0	The Father and I are one . ”
43:10:031:0	Once again the people picked up stones to kill him .
43:10:032:0	Jesus said , “ At my Father 's direction I have done many good works . For which one are you going to stone me ? ”
43:10:033:0	They replied , “ We 're stoning you not for any good work , but for blasphemy ! You , a mere man , claim to be God . ”
43:10:034:0	Jesus replied , “ It is written in your own Scriptures that God said to certain leaders of the people , ‘ I say , you are gods ! '
43:10:035:0	And you know that the Scriptures can not be altered . So if those people who received God 's message were called ‘ gods , '
43:10:036:0	why do you call it blasphemy when I say , ‘ I am the Son of God ' ? After all , the Father set me apart and sent me into the world .
43:10:037:0	Do n't believe me unless I carry out my Father 's work .
43:10:038:0	But if I do his work , believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done , even if you do n't believe me . Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me , and I am in the Father . ”
43:10:039:0	Once again they tried to arrest him , but he got away and left them .
43:10:040:0	He went beyond the Jordan River near the place where John was first baptizing and stayed there awhile .
43:10:041:0	And many followed him . “ John did n't perform miraculous signs , ” they remarked to one another , “ but everything he said about this man has come true . ”
43:10:042:0	And many who were there believed in Jesus .
