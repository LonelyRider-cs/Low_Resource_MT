43:11:001:1	The Raising of Lazarus
43:11:001:0	A man named Lazarus was sick . He lived in Bethany with his sisters , Mary and Martha .
43:11:002:0	This is the Mary who later poured the expensive perfume on the Lord 's feet and wiped them with her hair . Her brother , Lazarus , was sick .
43:11:003:0	So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus telling him , “ Lord , your dear friend is very sick . ”
43:11:004:0	But when Jesus heard about it he said , “ Lazarus 's sickness will not end in death . No , it happened for the glory of God so that the Son of God will receive glory from this . ”
43:11:005:0	So although Jesus loved Martha , Mary , and Lazarus ,
43:11:006:0	he stayed where he was for the next two days .
43:11:007:0	Finally , he said to his disciples , “ Let 's go back to Judea . ”
43:11:008:0	But his disciples objected . “ Rabbi , ” they said , “ only a few days ago the people in Judea were trying to stone you . Are you going there again ? ”
43:11:009:0	Jesus replied , “ There are twelve hours of daylight every day . During the day people can walk safely . They can see because they have the light of this world .
43:11:010:0	But at night there is danger of stumbling because they have no light . ”
43:11:011:0	Then he said , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but now I will go and wake him up . ”
43:11:012:0	The disciples said , “ Lord , if he is sleeping , he will soon get better ! ”
43:11:013:0	They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was simply sleeping , but Jesus meant Lazarus had died .
43:11:014:0	So he told them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
43:11:015:0	And for your sakes , I 'm glad I was n't there , for now you will really believe . Come , let 's go see him . ”
43:11:016:0	Thomas , nicknamed the Twin , said to his fellow disciples , “ Let 's go , too — and die with Jesus . ”
43:11:017:0	When Jesus arrived at Bethany , he was told that Lazarus had already been in his grave for four days .
43:11:018:0	Bethany was only a few miles down the road from Jerusalem ,
43:11:019:0	and many of the people had come to console Martha and Mary in their loss .
43:11:020:0	When Martha got word that Jesus was coming , she went to meet him . But Mary stayed in the house .
43:11:021:0	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if only you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43:11:022:0	But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask . ”
43:11:023:0	Jesus told her , “ Your brother will rise again . ”
43:11:024:0	“ Yes , ” Martha said , “ he will rise when everyone else rises , at the last day . ”
43:11:025:0	Jesus told her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Anyone who believes in me will live , even after dying .
43:11:026:0	Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die . Do you believe this , Martha ? ”
43:11:027:0	“ Yes , Lord , ” she told him . “ I have always believed you are the Messiah , the Son of God , the one who has come into the world from God . ”
43:11:028:0	Then she returned to Mary . She called Mary aside from the mourners and told her , “ The Teacher is here and wants to see you . ”
43:11:029:0	So Mary immediately went to him .
43:11:030:0	Jesus had stayed outside the village , at the place where Martha met him .
43:11:031:0	When the people who were at the house consoling Mary saw her leave so hastily , they assumed she was going to Lazarus 's grave to weep . So they followed her there .
43:11:032:0	When Mary arrived and saw Jesus , she fell at his feet and said , “ Lord , if only you had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43:11:033:0	When Jesus saw her weeping and saw the other people wailing with her , a deep anger welled up within him , and he was deeply troubled .
43:11:034:0	“ Where have you put him ? ” he asked them.They told him , “ Lord , come and see . ”
43:11:035:0	Then Jesus wept .
43:11:036:0	The people who were standing nearby said , “ See how much he loved him ! ”
43:11:037:0	But some said , “ This man healed a blind man . Could n't he have kept Lazarus from dying ? ”
43:11:038:0	Jesus was still angry as he arrived at the tomb , a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance .
43:11:039:0	“ Roll the stone aside , ” Jesus told them.But Martha , the dead man 's sister , protested , “ Lord , he has been dead for four days . The smell will be terrible . ”
43:11:040:0	Jesus responded , “ Did n't I tell you that you would see God 's glory if you believe ? ”
43:11:041:0	So they rolled the stone aside . Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said , “ Father , thank you for hearing me .
43:11:042:0	You always hear me , but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here , so that they will believe you sent me . ”
43:11:043:0	Then Jesus shouted , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
43:11:002:1	The Plot to Kill Jesus
43:11:044:0	And the dead man came out , his hands and feet bound in graveclothes , his face wrapped in a headcloth . Jesus told them , “ Unwrap him and let him go ! ”
43:11:045:0	Many of the people who were with Mary believed in Jesus when they saw this happen .
43:11:046:0	But some went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43:11:047:0	Then the leading priests and Pharisees called the high council together . “ What are we going to do ? ” they asked each other . “ This man certainly performs many miraculous signs .
43:11:048:0	If we allow him to go on like this , soon everyone will believe in him . Then the Roman army will come and destroy both our Temple and our nation . ”
43:11:049:0	Caiaphas , who was high priest at that time , said , “ You do n't know what you 're talking about !
43:11:050:0	You do n't realize that it 's better for you that one man should die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed . ”
43:11:051:0	He did not say this on his own ; as high priest at that time he was led to prophesy that Jesus would die for the entire nation .
43:11:052:0	And not only for that nation , but to bring together and unite all the children of God scattered around the world .
43:11:053:0	So from that time on , the Jewish leaders began to plot Jesus ' death .
43:11:054:0	As a result , Jesus stopped his public ministry among the people and left Jerusalem . He went to a place near the wilderness , to the village of Ephraim , and stayed there with his disciples .
43:11:055:0	It was now almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration , and many people from all over the country arrived in Jerusalem several days early so they could go through the purification ceremony before Passover began .
43:11:056:0	They kept looking for Jesus , but as they stood around in the Temple , they said to each other , “ What do you think ? He wo n't come for Passover , will he ? ”
43:11:057:0	Meanwhile , the leading priests and Pharisees had publicly ordered that anyone seeing Jesus must report it immediately so they could arrest him .
