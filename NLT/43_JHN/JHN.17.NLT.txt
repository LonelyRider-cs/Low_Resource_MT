43:17:001:1	The Prayer of Jesus
43:17:001:0	After saying all these things , Jesus looked up to heaven and said , “ Father , the hour has come . Glorify your Son so he can give glory back to you .
43:17:002:0	For you have given him authority over everyone . He gives eternal life to each one you have given him .
43:17:003:0	And this is the way to have eternal life — to know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ , the one you sent to earth .
43:17:004:0	I brought glory to you here on earth by completing the work you gave me to do .
43:17:005:0	Now , Father , bring me into the glory we shared before the world began .
43:17:006:0	“ I have revealed you to the ones you gave me from this world . They were always yours . You gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
43:17:007:0	Now they know that everything I have is a gift from you ,
43:17:008:0	for I have passed on to them the message you gave me . They accepted it and know that I came from you , and they believe you sent me .
43:17:009:0	“ My prayer is not for the world , but for those you have given me , because they belong to you .
43:17:010:0	All who are mine belong to you , and you have given them to me , so they bring me glory .
43:17:011:0	Now I am departing from the world ; they are staying in this world , but I am coming to you . Holy Father , you have given me your name ; now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are .
43:17:012:0	During my time here , I protected them by the power of the name you gave me . I guarded them so that not one was lost , except the one headed for destruction , as the Scriptures foretold .
43:17:013:0	“ Now I am coming to you . I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy .
43:17:014:0	I have given them your word . And the world hates them because they do not belong to the world , just as I do not belong to the world .
43:17:015:0	I 'm not asking you to take them out of the world , but to keep them safe from the evil one .
43:17:016:0	They do not belong to this world any more than I do .
43:17:017:0	Make them holy by your truth ; teach them your word , which is truth .
43:17:018:0	Just as you sent me into the world , I am sending them into the world .
43:17:019:0	And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them so they can be made holy by your truth .
43:17:020:0	“ I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message .
43:17:021:0	I pray that they will all be one , just as you and I are one — as you are in me , Father , and I am in you . And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me .
43:17:022:0	“ I have given them the glory you gave me , so they may be one as we are one .
43:17:023:0	I am in them and you are in me . May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me .
43:17:024:0	Father , I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am . Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began !
43:17:025:0	“ O righteous Father , the world does n't know you , but I do ; and these disciples know you sent me .
43:17:026:0	I have revealed you to them , and I will continue to do so . Then your love for me will be in them , and I will be in them . ”
