43:18:001:1	Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested
43:18:001:0	After saying these things , Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples and entered a grove of olive trees .
43:18:002:0	Judas , the betrayer , knew this place , because Jesus had often gone there with his disciples .
43:18:003:0	The leading priests and Pharisees had given Judas a contingent of Roman soldiers and Temple guards to accompany him . Now with blazing torches , lanterns , and weapons , they arrived at the olive grove .
43:18:004:0	Jesus fully realized all that was going to happen to him , so he stepped forward to meet them . “ Who are you looking for ? ” he asked .
43:18:005:0	“ Jesus the Nazarene , ” they replied. “ he , ” Jesus said . ( Judas , who betrayed him , was standing with them . )
43:18:006:0	As Jesus said “ he , ” they all drew back and fell to the ground !
43:18:007:0	Once more he asked them , “ Who are you looking for ? ” And again they replied , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ”
43:18:008:0	“ I told you that he , ” Jesus said . “ And since I am the one you want , let these others go . ”
43:18:009:0	He did this to fulfill his own statement : “ I did not lose a single one of those you have given me . ”
43:18:010:0	Then Simon Peter drew a sword and slashed off the right ear of Malchus , the high priest 's slave .
43:18:002:1	Jesus at the High Priest 's House
43:18:011:0	But Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back into its sheath . Shall I not drink from the cup of suffering the Father has given me ? ”
43:18:012:0	So the soldiers , their commanding officer , and the Temple guards arrested Jesus and tied him up .
43:18:013:0	First they took him to Annas , since he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest at that time .
43:18:003:1	Peter 's First Denial
43:18:014:0	Caiaphas was the one who had told the other Jewish leaders , “ It 's better that one man should die for the people . ”
43:18:015:0	Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another of the disciples . That other disciple was acquainted with the high priest , so he was allowed to enter the high priest 's courtyard with Jesus .
43:18:016:0	Peter had to stay outside the gate . Then the disciple who knew the high priest spoke to the woman watching at the gate , and she let Peter in .
43:18:017:0	The woman asked Peter , “ You 're not one of that man 's disciples , are you ? ” “ No , ” he said , “ I am not . ”
43:18:004:1	The High Priest Questions Jesus
43:18:018:0	Because it was cold , the household servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire . They stood around it , warming themselves , and Peter stood with them , warming himself .
43:18:019:0	Inside , the high priest began asking Jesus about his followers and what he had been teaching them .
43:18:020:0	Jesus replied , “ Everyone knows what I teach . I have preached regularly in the synagogues and the Temple , where the people gather . I have not spoken in secret .
43:18:021:0	Why are you asking me this question ? Ask those who heard me . They know what I said . ”
43:18:022:0	Then one of the Temple guards standing nearby slapped Jesus across the face . “ Is that the way to answer the high priest ? ” he demanded .
43:18:023:0	Jesus replied , “ If I said anything wrong , you must prove it . But if I 'm speaking the truth , why are you beating me ? ”
43:18:005:1	Peter 's Second and Third Denials
43:18:024:0	Then Annas bound Jesus and sent him to Caiaphas , the high priest .
43:18:025:0	Meanwhile , as Simon Peter was standing by the fire warming himself , they asked him again , “ You 're not one of his disciples , are you ? ” He denied it , saying , “ No , I am not . ”
43:18:026:0	But one of the household slaves of the high priest , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , asked , “ Did n't I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus ? ”
43:18:006:1	Jesus ' Trial before Pilate
43:18:027:0	Again Peter denied it . And immediately a rooster crowed .
43:18:028:0	Jesus ' trial before Caiaphas ended in the early hours of the morning . Then he was taken to the headquarters of the Roman governor . His accusers did n't go inside because it would defile them , and they would n't be allowed to celebrate the Passover .
43:18:029:0	So Pilate , the governor , went out to them and asked , “ What is your charge against this man ? ”
43:18:030:0	“ We would n't have handed him over to you if he were n't a criminal ! ” they retorted .
43:18:031:0	“ Then take him away and judge him by your own law , ” Pilate told them. “ Only the Romans are permitted to execute someone , ” the Jewish leaders replied .
43:18:032:0	( This fulfilled Jesus ' prediction about the way he would die . )
43:18:033:0	Then Pilate went back into his headquarters and called for Jesus to be brought to him . “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” he asked him .
43:18:034:0	Jesus replied , “ Is this your own question , or did others tell you about me ? ”
43:18:035:0	“ Am I a Jew ? ” Pilate retorted . “ Your own people and their leading priests brought you to me for trial . Why ? What have you done ? ”
43:18:036:0	Jesus answered , “ My Kingdom is not an earthly kingdom . If it were , my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders . But my Kingdom is not of this world . ”
43:18:037:0	Pilate said , “ So you are a king ? ” Jesus responded , “ You say I am a king . Actually , I was born and came into the world to testify to the truth . All who love the truth recognize that what I say is true . ”
43:18:038:0	“ What is truth ? ” Pilate asked . Then he went out again to the people and told them , “ He is not guilty of any crime .
43:18:039:0	But you have a custom of asking me to release one prisoner each year at Passover . Would you like me to release this ‘ King of the Jews ' ? ”
43:18:040:0	But they shouted back , “ No ! Not this man . We want Barabbas ! ” ( Barabbas was a revolutionary . )
