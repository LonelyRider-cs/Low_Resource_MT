43:4:001:1	Jesus and the Samaritan Woman
43:4:001:0	Jesus knew the Pharisees had heard that he was baptizing and making more disciples than John
43:4:002:0	( though Jesus himself did n't baptize them—his disciples did ) .
43:4:003:0	So he left Judea and returned to Galilee .
43:4:004:0	He had to go through Samaria on the way .
43:4:005:0	Eventually he came to the Samaritan village of Sychar , near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43:4:006:0	Jacob 's well was there ; and Jesus , tired from the long walk , sat wearily beside the well about noontime .
43:4:007:0	Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water , and Jesus said to her , “ Please give me a drink . ”
43:4:008:0	He was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food .
43:4:009:0	The woman was surprised , for Jews refuse to have anything to do with Samaritans . She said to Jesus , “ You are a Jew , and I am a Samaritan woman . Why are you asking me for a drink ? ”
43:4:010:0	Jesus replied , “ If you only knew the gift God has for you and who you are speaking to , you would ask me , and I would give you living water . ”
43:4:011:0	“ But sir , you do n't have a rope or a bucket , ” she said , “ and this well is very deep . Where would you get this living water ?
43:4:012:0	And besides , do you think you 're greater than our ancestor Jacob , who gave us this well ? How can you offer better water than he and his sons and his animals enjoyed ? ”
43:4:013:0	Jesus replied , “ Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again .
43:4:014:0	But those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again . It becomes a fresh , bubbling spring within them , giving them eternal life . ”
43:4:015:0	“ Please , sir , ” the woman said , “ give me this water ! Then I 'll never be thirsty again , and I wo n't have to come here to get water . ”
43:4:016:0	“ Go and get your husband , ” Jesus told her .
43:4:017:0	“ I do n't have a husband , ” the woman replied.Jesus said , “ You 're right ! You do n't have a husband—
43:4:018:0	for you have had five husbands , and you are n't even married to the man you 're living with now . You certainly spoke the truth ! ”
43:4:019:0	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ you must be a prophet .
43:4:020:0	So tell me , why is it that you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only place of worship , while we Samaritans claim it is here at Mount Gerizim , where our ancestors worshiped ? ”
43:4:021:0	Jesus replied , “ Believe me , dear woman , the time is coming when it will no longer matter whether you worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
43:4:022:0	You Samaritans know very little about the one you worship , while we Jews know all about him , for salvation comes through the Jews .
43:4:023:0	But the time is coming—indeed it 's here now—when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth . The Father is looking for those who will worship him that way .
43:4:024:0	For God is Spirit , so those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth . ”
43:4:025:0	The woman said , “ I know the Messiah is coming—the one who is called Christ . When he comes , he will explain everything to us . ”
43:4:026:0	Then Jesus told her , “ the Messiah ! ”
43:4:027:0	Just then his disciples came back . They were shocked to find him talking to a woman , but none of them had the nerve to ask , “ What do you want with her ? ” or “ Why are you talking to her ? ”
43:4:028:0	The woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the village , telling everyone ,
43:4:029:0	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did ! Could he possibly be the Messiah ? ”
43:4:030:0	So the people came streaming from the village to see him .
43:4:031:0	Meanwhile , the disciples were urging Jesus , “ Rabbi , eat something . ”
43:4:032:0	But Jesus replied , “ I have a kind of food you know nothing about . ”
43:4:033:0	“ Did someone bring him food while we were gone ? ” the disciples asked each other .
43:4:034:0	Then Jesus explained : “ My nourishment comes from doing the will of God , who sent me , and from finishing his work .
43:4:035:0	You know the saying , ‘ Four months between planting and harvest . ' But I say , wake up and look around . The fields are already ripe for harvest .
43:4:036:0	The harvesters are paid good wages , and the fruit they harvest is people brought to eternal life . What joy awaits both the planter and the harvester alike !
43:4:037:0	You know the saying , ‘ One plants and another harvests . ' And it 's true .
43:4:002:1	Many Samaritans Believe
43:4:038:0	I sent you to harvest where you did n't plant ; others had already done the work , and now you will get to gather the harvest . ”
43:4:039:0	Many Samaritans from the village believed in Jesus because the woman had said , “ He told me everything I ever did ! ”
43:4:040:0	When they came out to see him , they begged him to stay in their village . So he stayed for two days ,
43:4:041:0	long enough for many more to hear his message and believe .

43:4:042:0	Then they said to the woman , “ Now we believe , not just because of what you told us , but because we have heard him ourselves . Now we know that he is indeed the Savior of the world . ”
43:4:043:0	At the end of the two days , Jesus went on to Galilee .
43:4:044:0	He himself had said that a prophet is not honored in his own hometown .
43:4:045:0	Yet the Galileans welcomed him , for they had been in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration and had seen everything he did there .
43:4:046:0	As he traveled through Galilee , he came to Cana , where he had turned the water into wine . There was a government official in nearby Capernaum whose son was very sick .
43:4:047:0	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went and begged Jesus to come to Capernaum to heal his son , who was about to die .
43:4:048:0	Jesus asked , “ Will you never believe in me unless you see miraculous signs and wonders ? ”
43:4:049:0	The official pleaded , “ Lord , please come now before my little boy dies . ”
43:4:050:0	Then Jesus told him , “ Go back home . Your son will live ! ” And the man believed what Jesus said and started home .
43:4:051:0	While the man was on his way , some of his servants met him with the news that his son was alive and well .
43:4:052:0	He asked them when the boy had begun to get better , and they replied , “ Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock his fever suddenly disappeared ! ”
43:4:053:0	Then the father realized that that was the very time Jesus had told him , “ Your son will live. ” And he and his entire household believed in Jesus .
43:4:054:0	This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did in Galilee after coming from Judea .
