43:8:001:1	A Woman Caught in Adultery
43:8:001:0	Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives ,
43:8:002:0	but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple . A crowd soon gathered , and he sat down and taught them .
43:8:003:0	As he was speaking , the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery . They put her in front of the crowd .
43:8:004:0	“ Teacher , ” they said to Jesus , “ this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
43:8:005:0	The law of Moses says to stone her . What do you say ? ”
43:8:006:0	They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him , but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger .
43:8:007:0	They kept demanding an answer , so he stood up again and said , “ All right , but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone ! ”
43:8:008:0	Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust .
43:8:009:0	When the accusers heard this , they slipped away one by one , beginning with the oldest , until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman .
43:8:010:0	Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman , “ Where are your accusers ? Did n't even one of them condemn you ? ”
43:8:002:1	Jesus , the Light of the World
43:8:011:0	“ No , Lord , ” she said.And Jesus said , “ Neither do I . Go and sin no more. ” -- -- -- -- --
43:8:012:0	Jesus spoke to the people once more and said , “ I am the light of the world . If you follow me , you wo n't have to walk in darkness , because you will have the light that leads to life . ”
43:8:013:0	The Pharisees replied , “ You are making those claims about yourself ! Such testimony is not valid . ”
43:8:014:0	Jesus told them , “ These claims are valid even though I make them about myself . For I know where I came from and where I am going , but you do n't know this about me .
43:8:015:0	You judge me by human standards , but I do not judge anyone .
43:8:016:0	And if I did , my judgment would be correct in every respect because I am not alone . The Father who sent me is with me .
43:8:017:0	Your own law says that if two people agree about something , their witness is accepted as fact .
43:8:018:0	I am one witness , and my Father who sent me is the other . ”
43:8:019:0	“ Where is your father ? ” they asked.Jesus answered , “ Since you do n't know who I am , you do n't know who my Father is . If you knew me , you would also know my Father . ”
43:8:003:1	The Unbelieving People Warned
43:8:020:0	Jesus made these statements while he was teaching in the section of the Temple known as the Treasury . But he was not arrested , because his time had not yet come .
43:8:021:0	Later Jesus said to them again , “ I am going away . You will search for me but will die in your sin . You can not come where I am going . ”
43:8:022:0	The people asked , “ Is he planning to commit suicide ? What does he mean , ‘ You can not come where I am going ' ? ”
43:8:023:0	Jesus continued , “ You are from below ; I am from above . You belong to this world ; I do not .
43:8:024:0	That is why I said that you will die in your sins ; for unless you believe that who I claim to be , you will die in your sins . ”
43:8:025:0	“ Who are you ? ” they demanded.Jesus replied , “ The one I have always claimed to be .
43:8:026:0	I have much to say about you and much to condemn , but I wo n't . For I say only what I have heard from the one who sent me , and he is completely truthful . ”
43:8:027:0	But they still did n't understand that he was talking about his Father .
43:8:028:0	So Jesus said , “ When you have lifted up the Son of Man on the cross , then you will understand that he . I do nothing on my own but say only what the Father taught me .
43:8:029:0	And the one who sent me is with me — he has not deserted me . For I always do what pleases him . ”
43:8:004:1	Jesus and Abraham
43:8:030:0	Then many who heard him say these things believed in him .
43:8:031:0	Jesus said to the people who believed in him , “ You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings .
43:8:032:0	And you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
43:8:033:0	“ But we are descendants of Abraham , ” they said . “ We have never been slaves to anyone . What do you mean , ‘ You will be set free ' ? ”
43:8:034:0	Jesus replied , “ I tell you the truth , everyone who sins is a slave of sin .
43:8:035:0	A slave is not a permanent member of the family , but a son is part of the family forever .
43:8:036:0	So if the Son sets you free , you are truly free .
43:8:037:0	Yes , I realize that you are descendants of Abraham . And yet some of you are trying to kill me because there 's no room in your hearts for my message .
43:8:038:0	I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father . But you are following the advice of your father . ”
43:8:039:0	“ Our father is Abraham ! ” they declared. “ No , ” Jesus replied , “ for if you were really the children of Abraham , you would follow his example .
43:8:040:0	Instead , you are trying to kill me because I told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham never did such a thing .
43:8:041:0	No , you are imitating your real father. ” They replied , “ We are n't illegitimate children ! God himself is our true Father . ”
43:8:042:0	Jesus told them , “ If God were your Father , you would love me , because I have come to you from God . I am not here on my own , but he sent me .
43:8:043:0	Why ca n't you understand what I am saying ? It 's because you ca n't even hear me !
43:8:044:0	For you are the children of your father the devil , and you love to do the evil things he does . He was a murderer from the beginning . He has always hated the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he lies , it is consistent with his character ; for he is a liar and the father of lies .
43:8:045:0	So when I tell the truth , you just naturally do n't believe me !
43:8:046:0	Which of you can truthfully accuse me of sin ? And since I am telling you the truth , why do n't you believe me ?
43:8:047:0	Anyone who belongs to God listens gladly to the words of God . But you do n't listen because you do n't belong to God . ”
43:8:048:0	The people retorted , “ You Samaritan devil ! Did n't we say all along that you were possessed by a demon ? ”
43:8:049:0	“ No , ” Jesus said , “ I have no demon in me . For I honor my Father — and you dishonor me .
43:8:050:0	And though I have no wish to glorify myself , God is going to glorify me . He is the true judge .
43:8:051:0	I tell you the truth , anyone who obeys my teaching will never die ! ”
43:8:052:0	The people said , “ Now we know you are possessed by a demon . Even Abraham and the prophets died , but you say , ‘ Anyone who obeys my teaching will never die ! '
43:8:053:0	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? ”
43:8:054:0	Jesus answered , “ If I want glory for myself , it does n't count . But it is my Father who will glorify me . You say , ‘ He is our God , '
43:8:055:0	but you do n't even know him . I know him . If I said otherwise , I would be as great a liar as you ! But I do know him and obey him .
43:8:056:0	Your father Abraham rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming . He saw it and was glad . ”
43:8:057:0	The people said , “ You are n't even fifty years old . How can you say you have seen Abraham ? ”
43:8:058:0	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the truth , before Abraham was even born , ! ”
43:8:059:0	At that point they picked up stones to throw at him . But Jesus was hidden from them and left the Temple .
