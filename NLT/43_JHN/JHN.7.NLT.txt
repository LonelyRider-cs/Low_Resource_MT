43:7:001:1	Jesus and His Brothers
43:7:001:0	After this , Jesus traveled around Galilee . He wanted to stay out of Judea , where the Jewish leaders were plotting his death .
43:7:002:0	But soon it was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters ,
43:7:003:0	and Jesus ' brothers said to him , “ Leave here and go to Judea , where your followers can see your miracles !
43:7:004:0	You ca n't become famous if you hide like this ! If you can do such wonderful things , show yourself to the world ! ”
43:7:005:0	For even his brothers did n't believe in him .
43:7:006:0	Jesus replied , “ Now is not the right time for me to go , but you can go anytime .
43:7:007:0	The world ca n't hate you , but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil .
43:7:008:0	You go on . I 'm not going to this festival , because my time has not yet come . ”
43:7:002:1	Jesus Teaches Openly at the Temple
43:7:009:0	After saying these things , Jesus remained in Galilee .
43:7:010:0	But after his brothers left for the festival , Jesus also went , though secretly , staying out of public view .
43:7:011:0	The Jewish leaders tried to find him at the festival and kept asking if anyone had seen him .
43:7:012:0	There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds . Some argued , “ He 's a good man , ” but others said , “ He 's nothing but a fraud who deceives the people . ”
43:7:013:0	But no one had the courage to speak favorably about him in public , for they were afraid of getting in trouble with the Jewish leaders .
43:7:014:0	Then , midway through the festival , Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach .
43:7:015:0	The people were surprised when they heard him . “ How does he know so much when he has n't been trained ? ” they asked .
43:7:016:0	So Jesus told them , “ My message is not my own ; it comes from God who sent me .
43:7:017:0	Anyone who wants to do the will of God will know whether my teaching is from God or is merely my own .
43:7:018:0	Those who speak for themselves want glory only for themselves , but a person who seeks to honor the one who sent him speaks truth , not lies .
43:7:019:0	Moses gave you the law , but none of you obeys it ! In fact , you are trying to kill me . ”
43:7:020:0	The crowd replied , “ You 're demon possessed ! Who 's trying to kill you ? ”
43:7:021:0	Jesus replied , “ I did one miracle on the Sabbath , and you were amazed .
43:7:022:0	But you work on the Sabbath , too , when you obey Moses ' law of circumcision . ( Actually , this tradition of circumcision began with the patriarchs , long before the law of Moses . )
43:7:023:0	For if the correct time for circumcising your son falls on the Sabbath , you go ahead and do it so as not to break the law of Moses . So why should you be angry with me for healing a man on the Sabbath ?
43:7:003:1	Is Jesus the Messiah ?
43:7:024:0	Look beneath the surface so you can judge correctly . ”
43:7:025:0	Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem started to ask each other , “ Is n't this the man they are trying to kill ?
43:7:026:0	But here he is , speaking in public , and they say nothing to him . Could our leaders possibly believe that he is the Messiah ?
43:7:027:0	But how could he be ? For we know where this man comes from . When the Messiah comes , he will simply appear ; no one will know where he comes from . ”
43:7:028:0	While Jesus was teaching in the Temple , he called out , “ Yes , you know me , and you know where I come from . But I 'm not here on my own . The one who sent me is true , and you do n't know him .
43:7:029:0	But I know him because I come from him , and he sent me to you . ”
43:7:030:0	Then the leaders tried to arrest him ; but no one laid a hand on him , because his time had not yet come .
43:7:031:0	Many among the crowds at the Temple believed in him . “ After all , ” they said , “ would you expect the Messiah to do more miraculous signs than this man has done ? ”
43:7:032:0	When the Pharisees heard that the crowds were whispering such things , they and the leading priests sent Temple guards to arrest Jesus .
43:7:033:0	But Jesus told them , “ I will be with you only a little longer . Then I will return to the one who sent me .
43:7:034:0	You will search for me but not find me . And you can not go where I am going . ”
43:7:035:0	The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement . “ Where is he planning to go ? ” they asked . “ Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands ? Maybe he will even teach the Greeks !
43:7:004:1	Jesus Promises Living Water
43:7:036:0	What does he mean when he says , ‘ You will search for me but not find me , ' and ‘ You can not go where I am going ' ? ”
43:7:037:0	On the last day , the climax of the festival , Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds , “ Anyone who is thirsty may come to me !
43:7:038:0	Anyone who believes in me may come and drink ! For the Scriptures declare , ‘ Rivers of living water will flow from his heart . ' ”
43:7:005:1	Division and Unbelief
43:7:039:0	( When he said “ living water , ” he was speaking of the Spirit , who would be given to everyone believing in him . But the Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory . )
43:7:040:0	When the crowds heard him say this , some of them declared , “ Surely this man is the Prophet we 've been expecting . ”
43:7:041:0	Others said , “ He is the Messiah. ” Still others said , “ But he ca n't be ! Will the Messiah come from Galilee ?
43:7:042:0	For the Scriptures clearly state that the Messiah will be born of the royal line of David , in Bethlehem , the village where King David was born . ”
43:7:043:0	So the crowd was divided about him .
43:7:044:0	Some even wanted him arrested , but no one laid a hand on him .
43:7:045:0	When the Temple guards returned without having arrested Jesus , the leading priests and Pharisees demanded , “ Why did n't you bring him in ? ”
43:7:046:0	“ We have never heard anyone speak like this ! ” the guards responded .
43:7:047:0	“ Have you been led astray , too ? ” the Pharisees mocked .
43:7:048:0	“ Is there a single one of us rulers or Pharisees who believes in him ?
43:7:049:0	This foolish crowd follows him , but they are ignorant of the law . God 's curse is on them ! ”
43:7:050:0	Then Nicodemus , the leader who had met with Jesus earlier , spoke up .
43:7:051:0	“ Is it legal to convict a man before he is given a hearing ? ” he asked .
43:7:052:0	They replied , “ Are you from Galilee , too ? Search the Scriptures and see for yourself — no prophet ever comes from Galilee ! ” -- -- -- -- -- [ The most ancient Greek manuscripts do not include John 7:53–8:11 . ]
43:7:053:0	Then the meeting broke up , and everybody went home .
