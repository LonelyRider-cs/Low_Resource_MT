12:8:002:1	Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad
12:8:006:0	“ Is this true ? ” the king asked her . And she told him the story . So he directed one of his officials to see that everything she had lost was restored to her , including the value of any crops that had been harvested during her absence .
12:8:007:0	Elisha went to Damascus , the capital of Aram , where King Ben-hadad lay sick . When someone told the king that the man of God had come ,
12:8:008:0	the king said to Hazael , “ Take a gift to the man of God . Then tell him to ask the Lord , ‘ Will I recover from this illness ? ' ”
12:8:009:0	So Hazael loaded down forty camels with the finest products of Damascus as a gift for Elisha . He went to him and said , “ Your servant Ben-hadad , the king of Aram , has sent me to ask , ‘ Will I recover from this illness ? ' ”
12:8:010:0	And Elisha replied , “ Go and tell him , ‘ You will surely recover . ' But actually the Lord has shown me that he will surely die ! ”
12:8:011:0	Elisha stared at Hazael with a fixed gaze until Hazael became uneasy . Then the man of God started weeping .
12:8:012:0	“ What 's the matter , my lord ? ” Hazael asked him.Elisha replied , “ I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel . You will burn their fortified cities , kill their young men with the sword , dash their little children to the ground , and rip open their pregnant women ! ”
12:8:013:0	Hazael responded , “ How could a nobody like me ever accomplish such great things ? ” Elisha answered , “ The Lord has shown me that you are going to be the king of Aram . ”
12:8:014:0	When Hazael left Elisha and went back , the king asked him , “ What did Elisha tell you ? ” And Hazael replied , “ He told me that you will surely recover . ”

12:8:018:0	But Jehoram followed the example of the kings of Israel and was as wicked as King Ahab , for he had married one of Ahab 's daughters . So Jehoram did what was evil in the Lord 's sight .
12:8:019:0	But the Lord did not want to destroy Judah , for he had promised his servant David that his descendants would continue to rule , shining like a lamp forever .
12:8:020:0	During Jehoram 's reign , the Edomites revolted against Judah and crowned their own king .
12:8:021:0	So Jehoram went with all his chariots to attack the town of Zair . The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders , but he went out at night and attacked them under cover of darkness . But Jehoram 's army deserted him and fled to their homes .

12:8:027:0	Ahaziah followed the evil example of King Ahab 's family . He did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , just as Ahab 's family had done , for he was related by marriage to the family of Ahab .
12:8:028:0	Ahaziah joined Joram son of Ahab in his war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead . When the Arameans wounded King Joram in the battle ,
