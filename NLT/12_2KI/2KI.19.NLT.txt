12:19:001:1	Hezekiah Seeks the
12:19:002:1	Lord
12:19:003:1	's Help
12:19:001:0	When King Hezekiah heard their report , he tore his clothes and put on burlap and went into the Temple of the Lord .
12:19:002:0	And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator , Shebna the court secretary , and the leading priests , all dressed in burlap , to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz .
12:19:003:0	They told him , “ This is what King Hezekiah says : Today is a day of trouble , insults , and disgrace . It is like when a child is ready to be born , but the mother has no strength to deliver the baby .
12:19:004:0	But perhaps the Lord your God has heard the Assyrian chief of staff , sent by the king to defy the living God , and will punish him for his words . Oh , pray for those of us who are left ! ”
12:19:005:0	After King Hezekiah 's officials delivered the king 's message to Isaiah ,
12:19:006:0	the prophet replied , “ Say to your master , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Do not be disturbed by this blasphemous speech against me from the Assyrian king 's messengers .
12:19:007:0	Listen ! I myself will move against him , and the king will receive a message that he is needed at home . So he will return to his land , where I will have him killed with a sword . ' ”
12:19:008:0	Meanwhile , the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult the king of Assyria , who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah .
12:19:009:0	Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was leading an army to fight against him . Before leaving to meet the attack , he sent messengers back to Hezekiah in Jerusalem with this message :
12:19:010:0	“ This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah . Do n't let your God , in whom you trust , deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria .
12:19:011:0	You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone . They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way ! Why should you be any different ?
12:19:012:0	Have the gods of other nations rescued them—such nations as Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar ? My predecessors destroyed them all !
12:19:013:0	What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad ? What happened to the kings of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? ”
12:19:014:0	After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it , he went up to the Lord 's Temple and spread it out before the Lord .
12:19:015:0	And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the Lord : “ O Lord , God of Israel , you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim ! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You alone created the heavens and the earth .
12:19:016:0	Bend down , O Lord , and listen ! Open your eyes , O Lord , and see ! Listen to Sennacherib 's words of defiance against the living God .
12:19:017:0	“ It is true , Lord , that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations .
12:19:018:0	And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them . But of course the Assyrians could destroy them ! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands .
12:19:004:1	Isaiah Predicts Judah 's Deliverance
12:19:019:0	Now , O Lord our God , rescue us from his power ; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone , O Lord , are God . ”
12:19:020:0	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah : “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I have heard your prayer about King Sennacherib of Assyria .
12:19:021:0	And the Lord has spoken this word against him : “ The virgin daughter of Ziondespises you and laughs at you.The daughter of Jerusalemshakes her head in derision as you flee .
12:19:022:0	“ Whom have you been defying and ridiculing ? Against whom did you raise your voice ? At whom did you look with such haughty eyes ? It was the Holy One of Israel !
12:19:023:0	By your messengers you have defied the Lord.You have said , ‘ With my many chariotsI have conquered the highest mountains—yes , the remotest peaks of Lebanon.I have cut down its tallest cedarsand its finest cypress trees.I have reached its farthest cornersand explored its deepest forests .
12:19:024:0	I have dug wells in many foreign landsand refreshed myself with their water.With the sole of my footI stopped up all the rivers of Egypt ! '
12:19:025:0	“ But have you not heard ? I decided this long ago.Long ago I planned it , and now I am making it happen.I planned for you to crush fortified citiesinto heaps of rubble .
12:19:026:0	That is why their people have so little powerand are so frightened and confused.They are as weak as grass , as easily trampled as tender green shoots.They are like grass sprouting on a housetop , scorched before it can grow lush and tall .
12:19:027:0	“ But I know you well—where you stayand when you come and go.I know the way you have raged against me .
12:19:028:0	And because of your raging against meand your arrogance , which I have heard for myself , I will put my hook in your noseand my bit in your mouth.I will make you returnby the same road on which you came . ”
12:19:029:0	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Here is the proof that what I say is true : “ This year you will eat only what grows up by itself , and next year you will eat what springs up from that.But in the third year you will plant crops and harvest them ; you will tend vineyards and eat their fruit .
12:19:030:0	And you who are left in Judah , who have escaped the ravages of the siege , will put roots down in your own soiland will grow up and flourish .
12:19:031:0	For a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem , a group of survivors from Mount Zion.The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven 's Armieswill make this happen !
12:19:032:0	“ And this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria : “ His armies will not enter Jerusalem.They will not even shoot an arrow at it.They will not march outside its gates with their shieldsnor build banks of earth against its walls .
12:19:033:0	The king will return to his own countryby the same road on which he came.He will not enter this city , says the Lord .
12:19:034:0	For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David , I will defend this city and protect it . ”
12:19:035:0	That night the angel of the Lord went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers . When the surviving Assyrians woke up the next morning , they found corpses everywhere .
12:19:036:0	Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land . He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there .
12:19:037:0	One day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords . They then escaped to the land of Ararat , and another son , Esarhaddon , became the next king of Assyria .
