12:2:001:1	Elijah Taken into Heaven
12:2:001:0	When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind , Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal .
12:2:002:0	And Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here , for the Lord has told me to go to Bethel. ” But Elisha replied , “ As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live , I will never leave you ! ” So they went down together to Bethel .
12:2:003:0	The group of prophets from Bethel came to Elisha and asked him , “ Did you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today ? ” “ Of course I know , ” Elisha answered . “ But be quiet about it . ”
12:2:004:0	Then Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here , for the Lord has told me to go to Jericho. ” But Elisha replied again , “ As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live , I will never leave you. ” So they went on together to Jericho .
12:2:005:0	Then the group of prophets from Jericho came to Elisha and asked him , “ Did you know that the Lord is going to take your master away from you today ? ” “ Of course I know , ” Elisha answered . “ But be quiet about it . ”
12:2:006:0	Then Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here , for the Lord has told me to go to the Jordan River. ” But again Elisha replied , “ As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live , I will never leave you. ” So they went on together .
12:2:007:0	Fifty men from the group of prophets also went and watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped beside the Jordan River .
12:2:008:0	Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it . The river divided , and the two of them went across on dry ground !
12:2:009:0	When they came to the other side , Elijah said to Elisha , “ Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away. ” And Elisha replied , “ Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor . ”
12:2:010:0	“ You have asked a difficult thing , ” Elijah replied . “ If you see me when I am taken from you , then you will get your request . But if not , then you wo n't . ”
12:2:011:0	As they were walking along and talking , suddenly a chariot of fire appeared , drawn by horses of fire . It drove between the two men , separating them , and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven .
12:2:012:0	Elisha saw it and cried out , “ My father ! My father ! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel ! ” And as they disappeared from sight , Elisha tore his clothes in distress .
12:2:013:0	Elisha picked up Elijah 's cloak , which had fallen when he was taken up . Then Elisha returned to the bank of the Jordan River .
12:2:014:0	He struck the water with Elijah 's cloak and cried out , “ Where is the Lord , the God of Elijah ? ” Then the river divided , and Elisha went across .
12:2:015:0	When the group of prophets from Jericho saw from a distance what happened , they exclaimed , “ Elijah 's spirit rests upon Elisha ! ” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him .
12:2:016:0	“ Sir , ” they said , “ just say the word and fifty of our strongest men will search the wilderness for your master . Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has left him on some mountain or in some valley. ” “ No , ” Elisha said , “ do n't send them . ”
12:2:017:0	But they kept urging him until they shamed him into agreeing , and he finally said , “ All right , send them. ” So fifty men searched for three days but did not find Elijah .
12:2:002:1	Elisha 's First Miracles
12:2:018:0	Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned . “ Did n't I tell you not to go ? ” he asked .
12:2:019:0	One day the leaders of the town of Jericho visited Elisha . “ We have a problem , my lord , ” they told him . “ This town is located in pleasant surroundings , as you can see . But the water is bad , and the land is unproductive . ”
12:2:020:0	Elisha said , “ Bring me a new bowl with salt in it. ” So they brought it to him .
12:2:021:0	Then he went out to the spring that supplied the town with water and threw the salt into it . And he said , “ This is what the Lord says : I have purified this water . It will no longer cause death or infertility . ”
12:2:022:0	And the water has remained pure ever since , just as Elisha said .
12:2:023:0	Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel . As he was walking along the road , a group of boys from the town began mocking and making fun of him . “ Go away , baldy ! ” they chanted . “ Go away , baldy ! ”
12:2:024:0	Elisha turned around and looked at them , and he cursed them in the name of the Lord . Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of them .
12:2:025:0	From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and finally returned to Samaria .
