12:3:001:1	War between Israel and Moab
12:3:001:0	Ahab 's son Joram began to rule over Israel in the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat 's reign in Judah . He reigned in Samaria twelve years .
12:3:002:0	He did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , but not to the same extent as his father and mother . He at least tore down the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had set up .
12:3:003:0	Nevertheless , he continued in the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had committed and led the people of Israel to commit .
12:3:004:0	King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder . He used to pay the king of Israel an annual tribute of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams .
12:3:005:0	But after Ahab 's death , the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
12:3:006:0	So King Joram promptly mustered the army of Israel and marched from Samaria .
12:3:007:0	On the way , he sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah : “ The king of Moab has rebelled against me . Will you join me in battle against him ? ” And Jehoshaphat replied , “ Why , of course ! You and I are as one . My troops are your troops , and my horses are your horses . ”
12:3:008:0	Then Jehoshaphat asked , “ What route will we take ? ” “ We will attack from the wilderness of Edom , ” Joram replied .
12:3:009:0	The king of Edom and his troops joined them , and all three armies traveled along a roundabout route through the wilderness for seven days . But there was no water for the men or their animals .
12:3:010:0	“ What should we do ? ” the king of Israel cried out . “ The Lord has brought the three of us here to let the king of Moab defeat us . ”
12:3:011:0	But King Jehoshaphat of Judah asked , “ Is there no prophet of the Lord with us ? If there is , we can ask the Lord what to do through him. ” One of King Joram 's officers replied , “ Elisha son of Shaphat is here . He used to be Elijah 's personal assistant . ”
12:3:012:0	Jehoshaphat said , “ Yes , the Lord speaks through him. ” So the king of Israel , King Jehoshaphat of Judah , and the king of Edom went to consult with Elisha .
12:3:013:0	“ Why are you coming to me ? ” Elisha asked the king of Israel . “ Go to the pagan prophets of your father and mother ! ” But King Joram of Israel said , “ No ! For it was the Lord who called us three kings here — only to be defeated by the king of Moab ! ”
12:3:014:0	Elisha replied , “ As surely as the Lord Almighty lives , whom I serve , I would n't even bother with you except for my respect for King Jehoshaphat of Judah .
12:3:015:0	Now bring me someone who can play the harp. ” While the harp was being played , the power of the Lord came upon Elisha ,
12:3:016:0	and he said , “ This is what the Lord says : This dry valley will be filled with pools of water !
12:3:017:0	You will see neither wind nor rain , says the Lord , but this valley will be filled with water . You will have plenty for yourselves and your cattle and other animals .
12:3:018:0	But this is only a simple thing for the Lord , for he will make you victorious over the army of Moab !
12:3:019:0	You will conquer the best of their towns , even the fortified ones . You will cut down all their good trees , stop up all their springs , and ruin all their good land with stones . ”
12:3:020:0	The next day at about the time when the morning sacrifice was offered , water suddenly appeared ! It was flowing from the direction of Edom , and soon there was water everywhere .
12:3:021:0	Meanwhile , when the people of Moab heard about the three armies marching against them , they mobilized every man who was old enough to strap on a sword , and they stationed themselves along their border .
12:3:022:0	But when they got up the next morning , the sun was shining across the water , making it appear red to the Moabites — like blood .
12:3:023:0	“ It 's blood ! ” the Moabites exclaimed . “ The three armies must have attacked and killed each other ! Let 's go , men of Moab , and collect the plunder ! ”
12:3:024:0	But when the Moabites arrived at the Israelite camp , the army of Israel rushed out and attacked them until they turned and ran . The army of Israel chased them into the land of Moab , destroying everything as they went .
12:3:025:0	They destroyed the towns , covered their good land with stones , stopped up all the springs , and cut down all the good trees . Finally , only Kir-hareseth and its stone walls were left , but men with slings surrounded and attacked it .
12:3:026:0	When the king of Moab saw that he was losing the battle , he led 700 of his swordsmen in a desperate attempt to break through the enemy lines near the king of Edom , but they failed .
12:3:027:0	Then the king of Moab took his oldest son , who would have been the next king , and sacrificed him as a burnt offering on the wall . So there was great anger against Israel , and the Israelites withdrew and returned to their own land .
