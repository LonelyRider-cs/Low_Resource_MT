12:9:001:1	Jehu Anointed King of Israel
12:9:001:0	Meanwhile , Elisha the prophet had summoned a member of the group of prophets . “ Get ready to travel , ” he told him , “ and take this flask of olive oil with you . Go to Ramoth-gilead ,
12:9:002:0	and find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi . Call him into a private room away from his friends ,
12:9:003:0	and pour the oil over his head . Say to him , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I anoint you to be the king over Israel . ' Then open the door and run for your life ! ”
12:9:004:0	So the young prophet did as he was told and went to Ramoth-gilead .
12:9:005:0	When he arrived there , he found Jehu sitting around with the other army officers . “ I have a message for you , Commander , ” he said. “ For which one of us ? ” Jehu asked. “ For you , Commander , ” he replied .
12:9:006:0	So Jehu left the others and went into the house . Then the young prophet poured the oil over Jehu 's head and said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I anoint you king over the Lord 's people , Israel .
12:9:007:0	You are to destroy the family of Ahab , your master . In this way , I will avenge the murder of my prophets and all the Lord 's servants who were killed by Jezebel .
12:9:008:0	The entire family of Ahab must be wiped out . I will destroy every one of his male descendants , slave and free alike , anywhere in Israel .
12:9:009:0	I will destroy the family of Ahab as I destroyed the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and of Baasha son of Ahijah .
12:9:010:0	Dogs will eat Ahab 's wife Jezebel at the plot of land in Jezreel , and no one will bury her. ” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran .
12:9:011:0	Jehu went back to his fellow officers , and one of them asked him , “ What did that madman want ? Is everything all right ? ” “ You know how a man like that babbles on , ” Jehu replied .
12:9:012:0	“ You 're hiding something , ” they said . “ Tell us. ” So Jehu told them , “ He said to me , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I have anointed you to be king over Israel . ' ”
12:9:002:1	Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah
12:9:013:0	Then they quickly spread out their cloaks on the bare steps and blew the ram 's horn , shouting , “ Jehu is king ! ”
12:9:014:0	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi , led a conspiracy against King Joram . ( Now Joram had been with the army at Ramoth-gilead , defending Israel against the forces of King Hazael of Aram .
12:9:015:0	But King Joram was wounded in the fighting and returned to Jezreel to recover from his wounds . ) So Jehu told the men with him , “ If you want me to be king , do n't let anyone leave town and go to Jezreel to report what we have done . ”
12:9:016:0	Then Jehu got into a chariot and rode to Jezreel to find King Joram , who was lying there wounded . King Ahaziah of Judah was there , too , for he had gone to visit him .
12:9:017:0	The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu and his company approaching , so he shouted to Joram , “ I see a company of troops coming ! ” “ Send out a rider to ask if they are coming in peace , ” King Joram ordered .
12:9:018:0	So a horseman went out to meet Jehu and said , “ The king wants to know if you are coming in peace. ” Jehu replied , “ What do you know about peace ? Fall in behind me ! ” The watchman called out to the king , “ The messenger has met them , but he 's not returning . ”
12:9:019:0	So the king sent out a second horseman . He rode up to them and said , “ The king wants to know if you come in peace. ” Again Jehu answered , “ What do you know about peace ? Fall in behind me ! ”
12:9:020:0	The watchman exclaimed , “ The messenger has met them , but he is n't returning either ! It must be Jehu son of Nimshi , for he 's driving like a madman . ”
12:9:021:0	“ Quick ! Get my chariot ready ! ” King Joram commanded.Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah rode out in their chariots to meet Jehu . They met him at the plot of land that had belonged to Naboth of Jezreel .
12:9:022:0	King Joram demanded , “ Do you come in peace , Jehu ? ” Jehu replied , “ How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother , Jezebel , are all around us ? ”
12:9:023:0	Then King Joram turned the horses around and fled , shouting to King Ahaziah , “ Treason , Ahaziah ! ”
12:9:024:0	But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders . The arrow pierced his heart , and he sank down dead in his chariot .
12:9:025:0	Jehu said to Bidkar , his officer , “ Throw him into the plot of land that belonged to Naboth of Jezreel . Do you remember when you and I were riding along behind his father , Ahab ? The Lord pronounced this message against him :
12:9:026:0	‘ I solemnly swear that I will repay him here on this plot of land , says the Lord , for the murder of Naboth and his sons that I saw yesterday . ' So throw him out on Naboth 's property , just as the Lord said . ”
12:9:027:0	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what was happening , he fled along the road to Beth-haggan . Jehu rode after him , shouting , “ Shoot him , too ! ” So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot at the Ascent of Gur , near Ibleam . He was able to go on as far as Megiddo , but he died there .
12:9:028:0	His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem , where they buried him with his ancestors in the City of David .
12:9:003:1	The Death of Jezebel
12:9:029:0	Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab .
12:9:030:0	When Jezebel , the queen mother , heard that Jehu had come to Jezreel , she painted her eyelids and fixed her hair and sat at a window .
12:9:031:0	When Jehu entered the gate of the palace , she shouted at him , “ Have you come in peace , you murderer ? You 're just like Zimri , who murdered his master ! ”
12:9:032:0	Jehu looked up and saw her at the window and shouted , “ Who is on my side ? ” And two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
12:9:033:0	“ Throw her down ! ” Jehu yelled . So they threw her out the window , and her blood spattered against the wall and on the horses . And Jehu trampled her body under his horses ' hooves .
12:9:034:0	Then Jehu went into the palace and ate and drank . Afterward he said , “ Someone go and bury this cursed woman , for she is the daughter of a king . ”
12:9:035:0	But when they went out to bury her , they found only her skull , her feet , and her hands .
12:9:036:0	When they returned and told Jehu , he stated , “ This fulfills the message from the Lord , which he spoke through his servant Elijah from Tishbe : ‘ At the plot of land in Jezreel , dogs will eat Jezebel 's body .
12:9:037:0	Her remains will be scattered like dung on the plot of land in Jezreel , so that no one will be able to recognize her . ' ”
