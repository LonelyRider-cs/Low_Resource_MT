12:25:001:0	So on January 15 , during the ninth year of Zedekiah 's reign , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon led his entire army against Jerusalem . They surrounded the city and built siege ramps against its walls .
12:25:002:0	Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah 's reign .
12:25:003:0	By July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah 's reign , the famine in the city had become very severe , and the last of the food was entirely gone .
12:25:004:0	Then a section of the city wall was broken down . Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians , the soldiers waited for nightfall and escaped through the gate between the two walls behind the king 's garden . Then they headed toward the Jordan Valley .
12:25:005:0	But the Babylonian troops chased the king and overtook him on the plains of Jericho , for his men had all deserted him and scattered .
12:25:006:0	They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah , where they pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah .
12:25:001:1	The Temple Destroyed
12:25:007:0	They made Zedekiah watch as they slaughtered his sons . Then they gouged out Zedekiah 's eyes , bound him in bronze chains , and led him away to Babylon .
12:25:008:0	On August 14 of that year , which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar 's reign , Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard and an official of the Babylonian king , arrived in Jerusalem .
12:25:009:0	He burned down the Temple of the Lord , the royal palace , and all the houses of Jerusalem . He destroyed all the important buildings in the city .
12:25:010:0	Then he supervised the entire Babylonian army as they tore down the walls of Jerusalem on every side .
12:25:011:0	Then Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took as exiles the rest of the people who remained in the city , the defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the population .
12:25:012:0	But the captain of the guard allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind to care for the vineyards and fields .
12:25:013:0	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the Lord 's Temple , the bronze water carts , and the great bronze basin called the Sea , and they carried all the bronze away to Babylon .
12:25:014:0	They also took all the ash buckets , shovels , lamp snuffers , ladles , and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple .
12:25:015:0	The captain of the guard also took the incense burners and basins , and all the other articles made of pure gold or silver .
12:25:016:0	The weight of the bronze from the two pillars , the Sea , and the water carts was too great to be measured . These things had been made for the Lord 's Temple in the days of Solomon .
12:25:017:0	Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall . The bronze capital on top of each pillar was 71/2 feet high and was decorated with a network of bronze pomegranates all the way around .
12:25:018:0	Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest , Zephaniah the priest of the second rank , and the three chief gatekeepers .
12:25:019:0	And from among the people still hiding in the city , he took an officer who had been in charge of the Judean army ; five of the king 's personal advisers ; the army commander 's chief secretary , who was in charge of recruitment ; and sixty other citizens .
12:25:020:0	Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
12:25:002:1	Gedaliah Governs in Judah
12:25:021:0	And there at Riblah , in the land of Hamath , the king of Babylon had them all put to death . So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land .
12:25:022:0	Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan as governor over the people he had left in Judah .
12:25:023:0	When all the army commanders and their men learned that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor , they went to see him at Mizpah . These included Ishmael son of Nethaniah , Johanan son of Kareah , Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , Jezaniah son of the Maacathite , and all their men .
12:25:024:0	Gedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonian officials meant them no harm . “ Do n't be afraid of them . Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon , and all will go well for you , ” he promised .
12:25:025:0	But in midautumn of that year , Ishmael son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama , who was a member of the royal family , went to Mizpah with ten men and killed Gedaliah . He also killed all the Judeans and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah .
12:25:003:1	Hope for Israel 's Royal Line
12:25:026:0	Then all the people of Judah , from the least to the greatest , as well as the army commanders , fled in panic to Egypt , for they were afraid of what the Babylonians would do to them .
12:25:027:0	In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah , Evil-merodach ascended to the Babylonian throne . He was kind to Jehoiachin and released him from prison on April 2 of that year .
12:25:028:0	He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the other exiled kings in Babylon .
12:25:029:0	He supplied Jehoiachin with new clothes to replace his prison garb and allowed him to dine in the king 's presence for the rest of his life .
12:25:030:0	So the king gave him a regular food allowance as long as he lived .
