12:11:001:1	Queen Athaliah Rules in Judah
12:11:001:0	When Athaliah , the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah , learned that her son was dead , she began to destroy the rest of the royal family .
12:11:002:0	But Ahaziah 's sister Jehosheba , the daughter of King Jehoram , took Ahaziah 's infant son , Joash , and stole him away from among the rest of the king 's children , who were about to be killed . She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom , and they hid him from Athaliah , so the child was not murdered .
12:11:002:1	Revolt against Athaliah
12:11:003:0	Joash remained hidden in the Temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land .
12:11:004:0	In the seventh year of Athaliah 's reign , Jehoiada the priest summoned the commanders , the Carite mercenaries , and the palace guards to come to the Temple of the Lord . He made a solemn pact with them and made them swear an oath of loyalty there in the Lord 's Temple ; then he showed them the king 's son .
12:11:005:0	Jehoiada told them , “ This is what you must do . A third of you who are on duty on the Sabbath are to guard the royal palace itself .
12:11:006:0	Another third of you are to stand guard at the Sur Gate . And the final third must stand guard behind the palace guard . These three groups will all guard the palace .
12:11:007:0	The other two units who are off duty on the Sabbath must stand guard for the king at the Lord 's Temple .
12:11:008:0	Form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand . Kill anyone who tries to break through . Stay with the king wherever he goes . ”
12:11:009:0	So the commanders did everything as Jehoiada the priest ordered . The commanders took charge of the men reporting for duty that Sabbath , as well as those who were going off duty . They brought them all to Jehoiada the priest ,
12:11:010:0	and he supplied them with the spears and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of the Lord .
12:11:011:0	The palace guards stationed themselves around the king , with their weapons ready . They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar .
12:11:003:1	The Death of Athaliah
12:11:012:0	Then Jehoiada brought out Joash , the king 's son , placed the crown on his head , and presented him with a copy of God 's laws . They anointed him and proclaimed him king , and everyone clapped their hands and shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
12:11:013:0	When Athaliah heard the noise made by the palace guards and the people , she hurried to the Lord 's Temple to see what was happening .
12:11:014:0	When she arrived , she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar , as was the custom at times of coronation . The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him , and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets . When Athaliah saw all this , she tore her clothes in despair and shouted , “ Treason ! Treason ! ”
12:11:015:0	Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops , “ Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple , and kill anyone who tries to rescue her. ” For the priest had said , “ She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord . ”
12:11:004:1	Jehoiada 's Religious Reforms
12:11:016:0	So they seized her and led her out to the gate where horses enter the palace grounds , and she was killed there .
12:11:017:0	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people that they would be the Lord 's people . He also made a covenant between the king and the people .
12:11:018:0	And all the people of the land went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down . They demolished the altars and smashed the idols to pieces , and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.Jehoiada the priest stationed guards at the Temple of the Lord .
12:11:019:0	Then the commanders , the Carite mercenaries , the palace guards , and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the Lord . They went through the gate of the guards and into the palace , and the king took his seat on the royal throne .
12:11:020:0	So all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed at the king 's palace .
12:11:021:0	Joash was seven years old when he became king .
