12:22:001:1	Josiah Rules in Judah
12:22:001:0	Josiah was eight years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years . His mother was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath .
12:22:002:0	He did what was pleasing in the Lord 's sight and followed the example of his ancestor David . He did not turn away from doing what was right .
12:22:003:0	In the eighteenth year of his reign , King Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam , the court secretary , to the Temple of the Lord . He told him ,
12:22:004:0	“ Go to Hilkiah the high priest and have him count the money the gatekeepers have collected from the people at the Lord 's Temple .
12:22:005:0	Entrust this money to the men assigned to supervise the restoration of the Lord 's Temple . Then they can use it to pay workers to repair the Temple .
12:22:006:0	They will need to hire carpenters , builders , and masons . Also have them buy the timber and the finished stone needed to repair the Temple .

12:22:007:0	But do n't require the construction supervisors to keep account of the money they receive , for they are honest and trustworthy men . ”
12:22:008:0	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the court secretary , “ I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord 's Temple ! ” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan , and he read it .
12:22:009:0	Shaphan went to the king and reported , “ Your officials have turned over the money collected at the Temple of the Lord to the workers and supervisors at the Temple . ”
12:22:010:0	Shaphan also told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll. ” So Shaphan read it to the king .
12:22:011:0	When the king heard what was written in the Book of the Law , he tore his clothes in despair .
12:22:012:0	Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Acbor son of Micaiah , Shaphan the court secretary , and Asaiah the king 's personal adviser :
12:22:013:0	“ Go to the Temple and speak to the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah . Inquire about the words written in this scroll that has been found . For the Lord 's great anger is burning against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words in this scroll . We have not been doing everything it says we must do . ”
12:22:014:0	So Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam , Acbor , Shaphan , and Asaiah went to the New Quarter of Jerusalem to consult with the prophet Huldah . She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah , son of Harhas , the keeper of the Temple wardrobe .
12:22:015:0	She said to them , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , has spoken ! Go back and tell the man who sent you ,
12:22:016:0	‘ This is what the Lord says : I am going to bring disaster on this city and its people . All the words written in the scroll that the king of Judah has read will come true .
12:22:017:0	For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods , and I am very angry with them for everything they have done . My anger will burn against this place , and it will not be quenched . '
12:22:018:0	“ But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the Lord and tell him : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says concerning the message you have just heard :
12:22:019:0	You were sorry and humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I said against this city and its people—that this land would be cursed and become desolate . You tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance . And I have indeed heard you , says the Lord .
12:22:020:0	So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace . You will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city . ' ” So they took her message back to the king .
