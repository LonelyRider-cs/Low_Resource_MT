12:4:001:1	Elisha Helps a Poor Widow
12:4:001:0	One day the widow of a member of the group of prophets came to Elisha and cried out , “ My husband who served you is dead , and you know how he feared the Lord . But now a creditor has come , threatening to take my two sons as slaves . ”
12:4:002:0	“ What can I do to help you ? ” Elisha asked . “ Tell me , what do you have in the house ? ” “ Nothing at all , except a flask of olive oil , ” she replied .
12:4:003:0	And Elisha said , “ Borrow as many empty jars as you can from your friends and neighbors .
12:4:004:0	Then go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you . Pour olive oil from your flask into the jars , setting each one aside when it is filled . ”
12:4:005:0	So she did as she was told . Her sons kept bringing jars to her , and she filled one after another .
12:4:006:0	Soon every container was full to the brim ! “ Bring me another jar , ” she said to one of her sons. “ There are n't any more ! ” he told her . And then the olive oil stopped flowing .
12:4:002:1	Elisha and the Woman from Shunem
12:4:007:0	When she told the man of God what had happened , he said to her , “ Now sell the olive oil and pay your debts , and you and your sons can live on what is left over . ”
12:4:008:0	One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem . A wealthy woman lived there , and she urged him to come to her home for a meal . After that , whenever he passed that way , he would stop there for something to eat .
12:4:009:0	She said to her husband , “ I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God .
12:4:010:0	Let 's build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed , a table , a chair , and a lamp . Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by . ”
12:4:011:0	One day Elisha returned to Shunem , and he went up to this upper room to rest .
12:4:012:0	He said to his servant Gehazi , “ Tell the woman from Shunem I want to speak to her. ” When she appeared ,
12:4:013:0	Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Tell her , ‘ We appreciate the kind concern you have shown us . What can we do for you ? Can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army ? ' ” “ No , ” she replied , “ my family takes good care of me . ”
12:4:014:0	Later Elisha asked Gehazi , “ What can we do for her ? ” Gehazi replied , “ She does n't have a son , and her husband is an old man . ”
12:4:015:0	“ Call her back again , ” Elisha told him . When the woman returned , Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway ,
12:4:016:0	“ Next year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms ! ” “ No , my lord ! ” she cried . “ O man of God , do n't deceive me and get my hopes up like that . ”
12:4:017:0	But sure enough , the woman soon became pregnant . And at that time the following year she had a son , just as Elisha had said .
12:4:018:0	One day when her child was older , he went out to help his father , who was working with the harvesters .
12:4:019:0	Suddenly he cried out , “ My head hurts ! My head hurts ! ” His father said to one of the servants , “ Carry him home to his mother . ”
12:4:020:0	So the servant took him home , and his mother held him on her lap . But around noontime he died .
12:4:021:0	She carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God , then shut the door and left him there .
12:4:022:0	She sent a message to her husband : “ Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the man of God and come right back . ”
12:4:023:0	“ Why go today ? ” he asked . “ It is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath. ” But she said , “ It will be all right . ”
12:4:024:0	So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant , “ Hurry ! Do n't slow down unless I tell you to . ”
12:4:025:0	As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel , Elisha saw her in the distance . He said to Gehazi , “ Look , the woman from Shunem is coming .
12:4:026:0	Run out to meet her and ask her , ‘ Is everything all right with you , your husband , and your child ? ' ” “ Yes , ” the woman told Gehazi , “ everything is fine . ”
12:4:027:0	But when she came to the man of God at the mountain , she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet . Gehazi began to push her away , but the man of God said , “ Leave her alone . She is deeply troubled , but the Lord has not told me what it is . ”
12:4:028:0	Then she said , “ Did I ask you for a son , my lord ? And did n't I say , ‘ Do n't deceive me and get my hopes up ' ? ”
12:4:029:0	Then Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Get ready to travel ; take my staff and go ! Do n't talk to anyone along the way . Go quickly and lay the staff on the child 's face . ”
12:4:030:0	But the boy 's mother said , “ As surely as the Lord lives and you yourself live , I wo n't go home unless you go with me. ” So Elisha returned with her .
12:4:031:0	Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child 's face , but nothing happened . There was no sign of life . He returned to meet Elisha and told him , “ The child is still dead . ”
12:4:032:0	When Elisha arrived , the child was indeed dead , lying there on the prophet 's bed .
12:4:033:0	He went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the Lord .
12:4:034:0	Then he lay down on the child 's body , placing his mouth on the child 's mouth , his eyes on the child 's eyes , and his hands on the child 's hands . And as he stretched out on him , the child 's body began to grow warm again !
12:4:035:0	Elisha got up , walked back and forth across the room once , and then stretched himself out again on the child . This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes !
12:4:036:0	Then Elisha summoned Gehazi . “ Call the child 's mother ! ” he said . And when she came in , Elisha said , “ Here , take your son ! ”
12:4:003:1	Miracles during a Famine
12:4:037:0	She fell at his feet and bowed before him , overwhelmed with gratitude . Then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs .
12:4:038:0	Elisha now returned to Gilgal , and there was a famine in the land . One day as the group of prophets was seated before him , he said to his servant , “ Put a large pot on the fire , and make some stew for the rest of the group . ”
12:4:039:0	One of the young men went out into the field to gather herbs and came back with a pocketful of wild gourds . He shredded them and put them into the pot without realizing they were poisonous .
12:4:040:0	Some of the stew was served to the men . But after they had eaten a bite or two they cried out , “ Man of God , there 's poison in this stew ! ” So they would not eat it .
12:4:041:0	Elisha said , “ Bring me some flour. ” Then he threw it into the pot and said , “ Now it 's all right ; go ahead and eat. ” And then it did not harm them .
12:4:042:0	One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought the man of God a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest . Elisha said , “ Give it to the people so they can eat . ”
12:4:043:0	“ What ? ” his servant exclaimed . “ Feed a hundred people with only this ? ” But Elisha repeated , “ Give it to the people so they can eat , for this is what the Lord says : Everyone will eat , and there will even be some left over ! ”
12:4:044:0	And when they gave it to the people , there was plenty for all and some left over , just as the Lord had promised .
