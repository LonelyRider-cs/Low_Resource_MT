12:20:001:1	Hezekiah 's Sickness and Recovery
12:20:001:0	About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill , and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to visit him . He gave the king this message : “ This is what the Lord says : Set your affairs in order , for you are going to die . You will not recover from this illness . ”
12:20:002:0	When Hezekiah heard this , he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord ,
12:20:003:0	“ Remember , O Lord , how I have always been faithful to you and have served you single-mindedly , always doing what pleases you. ” Then he broke down and wept bitterly .
12:20:004:0	But before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard , this message came to him from the Lord :
12:20:005:0	“ Go back to Hezekiah , the leader of my people . Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : I have heard your prayer and seen your tears . I will heal you , and three days from now you will get out of bed and go to the Temple of the Lord .
12:20:006:0	I will add fifteen years to your life , and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own honor and for the sake of my servant David . ' ”
12:20:007:0	Then Isaiah said , “ Make an ointment from figs. ” So Hezekiah 's servants spread the ointment over the boil , and Hezekiah recovered !
12:20:008:0	Meanwhile , Hezekiah had said to Isaiah , “ What sign will the Lord give to prove that he will heal me and that I will go to the Temple of the Lord three days from now ? ”
12:20:009:0	Isaiah replied , “ This is the sign from the Lord to prove that he will do as he promised . Would you like the shadow on the sundial to go forward ten steps or backward ten steps ? ”
12:20:010:0	“ The shadow always moves forward , ” Hezekiah replied , “ so that would be easy . Make it go ten steps backward instead . ”
12:20:002:1	Envoys from Babylon
12:20:011:0	So Isaiah the prophet asked the Lord to do this , and he caused the shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial of Ahaz !
12:20:012:0	Soon after this , Merodach-baladan son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift , for he had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick .
12:20:013:0	Hezekiah received the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses—the silver , the gold , the spices , and the aromatic oils . He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries ! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them .
12:20:014:0	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him , “ What did those men want ? Where were they from ? ” Hezekiah replied , “ They came from the distant land of Babylon . ”
12:20:015:0	“ What did they see in your palace ? ” Isaiah asked. “ They saw everything , ” Hezekiah replied . “ I showed them everything I own—all my royal treasuries . ”
12:20:016:0	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to this message from the Lord :
12:20:017:0	The time is coming when everything in your palace—all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now—will be carried off to Babylon . Nothing will be left , says the Lord .
12:20:018:0	Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile . They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon 's king . ”
12:20:019:0	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah , “ This message you have given me from the Lord is good. ” For the king was thinking , “ At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime . ”
12:20:020:0	The rest of the events in Hezekiah 's reign , including the extent of his power and how he built a pool and dug a tunnel to bring water into the city , are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
12:20:021:0	Hezekiah died , and his son Manasseh became the next king .
