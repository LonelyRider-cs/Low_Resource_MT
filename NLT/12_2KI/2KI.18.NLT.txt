12:18:001:1	Hezekiah Rules in Judah
12:18:001:0	Hezekiah son of Ahaz began to rule over Judah in the third year of King Hoshea 's reign in Israel .
12:18:002:0	He was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years . His mother was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
12:18:003:0	He did what was pleasing in the Lord 's sight , just as his ancestor David had done .
12:18:004:0	He removed the pagan shrines , smashed the sacred pillars , and cut down the Asherah poles . He broke up the bronze serpent that Moses had made , because the people of Israel had been offering sacrifices to it . The bronze serpent was called Nehushtan .
12:18:005:0	Hezekiah trusted in the Lord , the God of Israel . There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah , either before or after his time .
12:18:006:0	He remained faithful to the Lord in everything , and he carefully obeyed all the commands the Lord had given Moses .
12:18:007:0	So the Lord was with him , and Hezekiah was successful in everything he did . He revolted against the king of Assyria and refused to pay him tribute .
12:18:008:0	He also conquered the Philistines as far distant as Gaza and its territory , from their smallest outpost to their largest walled city .
12:18:009:0	During the fourth year of Hezekiah 's reign , which was the seventh year of King Hoshea 's reign in Israel , King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked the city of Samaria and began a siege against it .
12:18:010:0	Three years later , during the sixth year of King Hezekiah 's reign and the ninth year of King Hoshea 's reign in Israel , Samaria fell .
12:18:011:0	At that time the king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria and placed them in colonies in Halah , along the banks of the Habor River in Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
12:18:002:1	Assyria Invades Judah
12:18:012:0	For they refused to listen to the Lord their God and obey him . Instead , they violated his covenant—all the laws that Moses the Lord 's servant had commanded them to obey .
12:18:013:0	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah 's reign , King Sennacherib of Assyria came to attack the fortified towns of Judah and conquered them .
12:18:014:0	King Hezekiah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish : “ I have done wrong . I will pay whatever tribute money you demand if you will only withdraw. ” The king of Assyria then demanded a settlement of more than eleven tons of silver and one ton of gold .
12:18:015:0	To gather this amount , King Hezekiah used all the silver stored in the Temple of the Lord and in the palace treasury .
12:18:016:0	Hezekiah even stripped the gold from the doors of the Lord 's Temple and from the doorposts he had overlaid with gold , and he gave it all to the Assyrian king .
12:18:017:0	Nevertheless , the king of Assyria sent his commander in chief , his field commander , and his chief of staff from Lachish with a huge army to confront King Hezekiah in Jerusalem . The Assyrians took up a position beside the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool , near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed .
12:18:003:1	Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem
12:18:018:0	They summoned King Hezekiah , but the king sent these officials to meet with them : Eliakim son of Hilkiah , the palace administrator ; Shebna the court secretary ; and Joah son of Asaph , the royal historian .
12:18:019:0	Then the Assyrian king 's chief of staff told them to give this message to Hezekiah : “ This is what the great king of Assyria says : What are you trusting in that makes you so confident ?
12:18:020:0	Do you think that mere words can substitute for military skill and strength ? Who are you counting on , that you have rebelled against me ?
12:18:021:0	On Egypt ? If you lean on Egypt , it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand . Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , is completely unreliable !
12:18:022:0	“ But perhaps you will say to me , ‘ We are trusting in the Lord our God ! ' But is n't he the one who was insulted by Hezekiah ? Did n't Hezekiah tear down his shrines and altars and make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem worship only at the altar here in Jerusalem ?
12:18:023:0	“ I 'll tell you what ! Strike a bargain with my master , the king of Assyria . I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them !
12:18:024:0	With your tiny army , how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master 's troops , even with the help of Egypt 's chariots and charioteers ?
12:18:025:0	What 's more , do you think we have invaded your land without the Lord 's direction ? The Lord himself told us , ‘ Attack this land and destroy it ! ' ”
12:18:026:0	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah , Shebna , and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff , “ Please speak to us in Aramaic , for we understand it well . Do n't speak in Hebrew , for the people on the wall will hear . ”
12:18:027:0	But Sennacherib 's chief of staff replied , “ Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master ? He wants all the people to hear it , for when we put this city under siege , they will suffer along with you . They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink their own urine . ”
12:18:028:0	Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall , “ Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria !
12:18:029:0	This is what the king says : Do n't let Hezekiah deceive you . He will never be able to rescue you from my power .
12:18:030:0	Do n't let him fool you into trusting in the Lord by saying , ‘ The Lord will surely rescue us . This city will never fall into the hands of the Assyrian king ! '
12:18:031:0	“ Do n't listen to Hezekiah ! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering : Make peace with me—open the gates and come out . Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well .
12:18:032:0	Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one—a land of grain and new wine , bread and vineyards , olive groves and honey . Choose life instead of death ! “ Do n't listen to Hezekiah when he tries to mislead you by saying , ‘ The Lord will rescue us ! '
12:18:033:0	Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of Assyria ?
12:18:034:0	What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power ?
12:18:035:0	What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power ? So what makes you think that the Lord can rescue Jerusalem from me ? ”
12:18:036:0	But the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had commanded them , “ Do not answer him . ”
12:18:037:0	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah , the palace administrator ; Shebna the court secretary ; and Joah son of Asaph , the royal historian , went back to Hezekiah . They tore their clothes in despair , and they went in to see the king and told him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said .
