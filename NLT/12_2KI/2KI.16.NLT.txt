12:16:001:1	Ahaz Rules in Judah
12:16:001:0	Ahaz son of Jotham began to rule over Judah in the seventeenth year of King Pekah 's reign in Israel .
12:16:002:0	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years . He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord his God , as his ancestor David had done .
12:16:003:0	Instead , he followed the example of the kings of Israel , even sacrificing his own son in the fire . In this way , he followed the detestable practices of the pagan nations the Lord had driven from the land ahead of the Israelites .
12:16:004:0	He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the pagan shrines and on the hills and under every green tree .
12:16:005:0	Then King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah of Israel came up to attack Jerusalem . They besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him .
12:16:006:0	At that time the king of Edom recovered the town of Elath for Edom . He drove out the people of Judah and sent Edomites to live there , as they do to this day .
12:16:007:0	King Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria with this message : “ I am your servant and your vassal . Come up and rescue me from the attacking armies of Aram and Israel . ”
12:16:008:0	Then Ahaz took the silver and gold from the Temple of the Lord and the palace treasury and sent it as a payment to the Assyrian king .
12:16:009:0	So the king of Assyria attacked the Aramean capital of Damascus and led its population away as captives , resettling them in Kir . He also killed King Rezin .
12:16:010:0	King Ahaz then went to Damascus to meet with King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria . While he was there , he took special note of the altar . Then he sent a model of the altar to Uriah the priest , along with its design in full detail .
12:16:011:0	Uriah followed the king 's instructions and built an altar just like it , and it was ready before the king returned from Damascus .
12:16:012:0	When the king returned , he inspected the altar and made offerings on it .
12:16:013:0	He presented a burnt offering and a grain offering , he poured out a liquid offering , and he sprinkled the blood of peace offerings on the altar .
12:16:014:0	Then King Ahaz removed the old bronze altar from its place in front of the Lord 's Temple , between the entrance and the new altar , and placed it on the north side of the new altar .
12:16:015:0	He told Uriah the priest , “ Use the new altar for the morning sacrifices of burnt offering , the evening grain offering , the king 's burnt offering and grain offering , and the burnt offerings of all the people , as well as their grain offerings and liquid offerings . Sprinkle the blood from all the burnt offerings and sacrifices on the new altar . The bronze altar will be for my personal use only . ”
12:16:016:0	Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz commanded him .
12:16:017:0	Then the king removed the side panels and basins from the portable water carts . He also removed the great bronze basin called the Sea from the backs of the bronze oxen and placed it on the stone pavement .
12:16:018:0	In deference to the king of Assyria , he also removed the canopy that had been constructed inside the palace for use on the Sabbath day , as well as the king 's outer entrance to the Temple of the Lord .
12:16:019:0	The rest of the events in Ahaz 's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
12:16:020:0	When Ahaz died , he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David . Then his son Hezekiah became the next king .
