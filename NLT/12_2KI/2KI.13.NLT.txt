12:13:003:0	So the Lord was very angry with Israel , and he allowed King Hazael of Aram and his son Ben-hadad to defeat them repeatedly .
12:13:004:0	Then Jehoahaz prayed for the Lord 's help , and the Lord heard his prayer , for he could see how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel .

12:13:006:0	But they continued to sin , following the evil example of Jeroboam . They also allowed the Asherah pole in Samaria to remain standing .

12:13:013:0	When Jehoash died , he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel . Then his son Jeroboam II became the next king .
12:13:014:0	When Elisha was in his last illness , King Jehoash of Israel visited him and wept over him . “ My father ! My father ! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel ! ” he cried .
12:13:015:0	Elisha told him , “ Get a bow and some arrows. ” And the king did as he was told .
12:13:016:0	Elisha told him , “ Put your hand on the bow , ” and Elisha laid his own hands on the king 's hands .
12:13:017:0	Then he commanded , “ Open that eastern window , ” and he opened it . Then he said , “ Shoot ! ” So he shot an arrow . Elisha proclaimed , “ This is the Lord 's arrow , an arrow of victory over Aram , for you will completely conquer the Arameans at Aphek . ”
12:13:018:0	Then he said , “ Now pick up the other arrows and strike them against the ground. ” So the king picked them up and struck the ground three times .
12:13:019:0	But the man of God was angry with him . “ You should have struck the ground five or six times ! ” he exclaimed . “ Then you would have beaten Aram until it was entirely destroyed . Now you will be victorious only three times . ”
12:13:020:0	Then Elisha died and was buried.Groups of Moabite raiders used to invade the land each spring .
12:13:021:0	Once when some Israelites were burying a man , they spied a band of these raiders . So they hastily threw the corpse into the tomb of Elisha and fled . But as soon as the body touched Elisha 's bones , the dead man revived and jumped to his feet !
12:13:022:0	King Hazael of Aram had oppressed Israel during the entire reign of King Jehoahaz .
12:13:023:0	But the Lord was gracious and merciful to the people of Israel , and they were not totally destroyed . He pitied them because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . And to this day he still has not completely destroyed them or banished them from his presence .
12:13:024:0	King Hazael of Aram died , and his son Ben-hadad became the next king .
12:13:025:0	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the towns that had been taken from Jehoash 's father , Jehoahaz . Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad on three occasions , and he recovered the Israelite towns .
