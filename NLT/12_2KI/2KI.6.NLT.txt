12:6:001:1	The Floating Ax Head
12:6:001:0	One day the group of prophets came to Elisha and told him , “ As you can see , this place where we meet with you is too small .
12:6:002:0	Let 's go down to the Jordan River , where there are plenty of logs . There we can build a new place for us to meet. ” “ All right , ” he told them , “ go ahead . ”
12:6:003:0	“ Please come with us , ” someone suggested. “ I will , ” he said .
12:6:004:0	So he went with them.When they arrived at the Jordan , they began cutting down trees .
12:6:005:0	But as one of them was cutting a tree , his ax head fell into the river . “ Oh , sir ! ” he cried . “ It was a borrowed ax ! ”
12:6:006:0	“ Where did it fall ? ” the man of God asked . When he showed him the place , Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot . Then the ax head floated to the surface .

12:6:007:0	“ Grab it , ” Elisha said . And the man reached out and grabbed it .
12:6:008:0	When the king of Aram was at war with Israel , he would confer with his officers and say , “ We will mobilize our forces at such and such a place . ”
12:6:009:0	But immediately Elisha , the man of God , would warn the king of Israel , “ Do not go near that place , for the Arameans are planning to mobilize their troops there . ”
12:6:010:0	So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God . Time and again Elisha warned the king , so that he would be on the alert there .
12:6:011:0	The king of Aram became very upset over this . He called his officers together and demanded , “ Which of you is the traitor ? Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans ? ”
12:6:012:0	“ It 's not us , my lord the king , ” one of the officers replied . “ Elisha , the prophet in Israel , tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom ! ”
12:6:013:0	“ Go and find out where he is , ” the king commanded , “ so I can send troops to seize him. ” And the report came back : “ Elisha is at Dothan . ”
12:6:014:0	So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city .
12:6:015:0	When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside , there were troops , horses , and chariots everywhere . “ Oh , sir , what will we do now ? ” the young man cried to Elisha .
12:6:016:0	“ Do n't be afraid ! ” Elisha told him . “ For there are more on our side than on theirs ! ”
12:6:017:0	Then Elisha prayed , “ O Lord , open his eyes and let him see ! ” The Lord opened the young man 's eyes , and when he looked up , he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire .
12:6:018:0	As the Aramean army advanced toward him , Elisha prayed , “ O Lord , please make them blind. ” So the Lord struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked .
12:6:019:0	Then Elisha went out and told them , “ You have come the wrong way ! This is n't the right city ! Follow me , and I will take you to the man you are looking for. ” And he led them to the city of Samaria .
12:6:020:0	As soon as they had entered Samaria , Elisha prayed , “ O Lord , now open their eyes and let them see. ” So the Lord opened their eyes , and they discovered that they were in the middle of Samaria .
12:6:021:0	When the king of Israel saw them , he shouted to Elisha , “ My father , should I kill them ? Should I kill them ? ”
12:6:022:0	“ Of course not ! ” Elisha replied . “ Do we kill prisoners of war ? Give them food and drink and send them home again to their master . ”

12:6:023:0	So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their master . After that , the Aramean raiders stayed away from the land of Israel .
12:6:024:0	Some time later , however , King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army and besieged Samaria .
12:6:025:0	As a result , there was a great famine in the city . The siege lasted so long that a donkey 's head sold for eighty pieces of silver , and a cup of dove 's dung sold for five pieces of silver .
12:6:026:0	One day as the king of Israel was walking along the wall of the city , a woman called to him , “ Please help me , my lord the king ! ”
12:6:027:0	He answered , “ If the Lord does n't help you , what can I do ? I have neither food from the threshing floor nor wine from the press to give you . ”
12:6:028:0	But then the king asked , “ What is the matter ? ” She replied , “ This woman said to me : ‘ Come on , let 's eat your son today , then we will eat my son tomorrow . '
12:6:029:0	So we cooked my son and ate him . Then the next day I said to her , ‘ Kill your son so we can eat him , ' but she has hidden her son . ”
12:6:030:0	When the king heard this , he tore his clothes in despair . And as the king walked along the wall , the people could see that he was wearing burlap under his robe next to his skin .
12:6:031:0	“ May God strike me and even kill me if I do n't separate Elisha 's head from his shoulders this very day , ” the king vowed .
12:6:032:0	Elisha was sitting in his house with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him . But before the messenger arrived , Elisha said to the elders , “ A murderer has sent a man to cut off my head . When he arrives , shut the door and keep him out . We will soon hear his master 's steps following him . ”
12:6:033:0	While Elisha was still saying this , the messenger arrived . And the king said , “ All this misery is from the Lord ! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer ? ”
