12:17:001:1	Hoshea Rules in Israel
12:17:001:0	Hoshea son of Elah began to rule over Israel in the twelfth year of King Ahaz 's reign in Judah . He reigned in Samaria nine years .
12:17:002:0	He did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , but not to the same extent as the kings of Israel who ruled before him .
12:17:003:0	King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked King Hoshea , so Hoshea was forced to pay heavy tribute to Assyria .
12:17:002:1	Samaria Falls to Assyria
12:17:004:0	But Hoshea stopped paying the annual tribute and conspired against the king of Assyria by asking King So of Egypt to help him shake free of Assyria 's power . When the king of Assyria discovered this treachery , he seized Hoshea and put him in prison .
12:17:005:0	Then the king of Assyria invaded the entire land , and for three years he besieged the city of Samaria .
12:17:006:0	Finally , in the ninth year of King Hoshea 's reign , Samaria fell , and the people of Israel were exiled to Assyria . They were settled in colonies in Halah , along the banks of the Habor River in Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
12:17:007:0	This disaster came upon the people of Israel because they worshiped other gods . They sinned against the Lord their God , who had brought them safely out of Egypt and had rescued them from the power of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt .
12:17:008:0	They had followed the practices of the pagan nations the Lord had driven from the land ahead of them , as well as the practices the kings of Israel had introduced .
12:17:009:0	The people of Israel had also secretly done many things that were not pleasing to the Lord their God . They built pagan shrines for themselves in all their towns , from the smallest outpost to the largest walled city .
12:17:010:0	They set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles at the top of every hill and under every green tree .
12:17:011:0	They offered sacrifices on all the hilltops , just like the nations the Lord had driven from the land ahead of them . So the people of Israel had done many evil things , arousing the Lord 's anger .
12:17:012:0	Yes , they worshiped idols , despite the Lord 's specific and repeated warnings .
12:17:013:0	Again and again the Lord had sent his prophets and seers to warn both Israel and Judah : “ Turn from all your evil ways . Obey my commands and decrees — the entire law that I commanded your ancestors to obey , and that I gave you through my servants the prophets . ”
12:17:014:0	But the Israelites would not listen . They were as stubborn as their ancestors who had refused to believe in the Lord their God .
12:17:015:0	They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors , and they despised all his warnings . They worshiped worthless idols , so they became worthless themselves . They followed the example of the nations around them , disobeying the Lord 's command not to imitate them .
12:17:016:0	They rejected all the commands of the Lord their God and made two calves from metal . They set up an Asherah pole and worshiped Baal and all the forces of heaven .
12:17:017:0	They even sacrificed their own sons and daughters in the fire . They consulted fortune-tellers and practiced sorcery and sold themselves to evil , arousing the Lord 's anger .
12:17:018:0	Because the Lord was very angry with Israel , he swept them away from his presence . Only the tribe of Judah remained in the land .
12:17:019:0	But even the people of Judah refused to obey the commands of the Lord their God , for they followed the evil practices that Israel had introduced .
12:17:020:0	The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel . He punished them by handing them over to their attackers until he had banished Israel from his presence .
12:17:021:0	For when the Lord tore Israel away from the kingdom of David , they chose Jeroboam son of Nebat as their king . But Jeroboam drew Israel away from following the Lord and made them commit a great sin .
12:17:022:0	And the people of Israel persisted in all the evil ways of Jeroboam . They did not turn from these sins
12:17:003:1	Foreigners Settle in Israel
12:17:023:0	until the Lord finally swept them away from his presence , just as all his prophets had warned . So Israel was exiled from their land to Assyria , where they remain to this day .
12:17:024:0	The king of Assyria transported groups of people from Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim and resettled them in the towns of Samaria , replacing the people of Israel . They took possession of Samaria and lived in its towns .
12:17:025:0	But since these foreign settlers did not worship the Lord when they first arrived , the Lord sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
12:17:026:0	So a message was sent to the king of Assyria : “ The people you have sent to live in the towns of Samaria do not know the religious customs of the God of the land . He has sent lions among them to destroy them because they have not worshiped him correctly . ”
12:17:027:0	The king of Assyria then commanded , “ Send one of the exiled priests back to Samaria . Let him live there and teach the new residents the religious customs of the God of the land . ”
12:17:028:0	So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria returned to Bethel and taught the new residents how to worship the Lord .
12:17:029:0	But these various groups of foreigners also continued to worship their own gods . In town after town where they lived , they placed their idols at the pagan shrines that the people of Samaria had built .
12:17:030:0	Those from Babylon worshiped idols of their god Succoth-benoth . Those from Cuthah worshiped their god Nergal . And those from Hamath worshiped Ashima .
12:17:031:0	The Avvites worshiped their gods Nibhaz and Tartak . And the people from Sepharvaim even burned their own children as sacrifices to their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech .
12:17:032:0	These new residents worshiped the Lord , but they also appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests to offer sacrifices at their places of worship .
12:17:033:0	And though they worshiped the Lord , they continued to follow their own gods according to the religious customs of the nations from which they came .
12:17:034:0	And this is still going on today . They continue to follow their former practices instead of truly worshiping the Lord and obeying the decrees , regulations , instructions , and commands he gave the descendants of Jacob , whose name he changed to Israel .
12:17:035:0	For the Lord had made a covenant with the descendants of Jacob and commanded them : “ Do not worship any other gods or bow before them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them .
12:17:036:0	But worship only the Lord , who brought you out of Egypt with great strength and a powerful arm . Bow down to him alone , and offer sacrifices only to him .
12:17:037:0	Be careful at all times to obey the decrees , regulations , instructions , and commands that he wrote for you . You must not worship other gods .
12:17:038:0	Do not forget the covenant I made with you , and do not worship other gods .
12:17:039:0	You must worship only the Lord your God . He is the one who will rescue you from all your enemies . ”
12:17:040:0	But the people would not listen and continued to follow their former practices .
12:17:041:0	So while these new residents worshiped the Lord , they also worshiped their idols . And to this day their descendants do the same .
