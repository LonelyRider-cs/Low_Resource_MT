57:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
57:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , a prisoner for preaching the Good News about Christ Jesus , and from our brother Timothy.I am writing to Philemon , our beloved co-worker ,
57:1:002:0	and to our sister Apphia , and to our fellow soldier Archippus , and to the church that meets in your house .
57:1:002:1	Paul 's Thanksgiving and Prayer
57:1:003:0	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
57:1:004:0	I always thank my God when I pray for you , Philemon ,
57:1:005:0	because I keep hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God 's people .
57:1:006:0	And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have in Christ .
57:1:003:1	Paul 's Appeal for Onesimus
57:1:007:0	Your love has given me much joy and comfort , my brother , for your kindness has often refreshed the hearts of God 's people .
57:1:008:0	That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you . I could demand it in the name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do .
57:1:009:0	But because of our love , I prefer simply to ask you . Consider this as a request from me — Paul , an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus .
57:1:010:0	I appeal to you to show kindness to my child , Onesimus . I became his father in the faith while here in prison .
57:1:011:0	Onesimus has n't been of much use to you in the past , but now he is very useful to both of us .
57:1:012:0	I am sending him back to you , and with him comes my own heart .
57:1:013:0	I wanted to keep him here with me while I am in these chains for preaching the Good News , and he would have helped me on your behalf .
57:1:014:0	But I did n't want to do anything without your consent . I wanted you to help because you were willing , not because you were forced .
57:1:015:0	It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever .
57:1:016:0	He is no longer like a slave to you . He is more than a slave , for he is a beloved brother , especially to me . Now he will mean much more to you , both as a man and as a brother in the Lord .
57:1:017:0	So if you consider me your partner , welcome him as you would welcome me .
57:1:018:0	If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything , charge it to me .
57:1:019:0	I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it . And I wo n't mention that you owe me your very soul !
57:1:020:0	Yes , my brother , please do me this favor for the Lord 's sake . Give me this encouragement in Christ .
57:1:021:0	I am confident as I write this letter that you will do what I ask and even more !
57:1:004:1	Paul 's Final Greetings
57:1:022:0	One more thing — please prepare a guest room for me , for I am hoping that God will answer your prayers and let me return to you soon .
57:1:023:0	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends you his greetings .
57:1:024:0	So do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my co-workers .
57:1:025:0	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
