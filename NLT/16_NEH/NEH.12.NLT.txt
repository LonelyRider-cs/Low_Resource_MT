16:12:023:0	A record of the heads of the Levite families was kept in The Book of History down to the days of Johanan , the grandson of Eliashib .
16:12:024:0	These were the family leaders of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , and other associates , who stood opposite them during the ceremonies of praise and thanksgiving , one section responding to the other , as commanded by David , the man of God .
16:12:025:0	This included Mattaniah , Bakbukiah , and Obadiah.Meshullam , Talmon , and Akkub were the gatekeepers in charge of the storerooms at the gates .
16:12:002:1	Dedication of Jerusalem 's Wall
16:12:026:0	These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua , son of Jehozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe .
16:12:027:0	For the dedication of the new wall of Jerusalem , the Levites throughout the land were asked to come to Jerusalem to assist in the ceremonies . They were to take part in the joyous occasion with their songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals , harps , and lyres .
16:12:028:0	The singers were brought together from the region around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites .
16:12:029:0	They also came from Beth-gilgal and the rural areas near Geba and Azmaveth , for the singers had built their own settlements around Jerusalem .
16:12:030:0	The priests and Levites first purified themselves ; then they purified the people , the gates , and the wall .
16:12:031:0	I led the leaders of Judah to the top of the wall and organized two large choirs to give thanks . One of the choirs proceeded southward along the top of the wall to the Dung Gate .
16:12:032:0	Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them ,
16:12:033:0	along with Azariah , Ezra , Meshullam ,
16:12:034:0	Judah , Benjamin , Shemaiah , and Jeremiah .
16:12:035:0	Then came some priests who played trumpets , including Zechariah son of Jonathan , son of Shemaiah , son of Mattaniah , son of Micaiah , son of Zaccur , a descendant of Asaph .
16:12:036:0	And Zechariah 's colleagues were Shemaiah , Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , Judah , and Hanani . They used the musical instruments prescribed by David , the man of God . Ezra the scribe led this procession .
16:12:037:0	At the Fountain Gate they went straight up the steps on the ascent of the city wall toward the City of David . They passed the house of David and then proceeded to the Water Gate on the east .
16:12:038:0	The second choir giving thanks went northward around the other way to meet them . I followed them , together with the other half of the people , along the top of the wall past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall ,
16:12:039:0	then past the Ephraim Gate to the Old City Gate , past the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel , and on to the Tower of the Hundred . Then we continued on to the Sheep Gate and stopped at the Guard Gate .
16:12:040:0	The two choirs that were giving thanks then proceeded to the Temple of God , where they took their places . So did I , together with the group of leaders who were with me .
16:12:041:0	We went together with the trumpet-playing priests — Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah —
16:12:042:0	and the singers — Maaseiah , Shemaiah , Eleazar , Uzzi , Jehohanan , Malkijah , Elam , and Ezer . They played and sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah the choir director .
16:12:003:1	Provisions for Temple Worship
16:12:043:0	Many sacrifices were offered on that joyous day , for God had given the people cause for great joy . The women and children also participated in the celebration , and the joy of the people of Jerusalem could be heard far away .
16:12:044:0	On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the offerings , the first part of the harvest , and the tithes . They were responsible to collect from the fields outside the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites . For all the people of Judah took joy in the priests and Levites and their work .
16:12:045:0	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification , as commanded by David and his son Solomon , and so did the singers and the gatekeepers .
16:12:046:0	The custom of having choir directors to lead the choirs in hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God began long ago in the days of David and Asaph .
16:12:047:0	So now , in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah , all Israel brought a daily supply of food for the singers , the gatekeepers , and the Levites . The Levites , in turn , gave a portion of what they received to the priests , the descendants of Aaron .
