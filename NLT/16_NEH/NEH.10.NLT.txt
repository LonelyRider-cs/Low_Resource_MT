16:10:027:0	Malluch , Harim , and Baanah .
16:10:028:0	Then the rest of the people—the priests , Levites , gatekeepers , singers , Temple servants , and all who had separated themselves from the pagan people of the land in order to obey the Law of God , together with their wives , sons , daughters , and all who were old enough to understand—
16:10:029:0	joined their leaders and bound themselves with an oath . They swore a curse on themselves if they failed to obey the Law of God as issued by his servant Moses . They solemnly promised to carefully follow all the commands , regulations , and decrees of the Lord our Lord :
16:10:030:0	“ We promise not to let our daughters marry the pagan people of the land , and not to let our sons marry their daughters .
16:10:031:0	“ We also promise that if the people of the land should bring any merchandise or grain to be sold on the Sabbath or on any other holy day , we will refuse to buy it . Every seventh year we will let our land rest , and we will cancel all debts owed to us .
16:10:032:0	“ In addition , we promise to obey the command to pay the annual Temple tax of one-eighth of an ounce of silver for the care of the Temple of our God .
16:10:033:0	This will provide for the Bread of the Presence ; for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings ; for the offerings on the Sabbaths , the new moon celebrations , and the annual festivals ; for the holy offerings ; and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel . It will provide for everything necessary for the work of the Temple of our God .
16:10:034:0	“ We have cast sacred lots to determine when—at regular times each year—the families of the priests , Levites , and the common people should bring wood to God 's Temple to be burned on the altar of the Lord our God , as is written in the Law .
16:10:035:0	“ We promise to bring the first part of every harvest to the Lord 's Temple year after year—whether it be a crop from the soil or from our fruit trees .
16:10:036:0	We agree to give God our oldest sons and the firstborn of all our herds and flocks , as prescribed in the Law . We will present them to the priests who minister in the Temple of our God .
16:10:037:0	We will store the produce in the storerooms of the Temple of our God . We will bring the best of our flour and other grain offerings , the best of our fruit , and the best of our new wine and olive oil . And we promise to bring to the Levites a tenth of everything our land produces , for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all our rural towns .
16:10:038:0	“ A priest—a descendant of Aaron—will be with the Levites as they receive these tithes . And a tenth of all that is collected as tithes will be delivered by the Levites to the Temple of our God and placed in the storerooms .
16:10:039:0	The people and the Levites must bring these offerings of grain , new wine , and olive oil to the storerooms and place them in the sacred containers near the ministering priests , the gatekeepers , and the singers. “ We promise together not to neglect the Temple of our God . ”
