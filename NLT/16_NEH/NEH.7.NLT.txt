16:7:001:0	After the wall was finished and I had set up the doors in the gates , the gatekeepers , singers , and Levites were appointed .
16:7:002:0	I gave the responsibility of governing Jerusalem to my brother Hanani , along with Hananiah , the commander of the fortress , for he was a faithful man who feared God more than most .
16:7:001:1	Nehemiah Registers the People
16:7:003:0	I said to them , “ Do not leave the gates open during the hottest part of the day . And even while the gatekeepers are on duty , have them shut and bar the doors .
