16:1:001:1	Nehemiah 's Concern for Jerusalem
16:1:001:0	These are the memoirs of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.In late autumn , in the month of Kislev , in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes ' reign , I was at the fortress of Susa .
16:1:002:0	Hanani , one of my brothers , came to visit me with some other men who had just arrived from Judah . I asked them about the Jews who had returned there from captivity and about how things were going in Jerusalem .
16:1:003:0	They said to me , “ Things are not going well for those who returned to the province of Judah . They are in great trouble and disgrace . The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down , and the gates have been destroyed by fire . ”
16:1:004:0	When I heard this , I sat down and wept . In fact , for days I mourned , fasted , and prayed to the God of heaven .
16:1:005:0	Then I said , “ O Lord , God of heaven , the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of unfailing love with those who love him and obey his commands ,
16:1:006:0	listen to my prayer ! Look down and see me praying night and day for your people Israel . I confess that we have sinned against you . Yes , even my own family and I have sinned !
16:1:007:0	We have sinned terribly by not obeying the commands , decrees , and regulations that you gave us through your servant Moses .
16:1:008:0	“ Please remember what you told your servant Moses : ‘ If you are unfaithful to me , I will scatter you among the nations .
16:1:009:0	But if you return to me and obey my commands and live by them , then even if you are exiled to the ends of the earth , I will bring you back to the place I have chosen for my name to be honored . '
16:1:010:0	“ The people you rescued by your great power and strong hand are your servants .
16:1:011:0	O Lord , please hear my prayer ! Listen to the prayers of those of us who delight in honoring you . Please grant me success today by making the king favorable to me . Put it into his heart to be kind to me. ” In those days I was the king 's cup-bearer .
