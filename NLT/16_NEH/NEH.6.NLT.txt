16:6:001:1	Continued Opposition to Rebuilding
16:6:001:0	Sanballat , Tobiah , Geshem the Arab , and the rest of our enemies found out that I had finished rebuilding the wall and that no gaps remained — though we had not yet set up the doors in the gates .
16:6:002:0	So Sanballat and Geshem sent a message asking me to meet them at one of the villages in the plain of Ono.But I realized they were plotting to harm me ,
16:6:003:0	so I replied by sending this message to them : “ I am engaged in a great work , so I ca n't come . Why should I stop working to come and meet with you ? ”
16:6:004:0	Four times they sent the same message , and each time I gave the same reply .
16:6:005:0	The fifth time , Sanballat 's servant came with an open letter in his hand ,
16:6:006:0	and this is what it said : “ There is a rumor among the surrounding nations , and Geshem tells me it is true , that you and the Jews are planning to rebel and that is why you are building the wall . According to his reports , you plan to be their king .
16:6:007:0	He also reports that you have appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim about you , ‘ Look ! There is a king in Judah ! ' “ You can be very sure that this report will get back to the king , so I suggest that you come and talk it over with me . ”
16:6:008:0	I replied , “ There is no truth in any part of your story . You are making up the whole thing . ”
16:6:009:0	They were just trying to intimidate us , imagining that they could discourage us and stop the work . So I continued the work with even greater determination .
16:6:010:0	Later I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel , who was confined to his home . He said , “ Let us meet together inside the Temple of God and bolt the doors shut . Your enemies are coming to kill you tonight . ”
16:6:011:0	But I replied , “ Should someone in my position run from danger ? Should someone in my position enter the Temple to save his life ? No , I wo n't do it ! ”
16:6:012:0	I realized that God had not spoken to him , but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
16:6:013:0	They were hoping to intimidate me and make me sin . Then they would be able to accuse and discredit me .
16:6:002:1	The Builders Complete the Wall
16:6:014:0	Remember , O my God , all the evil things that Tobiah and Sanballat have done . And remember Noadiah the prophet and all the prophets like her who have tried to intimidate me .
16:6:015:0	So on October 2 the wall was finished — just fifty-two days after we had begun .
16:6:016:0	When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it , they were frightened and humiliated . They realized this work had been done with the help of our God .
16:6:017:0	During those fifty-two days , many letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles of Judah .
16:6:018:0	For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him because his father-in-law was Shecaniah son of Arah , and his son Jehohanan was married to the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah .
16:6:019:0	They kept telling me about Tobiah 's good deeds , and then they told him everything I said . And Tobiah kept sending threatening letters to intimidate me .
