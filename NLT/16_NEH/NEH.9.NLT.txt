16:9:001:1	The People Confess Their Sins
16:9:001:0	On October 31 the people assembled again , and this time they fasted and dressed in burlap and sprinkled dust on their heads .
16:9:002:0	Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners as they confessed their own sins and the sins of their ancestors .
16:9:003:0	They remained standing in place for three hours while the Book of the Law of the Lord their God was read aloud to them . Then for three more hours they confessed their sins and worshiped the Lord their God .
16:9:004:0	The Levites — Jeshua , Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Kenani — stood on the stairway of the Levites and cried out to the Lord their God with loud voices .
16:9:005:0	Then the leaders of the Levites — Jeshua , Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabneiah , Sherebiah , Hodiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah — called out to the people : “ Stand up and praise the Lord your God , for he lives from everlasting to everlasting ! ” Then they prayed : “ May your glorious name be praised ! May it be exalted above all blessing and praise !
16:9:006:0	“ You alone are the Lord . You made the skies and the heavens and all the stars . You made the earth and the seas and everything in them . You preserve them all , and the angels of heaven worship you .
16:9:007:0	“ You are the Lord God , who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and renamed him Abraham .
16:9:008:0	When he had proved himself faithful , you made a covenant with him to give him and his descendants the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Jebusites , and Girgashites . And you have done what you promised , for you are always true to your word .
16:9:009:0	“ You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt , and you heard their cries from beside the Red Sea .
16:9:010:0	You displayed miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh , his officials , and all his people , for you knew how arrogantly they were treating our ancestors . You have a glorious reputation that has never been forgotten .
16:9:011:0	You divided the sea for your people so they could walk through on dry land ! And then you hurled their enemies into the depths of the sea . They sank like stones beneath the mighty waters .
16:9:012:0	You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way .
16:9:013:0	“ You came down at Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven . You gave them regulations and instructions that were just , and decrees and commands that were good .
16:9:014:0	You instructed them concerning your holy Sabbath . And you commanded them , through Moses your servant , to obey all your commands , decrees , and instructions .
16:9:015:0	“ You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and water from the rock when they were thirsty . You commanded them to go and take possession of the land you had sworn to give them .
16:9:016:0	“ But our ancestors were proud and stubborn , and they paid no attention to your commands .
16:9:017:0	They refused to obey and did not remember the miracles you had done for them . Instead , they became stubborn and appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery in Egypt . But you are a God of forgiveness , gracious and merciful , slow to become angry , and rich in unfailing love . You did not abandon them ,
16:9:018:0	even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said , ‘ This is your god who brought you out of Egypt ! ' They committed terrible blasphemies .
16:9:019:0	“ But in your great mercy you did not abandon them to die in the wilderness . The pillar of cloud still led them forward by day , and the pillar of fire showed them the way through the night .
16:9:020:0	You sent your good Spirit to instruct them , and you did not stop giving them manna from heaven or water for their thirst .
16:9:021:0	For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness , and they lacked nothing . Their clothes did not wear out , and their feet did not swell !
16:9:022:0	“ Then you helped our ancestors conquer kingdoms and nations , and you placed your people in every corner of the land . They took over the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and the land of King Og of Bashan .
16:9:023:0	You made their descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and brought them into the land you had promised to their ancestors .
16:9:024:0	“ They went in and took possession of the land . You subdued whole nations before them . Even the Canaanites , who inhabited the land , were powerless ! Your people could deal with these nations and their kings as they pleased .
16:9:025:0	Our ancestors captured fortified cities and fertile land . They took over houses full of good things , with cisterns already dug and vineyards and olive groves and fruit trees in abundance . So they ate until they were full and grew fat and enjoyed themselves in all your blessings .
16:9:026:0	“ But despite all this , they were disobedient and rebelled against you . They turned their backs on your Law , they killed your prophets who warned them to return to you , and they committed terrible blasphemies .
16:9:027:0	So you handed them over to their enemies , who made them suffer . But in their time of trouble they cried to you , and you heard them from heaven . In your great mercy , you sent them liberators who rescued them from their enemies .
16:9:028:0	“ But as soon as they were at peace , your people again committed evil in your sight , and once more you let their enemies conquer them . Yet whenever your people turned and cried to you again for help , you listened once more from heaven . In your wonderful mercy , you rescued them many times !
16:9:029:0	“ You warned them to return to your Law , but they became proud and obstinate and disobeyed your commands . They did not follow your regulations , by which people will find life if only they obey . They stubbornly turned their backs on you and refused to listen .
16:9:030:0	In your love , you were patient with them for many years . You sent your Spirit , who warned them through the prophets . But still they would n't listen ! So once again you allowed the peoples of the land to conquer them .
16:9:031:0	But in your great mercy , you did not destroy them completely or abandon them forever . What a gracious and merciful God you are !
16:9:032:0	“ And now , our God , the great and mighty and awesome God , who keeps his covenant of unfailing love , do not let all the hardships we have suffered seem insignificant to you . Great trouble has come upon us and upon our kings and leaders and priests and prophets and ancestors — all of your people — from the days when the kings of Assyria first triumphed over us until now .
16:9:033:0	Every time you punished us you were being just . We have sinned greatly , and you gave us only what we deserved .
16:9:034:0	Our kings , leaders , priests , and ancestors did not obey your Law or listen to the warnings in your commands and laws .
16:9:035:0	Even while they had their own kingdom , they did not serve you , though you showered your goodness on them . You gave them a large , fertile land , but they refused to turn from their wickedness .
16:9:036:0	“ So now today we are slaves in the land of plenty that you gave our ancestors for their enjoyment ! We are slaves here in this good land .
16:9:002:1	The People Agree to Obey
16:9:037:0	The lush produce of this land piles up in the hands of the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins . They have power over us and our livestock . We serve them at their pleasure , and we are in great misery . ”
16:9:038:0	The people responded , “ In view of all this , we are making a solemn promise and putting it in writing . On this sealed document are the names of our leaders and Levites and priests . ”
