64:1:001:1	Greetings
64:1:001:0	This letter is from John , the elder.I am writing to Gaius , my dear friend , whom I love in the truth .
64:1:002:0	Dear friend , I hope all is well with you and that you are as healthy in body as you are strong in spirit .
64:1:003:0	Some of the traveling teachers recently returned and made me very happy by telling me about your faithfulness and that you are living according to the truth .
64:1:002:1	Caring for the Lord 's Workers
64:1:004:0	I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children are following the truth .
64:1:005:0	Dear friend , you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who pass through , even though they are strangers to you .
64:1:006:0	They have told the church here of your loving friendship . Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that pleases God .
64:1:007:0	For they are traveling for the Lord , and they accept nothing from people who are not believers .
64:1:008:0	So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as they teach the truth .
64:1:009:0	I wrote to the church about this , but Diotrephes , who loves to be the leader , refuses to have anything to do with us .
64:1:010:0	When I come , I will report some of the things he is doing and the evil accusations he is making against us . Not only does he refuse to welcome the traveling teachers , he also tells others not to help them . And when they do help , he puts them out of the church .
64:1:011:0	Dear friend , do n't let this bad example influence you . Follow only what is good . Remember that those who do good prove that they are God 's children , and those who do evil prove that they do not know God .
64:1:003:1	Conclusion
64:1:012:0	Everyone speaks highly of Demetrius , as does the truth itself . We ourselves can say the same for him , and you know we speak the truth .
64:1:013:0	I have much more to say to you , but I do n't want to write it with pen and ink .
64:1:014:0	For I hope to see you soon , and then we will talk face to face .
64:1:015:0	Peace be with you.Your friends here send you their greetings . Please give my personal greetings to each of our friends there .
