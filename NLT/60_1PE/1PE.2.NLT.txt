60:2:001:0	So get rid of all evil behavior . Be done with all deceit , hypocrisy , jealousy , and all unkind speech .
60:2:002:0	Like newborn babies , you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation . Cry out for this nourishment ,
60:2:001:1	Living Stones for God 's House
60:2:003:0	now that you have had a taste of the Lord 's kindness .
60:2:004:0	You are coming to Christ , who is the living cornerstone of God 's temple . He was rejected by people , but he was chosen by God for great honor .
60:2:005:0	And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple . What 's more , you are his holy priests . Through the mediation of Jesus Christ , you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God .
60:2:006:0	As the Scriptures say , “ I am placing a cornerstone in Jerusalem , chosen for great honor , and anyone who trusts in himwill never be disgraced . ”
60:2:007:0	Yes , you who trust him recognize the honor God has given him . But for those who reject him , “ The stone that the builders rejectedhas now become the cornerstone . ”
60:2:008:0	And , “ He is the stone that makes people stumble , the rock that makes them fall. ” They stumble because they do not obey God 's word , and so they meet the fate that was planned for them .
60:2:009:0	But you are not like that , for you are a chosen people . You are royal priests , a holy nation , God 's very own possession . As a result , you can show others the goodness of God , for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light .
60:2:010:0	“ Once you had no identity as a people ; now you are God 's people.Once you received no mercy ; now you have received God 's mercy . ”
60:2:011:0	Dear friends , I warn you as “ temporary residents and foreigners ” to keep away from worldly desires that wage war against your very souls .
60:2:002:1	Respecting People in Authority
60:2:012:0	Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors . Then even if they accuse you of doing wrong , they will see your honorable behavior , and they will give honor to God when he judges the world .
60:2:013:0	For the Lord 's sake , submit to all human authority—whether the king as head of state ,
60:2:014:0	or the officials he has appointed . For the king has sent them to punish those who do wrong and to honor those who do right .
60:2:015:0	It is God 's will that your honorable lives should silence those ignorant people who make foolish accusations against you .
60:2:016:0	For you are free , yet you are God 's slaves , so do n't use your freedom as an excuse to do evil .
60:2:003:1	Slaves
60:2:017:0	Respect everyone , and love the family of believers . Fear God , and respect the king .
60:2:018:0	You who are slaves must submit to your masters with all respect . Do what they tell you—not only if they are kind and reasonable , but even if they are cruel .
60:2:019:0	For God is pleased when , conscious of his will , you patiently endure unjust treatment .
60:2:020:0	Of course , you get no credit for being patient if you are beaten for doing wrong . But if you suffer for doing good and endure it patiently , God is pleased with you .
60:2:021:0	For God called you to do good , even if it means suffering , just as Christ suffered for you . He is your example , and you must follow in his steps .
60:2:022:0	He never sinned , nor ever deceived anyone .
60:2:023:0	He did not retaliate when he was insulted , nor threaten revenge when he suffered.He left his case in the hands of God , who always judges fairly .
60:2:024:0	He personally carried our sinsin his body on the crossso that we can be dead to sinand live for what is right.By his woundsyou are healed .
60:2:025:0	Once you were like sheepwho wandered away.But now you have turned to your Shepherd , the Guardian of your souls .
