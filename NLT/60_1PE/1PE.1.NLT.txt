60:1:001:1	Greetings from Peter
60:1:001:0	This letter is from Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ.I am writing to God 's chosen people who are living as foreigners in the provinces of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
60:1:002:1	The Hope of Eternal Life
60:1:002:0	God the Father knew you and chose you long ago , and his Spirit has made you holy . As a result , you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ.May God give you more and more grace and peace .
60:1:003:0	All praise to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . It is by his great mercy that we have been born again , because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead . Now we live with great expectation ,
60:1:004:0	and we have a priceless inheritance—an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you , pure and undefiled , beyond the reach of change and decay .
60:1:005:0	And through your faith , God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation , which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see .
60:1:006:0	So be truly glad . There is wonderful joy ahead , even though you must endure many trials for a little while .
60:1:007:0	These trials will show that your faith is genuine . It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold—though your faith is far more precious than mere gold . So when your faith remains strong through many trials , it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world .
60:1:008:0	You love him even though you have never seen him . Though you do not see him now , you trust him ; and you rejoice with a glorious , inexpressible joy .
60:1:009:0	The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls .
60:1:010:0	This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when they prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you .
60:1:011:0	They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ 's suffering and his great glory afterward .
60:1:003:1	A Call to Holy Living
60:1:012:0	They were told that their messages were not for themselves , but for you . And now this Good News has been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . It is all so wonderful that even the angels are eagerly watching these things happen .
60:1:013:0	So prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control . Put all your hope in the gracious salvation that will come to you when Jesus Christ is revealed to the world .
60:1:014:0	So you must live as God 's obedient children . Do n't slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires . You did n't know any better then .
60:1:015:0	But now you must be holy in everything you do , just as God who chose you is holy .
60:1:016:0	For the Scriptures say , “ You must be holy because I am holy . ”
60:1:017:0	And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has no favorites . He will judge or reward you according to what you do . So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time here as “ temporary residents . ”
60:1:018:0	For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors . And it was not paid with mere gold or silver , which lose their value .
60:1:019:0	It was the precious blood of Christ , the sinless , spotless Lamb of God .
60:1:020:0	God chose him as your ransom long before the world began , but now in these last days he has been revealed for your sake .
60:1:021:0	Through Christ you have come to trust in God . And you have placed your faith and hope in God because he raised Christ from the dead and gave him great glory .
60:1:022:0	You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth , so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters . Love each other deeply with all your heart .
60:1:023:0	For you have been born again , but not to a life that will quickly end . Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal , living word of God .
60:1:024:0	As the Scriptures say , “ People are like grass ; their beauty is like a flower in the field.The grass withers and the flower fades .
60:1:025:0	But the word of the Lord remains forever. ” And that word is the Good News that was preached to you .
