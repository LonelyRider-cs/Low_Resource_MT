60:3:001:1	Wives
60:3:001:0	In the same way , you wives must accept the authority of your husbands . Then , even if some refuse to obey the Good News , your godly lives will speak to them without any words . They will be won over
60:3:002:0	by observing your pure and reverent lives .
60:3:003:0	Do n't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles , expensive jewelry , or beautiful clothes .
60:3:004:0	You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within , the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is so precious to God .
60:3:005:0	This is how the holy women of old made themselves beautiful . They put their trust in God and accepted the authority of their husbands .
60:3:002:1	Husbands
60:3:006:0	For instance , Sarah obeyed her husband , Abraham , and called him her master . You are her daughters when you do what is right without fear of what your husbands might do .
60:3:003:1	All Christians
60:3:007:0	In the same way , you husbands must give honor to your wives . Treat your wife with understanding as you live together . She may be weaker than you are , but she is your equal partner in God 's gift of new life . Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered .
60:3:008:0	Finally , all of you should be of one mind . Sympathize with each other . Love each other as brothers and sisters . Be tenderhearted , and keep a humble attitude .
60:3:009:0	Do n't repay evil for evil . Do n't retaliate with insults when people insult you . Instead , pay them back with a blessing . That is what God has called you to do , and he will grant you his blessing .
60:3:010:0	For the Scriptures say , “ If you want to enjoy lifeand see many happy days , keep your tongue from speaking eviland your lips from telling lies .
60:3:011:0	Turn away from evil and do good.Search for peace , and work to maintain it .
60:3:004:1	Suffering for Doing Good
60:3:012:0	The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right , and his ears are open to their prayers.But the Lord turns his faceagainst those who do evil . ”
60:3:013:0	Now , who will want to harm you if you are eager to do good ?
60:3:014:0	But even if you suffer for doing what is right , God will reward you for it . So do n't worry or be afraid of their threats .
60:3:015:0	Instead , you must worship Christ as Lord of your life . And if someone asks about your hope as a believer , always be ready to explain it .
60:3:016:0	But do this in a gentle and respectful way . Keep your conscience clear . Then if people speak against you , they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ .
60:3:017:0	Remember , it is better to suffer for doing good , if that is what God wants , than to suffer for doing wrong !
60:3:018:0	Christ suffered for our sins once for all time . He never sinned , but he died for sinners to bring you safely home to God . He suffered physical death , but he was raised to life in the Spirit .
60:3:019:0	So he went and preached to the spirits in prison —
60:3:020:0	those who disobeyed God long ago when God waited patiently while Noah was building his boat . Only eight people were saved from drowning in that terrible flood .
60:3:021:0	And that water is a picture of baptism , which now saves you , not by removing dirt from your body , but as a response to God from a clean conscience . It is effective because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
60:3:022:0	Now Christ has gone to heaven . He is seated in the place of honor next to God , and all the angels and authorities and powers accept his authority .
