60:5:001:1	Advice for Elders and Young Men
60:5:001:0	And now , a word to you who are elders in the churches . I , too , am an elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ . And I , too , will share in his glory when he is revealed to the whole world . As a fellow elder , I appeal to you :
60:5:002:0	Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you . Watch over it willingly , not grudgingly — not for what you will get out of it , but because you are eager to serve God .
60:5:003:0	Do n't lord it over the people assigned to your care , but lead them by your own good example .
60:5:004:0	And when the Great Shepherd appears , you will receive a crown of never-ending glory and honor .
60:5:005:0	In the same way , you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders . And all of you , dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another , for “ God opposes the proudbut gives grace to the humble . ”
60:5:006:0	So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God , and at the right time he will lift you up in honor .
60:5:007:0	Give all your worries and cares to God , for he cares about you .
60:5:008:0	Stay alert ! Watch out for your great enemy , the devil . He prowls around like a roaring lion , looking for someone to devour .
60:5:009:0	Stand firm against him , and be strong in your faith . Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are .
60:5:010:0	In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus . So after you have suffered a little while , he will restore , support , and strengthen you , and he will place you on a firm foundation .
60:5:002:1	Peter 's Final Greetings

60:5:012:0	I have written and sent this short letter to you with the help of Silas , whom I commend to you as a faithful brother . My purpose in writing is to encourage you and assure you that what you are experiencing is truly part of God 's grace for you . Stand firm in this grace .
60:5:013:0	Your sister church here in Babylon sends you greetings , and so does my son Mark .
60:5:014:0	Greet each other with a kiss of love.Peace be with all of you who are in Christ .
