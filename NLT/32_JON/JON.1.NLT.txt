32:1:001:1	Jonah Runs from the
32:1:002:1	Lord
32:1:001:0	The Lord gave this message to Jonah son of Amittai :
32:1:002:0	“ Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh . Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are . ”
32:1:003:0	But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction to get away from the Lord . He went down to the port of Joppa , where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish . He bought a ticket and went on board , hoping to escape from the Lord by sailing to Tarshish .
32:1:004:0	But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea , causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart .
32:1:005:0	Fearing for their lives , the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship.But all this time Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold .
32:1:006:0	So the captain went down after him . “ How can you sleep at a time like this ? ” he shouted . “ Get up and pray to your god ! Maybe he will pay attention to us and spare our lives . ”
32:1:007:0	Then the crew cast lots to see which of them had offended the gods and caused the terrible storm . When they did this , the lots identified Jonah as the culprit .
32:1:008:0	“ Why has this awful storm come down on us ? ” they demanded . “ Who are you ? What is your line of work ? What country are you from ? What is your nationality ? ”
32:1:009:0	Jonah answered , “ I am a Hebrew , and I worship the Lord , the God of heaven , who made the sea and the land . ”
32:1:010:0	The sailors were terrified when they heard this , for he had already told them he was running away from the Lord . “ Oh , why did you do it ? ” they groaned .
32:1:011:0	And since the storm was getting worse all the time , they asked him , “ What should we do to you to stop this storm ? ”
32:1:012:0	“ Throw me into the sea , ” Jonah said , “ and it will become calm again . I know that this terrible storm is all my fault . ”
32:1:013:0	Instead , the sailors rowed even harder to get the ship to the land . But the stormy sea was too violent for them , and they could n't make it .
32:1:014:0	Then they cried out to the Lord , Jonah 's God . “ O Lord , ” they pleaded , “ do n't make us die for this man 's sin . And do n't hold us responsible for his death . O Lord , you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons . ”
32:1:015:0	Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea , and the storm stopped at once !
32:1:016:0	The sailors were awestruck by the Lord 's great power , and they offered him a sacrifice and vowed to serve him .
32:1:017:0	Now the Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah . And Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights .
