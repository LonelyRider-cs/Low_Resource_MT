32:4:001:1	Jonah 's Anger at the
32:4:002:1	Lord
32:4:003:1	's Mercy
32:4:001:0	This change of plans greatly upset Jonah , and he became very angry .
32:4:002:0	So he complained to the Lord about it : “ Did n't I say before I left home that you would do this , Lord ? That is why I ran away to Tarshish ! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God , slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love . You are eager to turn back from destroying people .
32:4:003:0	Just kill me now , Lord ! I 'd rather be dead than alive if what I predicted will not happen . ”
32:4:004:0	The Lord replied , “ Is it right for you to be angry about this ? ”
32:4:005:0	Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under as he waited to see what would happen to the city .
32:4:006:0	And the Lord God arranged for a leafy plant to grow there , and soon it spread its broad leaves over Jonah 's head , shading him from the sun . This eased his discomfort , and Jonah was very grateful for the plant .
32:4:007:0	But God also arranged for a worm ! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away .
32:4:008:0	And as the sun grew hot , God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah . The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die . “ Death is certainly better than living like this ! ” he exclaimed .
32:4:009:0	Then God said to Jonah , “ Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died ? ” “ Yes , ” Jonah retorted , “ even angry enough to die ! ”
32:4:010:0	Then the Lord said , “ You feel sorry about the plant , though you did nothing to put it there . It came quickly and died quickly .
32:4:011:0	But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness , not to mention all the animals . Should n't I feel sorry for such a great city ? ”
