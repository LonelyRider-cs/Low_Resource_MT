7:13:001:1	The Birth of Samson
7:13:001:0	Again the Israelites did evil in the Lord 's sight , so the Lord handed them over to the Philistines , who oppressed them for forty years .
7:13:002:0	In those days a man named Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah . His wife was unable to become pregnant , and they had no children .
7:13:003:0	The angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah 's wife and said , “ Even though you have been unable to have children , you will soon become pregnant and give birth to a son .
7:13:004:0	So be careful ; you must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food .
7:13:005:0	You will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and his hair must never be cut . For he will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from birth . He will begin to rescue Israel from the Philistines . ”
7:13:006:0	The woman ran and told her husband , “ A man of God appeared to me ! He looked like one of God 's angels , terrifying to see . I did n't ask where he was from , and he did n't tell me his name .
7:13:007:0	But he told me , ‘ You will become pregnant and give birth to a son . You must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food . For your son will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from the moment of his birth until the day of his death . ' ”
7:13:008:0	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord , saying , “ Lord , please let the man of God come back to us again and give us more instructions about this son who is to be born . ”
7:13:009:0	God answered Manoah 's prayer , and the angel of God appeared once again to his wife as she was sitting in the field . But her husband , Manoah , was not with her .
7:13:010:0	So she quickly ran and told her husband , “ The man who appeared to me the other day is here again ! ”
7:13:011:0	Manoah ran back with his wife and asked , “ Are you the man who spoke to my wife the other day ? ” “ Yes , ” he replied , “ I am . ”
7:13:012:0	So Manoah asked him , “ When your words come true , what kind of rules should govern the boy 's life and work ? ”
7:13:013:0	The angel of the Lord replied , “ Be sure your wife follows the instructions I gave her .
7:13:014:0	She must not eat grapes or raisins , drink wine or any other alcoholic drink , or eat any forbidden food . ”
7:13:015:0	Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ Please stay here until we can prepare a young goat for you to eat . ”
7:13:016:0	“ I will stay , ” the angel of the Lord replied , “ but I will not eat anything . However , you may prepare a burnt offering as a sacrifice to the Lord. ” ( Manoah did n't realize it was the angel of the Lord . )
7:13:017:0	Then Manoah asked the angel of the Lord , “ What is your name ? For when all this comes true , we want to honor you . ”
7:13:018:0	“ Why do you ask my name ? ” the angel of the Lord replied . “ It is too wonderful for you to understand . ”
7:13:019:0	Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered it on a rock as a sacrifice to the Lord . And as Manoah and his wife watched , the Lord did an amazing thing .
7:13:020:0	As the flames from the altar shot up toward the sky , the angel of the Lord ascended in the fire . When Manoah and his wife saw this , they fell with their faces to the ground .
7:13:021:0	The angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife . Manoah finally realized it was the angel of the Lord ,
7:13:022:0	and he said to his wife , “ We will certainly die , for we have seen God ! ”
7:13:023:0	But his wife said , “ If the Lord were going to kill us , he would n't have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering . He would n't have appeared to us and told us this wonderful thing and done these miracles . ”
7:13:024:0	When her son was born , she named him Samson . And the Lord blessed him as he grew up .
7:13:025:0	And the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him while he lived in Mahaneh-dan , which is located between the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol .
