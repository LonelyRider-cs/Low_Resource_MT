7:4:001:1	Deborah Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:4:001:0	After Ehud 's death , the Israelites again did evil in the Lord 's sight .
7:4:002:0	So the Lord turned them over to King Jabin of Hazor , a Canaanite king . The commander of his army was Sisera , who lived in Harosheth-haggoyim .
7:4:003:0	Sisera , who had 900 iron chariots , ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years . Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help .
7:4:004:0	Deborah , the wife of Lappidoth , was a prophet who was judging Israel at that time .
7:4:005:0	She would sit under the Palm of Deborah , between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim , and the Israelites would go to her for judgment .
7:4:006:0	One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam , who lived in Kedesh in the land of Naphtali . She said to him , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , commands you : Call out 10,000 warriors from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun at Mount Tabor .
7:4:007:0	And I will call out Sisera , commander of Jabin 's army , along with his chariots and warriors , to the Kishon River . There I will give you victory over him . ”
7:4:008:0	Barak told her , “ I will go , but only if you go with me . ”
7:4:009:0	“ Very well , ” she replied , “ I will go with you . But you will receive no honor in this venture , for the Lord 's victory over Sisera will be at the hands of a woman. ” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh .
7:4:010:0	At Kedesh , Barak called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali , and 10,000 warriors went up with him . Deborah also went with him .
7:4:011:0	Now Heber the Kenite , a descendant of Moses ' brother-in-law Hobab , had moved away from the other members of his tribe and pitched his tent by the oak of Zaanannim near Kedesh .
7:4:012:0	When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor ,
7:4:013:0	he called for all 900 of his iron chariots and all of his warriors , and they marched from Harosheth-haggoyim to the Kishon River .
7:4:014:0	Then Deborah said to Barak , “ Get ready ! This is the day the Lord will give you victory over Sisera , for the Lord is marching ahead of you. ” So Barak led his 10,000 warriors down the slopes of Mount Tabor into battle .
7:4:015:0	When Barak attacked , the Lord threw Sisera and all his chariots and warriors into a panic . Sisera leaped down from his chariot and escaped on foot .
7:4:016:0	Then Barak chased the chariots and the enemy army all the way to Harosheth-haggoyim , killing all of Sisera 's warriors . Not a single one was left alive .
7:4:017:0	Meanwhile , Sisera ran to the tent of Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , because Heber 's family was on friendly terms with King Jabin of Hazor .
7:4:018:0	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him , “ Come into my tent , sir . Come in . Do n't be afraid. ” So he went into her tent , and she covered him with a blanket .
7:4:019:0	“ Please give me some water , ” he said . “ I 'm thirsty. ” So she gave him some milk from a leather bag and covered him again .
7:4:020:0	“ Stand at the door of the tent , ” he told her . “ If anybody comes and asks you if there is anyone here , say no . ”
7:4:021:0	But when Sisera fell asleep from exhaustion , Jael quietly crept up to him with a hammer and tent peg in her hand . Then she drove the tent peg through his temple and into the ground , and so he died .
7:4:022:0	When Barak came looking for Sisera , Jael went out to meet him . She said , “ Come , and I will show you the man you are looking for. ” So he followed her into the tent and found Sisera lying there dead , with the tent peg through his temple .
7:4:023:0	So on that day Israel saw God defeat Jabin , the Canaanite king .
7:4:024:0	And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin until they finally destroyed him .
