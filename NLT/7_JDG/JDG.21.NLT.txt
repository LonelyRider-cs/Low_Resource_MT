7:21:001:1	Israel Provides Wives for Benjamin
7:21:001:0	The Israelites had vowed at Mizpah , “ We will never give our daughters in marriage to a man from the tribe of Benjamin . ”
7:21:002:0	Now the people went to Bethel and sat in the presence of God until evening , weeping loudly and bitterly .
7:21:003:0	“ O Lord , God of Israel , ” they cried out , “ why has this happened in Israel ? Now one of our tribes is missing from Israel ! ”
7:21:004:0	Early the next morning the people built an altar and presented their burnt offerings and peace offerings on it .
7:21:005:0	Then they said , “ Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we held our assembly in the presence of the Lord ? ” At that time they had taken a solemn oath in the Lord 's presence , vowing that anyone who refused to come would be put to death .
7:21:006:0	The Israelites felt sorry for their brother Benjamin and said , “ Today one of the tribes of Israel has been cut off .
7:21:007:0	How can we find wives for the few who remain , since we have sworn by the Lord not to give them our daughters in marriage ? ”
7:21:008:0	So they asked , “ Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we assembled in the presence of the Lord ? ” And they discovered that no one from Jabesh-gilead had attended the assembly .
7:21:009:0	For after they counted all the people , no one from Jabesh-gilead was present .
7:21:010:0	So the assembly sent 12,000 of their best warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there , including women and children .
7:21:011:0	“ This is what you are to do , ” they said . “ Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin . ”
7:21:012:0	Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found 400 young virgins who had never slept with a man , and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan .
7:21:013:0	The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the remaining people of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon .
7:21:014:0	Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes , and the 400 women of Jabesh-gilead who had been spared were given to them as wives . But there were not enough women for all of them .
7:21:015:0	The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the Lord had made this gap among the tribes of Israel .
7:21:016:0	So the elders of the assembly asked , “ How can we find wives for the few who remain , since the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead ?
7:21:017:0	There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel is not wiped out .
7:21:018:0	But we can not give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God 's curse . ”
7:21:019:0	Then they thought of the annual festival of the Lord held in Shiloh , south of Lebonah and north of Bethel , along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem .
7:21:020:0	They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives , “ Go and hide in the vineyards .
7:21:021:0	When you see the young women of Shiloh come out for their dances , rush out from the vineyards , and each of you can take one of them home to the land of Benjamin to be your wife !
7:21:022:0	And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest , we will tell them , ‘ Please be sympathetic . Let them have your daughters , for we did n't find wives for all of them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead . And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not actually give your daughters to them in marriage . ' ”
7:21:023:0	So the men of Benjamin did as they were told . Each man caught one of the women as she danced in the celebration and carried her off to be his wife . They returned to their own land , and they rebuilt their towns and lived in them .
7:21:024:0	Then the people of Israel departed by tribes and families , and they returned to their own homes .
7:21:025:0	In those days Israel had no king ; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes .
