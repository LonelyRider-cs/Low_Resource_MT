7:7:001:1	Gideon Defeats the Midianites
7:7:001:0	So Jerub-baal ( that is , Gideon ) and his army got up early and went as far as the spring of Harod . The armies of Midian were camped north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh .
7:7:002:0	The Lord said to Gideon , “ You have too many warriors with you . If I let all of you fight the Midianites , the Israelites will boast to me that they saved themselves by their own strength .
7:7:003:0	Therefore , tell the people , ‘ Whoever is timid or afraid may leave this mountain and go home . ' ” So 22,000 of them went home , leaving only 10,000 who were willing to fight .
7:7:004:0	But the Lord told Gideon , “ There are still too many ! Bring them down to the spring , and I will test them to determine who will go with you and who will not . ”
7:7:005:0	When Gideon took his warriors down to the water , the Lord told him , “ Divide the men into two groups . In one group put all those who cup water in their hands and lap it up with their tongues like dogs . In the other group put all those who kneel down and drink with their mouths in the stream . ”
7:7:006:0	Only 300 of the men drank from their hands . All the others got down on their knees and drank with their mouths in the stream .
7:7:007:0	The Lord told Gideon , “ With these 300 men I will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites . Send all the others home . ”
7:7:008:0	So Gideon collected the provisions and rams ' horns of the other warriors and sent them home . But he kept the 300 men with him.The Midianite camp was in the valley just below Gideon .
7:7:009:0	That night the Lord said , “ Get up ! Go down into the Midianite camp , for I have given you victory over them !
7:7:010:0	But if you are afraid to attack , go down to the camp with your servant Purah .
7:7:011:0	Listen to what the Midianites are saying , and you will be greatly encouraged . Then you will be eager to attack. ” So Gideon took Purah and went down to the edge of the enemy camp .
7:7:012:0	The armies of Midian , Amalek , and the people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts . Their camels were like grains of sand on the seashore — too many to count !
7:7:013:0	Gideon crept up just as a man was telling his companion about a dream . The man said , “ I had this dream , and in my dream a loaf of barley bread came tumbling down into the Midianite camp . It hit a tent , turned it over , and knocked it flat ! ”
7:7:014:0	His companion answered , “ Your dream can mean only one thing — God has given Gideon son of Joash , the Israelite , victory over Midian and all its allies ! ”
7:7:015:0	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation , he bowed in worship before the Lord . Then he returned to the Israelite camp and shouted , “ Get up ! For the Lord has given you victory over the Midianite hordes ! ”
7:7:016:0	He divided the 300 men into three groups and gave each man a ram 's horn and a clay jar with a torch in it .
7:7:017:0	Then he said to them , “ Keep your eyes on me . When I come to the edge of the camp , do just as I do .
7:7:018:0	As soon as I and those with me blow the rams ' horns , blow your horns , too , all around the entire camp , and shout , ‘ For the Lord and for Gideon ! ' ”
7:7:019:0	It was just after midnight , after the changing of the guard , when Gideon and the 100 men with him reached the edge of the Midianite camp . Suddenly , they blew the rams ' horns and broke their clay jars .
7:7:020:0	Then all three groups blew their horns and broke their jars . They held the blazing torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands , and they all shouted , “ A sword for the Lord and for Gideon ! ”
7:7:021:0	Each man stood at his position around the camp and watched as all the Midianites rushed around in a panic , shouting as they ran to escape .
7:7:022:0	When the 300 Israelites blew their rams ' horns , the Lord caused the warriors in the camp to fight against each other with their swords . Those who were not killed fled to places as far away as Beth-shittah near Zererah and to the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath .
7:7:023:0	Then Gideon sent for the warriors of Naphtali , Asher , and Manasseh , who joined in chasing the army of Midian .
7:7:024:0	Gideon also sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim , saying , “ Come down to attack the Midianites . Cut them off at the shallow crossings of the Jordan River at Beth-barah. ” So all the men of Ephraim did as they were told .
7:7:025:0	They captured Oreb and Zeeb , the two Midianite commanders , killing Oreb at the rock of Oreb , and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb . And they continued to chase the Midianites . Afterward the Israelites brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon , who was by the Jordan River .
