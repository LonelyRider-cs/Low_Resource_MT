7:19:001:1	The Levite and His Concubine
7:19:001:0	Now in those days Israel had no king . There was a man from the tribe of Levi living in a remote area of the hill country of Ephraim . One day he brought home a woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine .
7:19:002:0	But she became angry with him and returned to her father 's home in Bethlehem.After about four months ,
7:19:003:0	her husband set out for Bethlehem to speak personally to her and persuade her to come back . He took with him a servant and a pair of donkeys . When he arrived at her father 's house , her father saw him and welcomed him .
7:19:004:0	Her father urged him to stay awhile , so he stayed three days , eating , drinking , and sleeping there .
7:19:005:0	On the fourth day the man was up early , ready to leave , but the woman 's father said to his son-in-law , “ Have something to eat before you go . ”
7:19:006:0	So the two men sat down together and had something to eat and drink . Then the woman 's father said , “ Please stay another night and enjoy yourself . ”
7:19:007:0	The man got up to leave , but his father-in-law kept urging him to stay , so he finally gave in and stayed the night .
7:19:008:0	On the morning of the fifth day he was up early again , ready to leave , and again the woman 's father said , “ Have something to eat ; then you can leave later this afternoon. ” So they had another day of feasting .
7:19:009:0	Later , as the man and his concubine and servant were preparing to leave , his father-in-law said , “ Look , it 's almost evening . Stay the night and enjoy yourself . Tomorrow you can get up early and be on your way . ”
7:19:010:0	But this time the man was determined to leave . So he took his two saddled donkeys and his concubine and headed in the direction of Jebus ( that is , Jerusalem ) .
7:19:011:0	It was late in the day when they neared Jebus , and the man 's servant said to him , “ Let 's stop at this Jebusite town and spend the night there . ”
7:19:012:0	“ No , ” his master said , “ we ca n't stay in this foreign town where there are no Israelites . Instead , we will go on to Gibeah .
7:19:013:0	Come on , let 's try to get as far as Gibeah or Ramah , and we 'll spend the night in one of those towns . ”
7:19:014:0	So they went on . The sun was setting as they came to Gibeah , a town in the land of Benjamin ,
7:19:015:0	so they stopped there to spend the night . They rested in the town square , but no one took them in for the night .
7:19:016:0	That evening an old man came home from his work in the fields . He was from the hill country of Ephraim , but he was living in Gibeah , where the people were from the tribe of Benjamin .
7:19:017:0	When he saw the travelers sitting in the town square , he asked them where they were from and where they were going .
7:19:018:0	“ We have been in Bethlehem in Judah , ” the man replied . “ We are on our way to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim , which is my home . I traveled to Bethlehem , and now I 'm returning home . But no one has taken us in for the night ,
7:19:019:0	even though we have everything we need . We have straw and feed for our donkeys and plenty of bread and wine for ourselves . ”
7:19:020:0	“ You are welcome to stay with me , ” the old man said . “ I will give you anything you might need . But whatever you do , do n't spend the night in the square . ”
7:19:021:0	So he took them home with him and fed the donkeys . After they washed their feet , they ate and drank together .
7:19:022:0	While they were enjoying themselves , a crowd of troublemakers from the town surrounded the house . They began beating at the door and shouting to the old man , “ Bring out the man who is staying with you so we can have sex with him . ”
7:19:023:0	The old man stepped outside to talk to them . “ No , my brothers , do n't do such an evil thing . For this man is a guest in my house , and such a thing would be shameful .
7:19:024:0	Here , take my virgin daughter and this man 's concubine . I will bring them out to you , and you can abuse them and do whatever you like . But do n't do such a shameful thing to this man . ”
7:19:025:0	But they would n't listen to him . So the Levite took hold of his concubine and pushed her out the door . The men of the town abused her all night , taking turns raping her until morning . Finally , at dawn they let her go .
7:19:026:0	At daybreak the woman returned to the house where her husband was staying . She collapsed at the door of the house and lay there until it was light .
7:19:027:0	When her husband opened the door to leave , there lay his concubine with her hands on the threshold .
7:19:028:0	He said , “ Get up ! Let 's go ! ” But there was no answer . So he put her body on his donkey and took her home .
7:19:029:0	When he got home , he took a knife and cut his concubine 's body into twelve pieces . Then he sent one piece to each tribe throughout all the territory of Israel .
7:19:030:0	Everyone who saw it said , “ Such a horrible crime has not been committed in all the time since Israel left Egypt . Think about it ! What are we going to do ? Who 's going to speak up ? ”
