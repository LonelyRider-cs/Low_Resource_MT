7:10:001:1	Tola Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:10:001:0	After Abimelech died , Tola son of Puah , son of Dodo , was the next person to rescue Israel . He was from the tribe of Issachar but lived in the town of Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim .
7:10:002:1	Jair Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:10:002:0	He judged Israel for twenty-three years . When he died , he was buried in Shamir .
7:10:003:0	After Tola died , Jair from Gilead judged Israel for twenty-two years .
7:10:004:0	His thirty sons rode around on thirty donkeys , and they owned thirty towns in the land of Gilead , which are still called the Towns of Jair .
7:10:003:1	The Ammonites Oppress Israel
7:10:005:0	When Jair died , he was buried in Kamon .
7:10:006:0	Again the Israelites did evil in the Lord 's sight . They served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth , and the gods of Aram , Sidon , Moab , Ammon , and Philistia . They abandoned the Lord and no longer served him at all .
7:10:007:0	So the Lord burned with anger against Israel , and he turned them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites ,
7:10:008:0	who began to oppress them that year . For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites ( that is , in Gilead ) .
7:10:009:0	The Ammonites also crossed to the west side of the Jordan and attacked Judah , Benjamin , and Ephraim.The Israelites were in great distress .
7:10:010:0	Finally , they cried out to the Lord for help , saying , “ We have sinned against you because we have abandoned you as our God and have served the images of Baal . ”
7:10:011:0	The Lord replied , “ Did I not rescue you from the Egyptians , the Amorites , the Ammonites , the Philistines ,
7:10:012:0	the Sidonians , the Amalekites , and the Maonites ? When they oppressed you , you cried out to me for help , and I rescued you .
7:10:013:0	Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods . So I will not rescue you anymore .
7:10:014:0	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen ! Let them rescue you in your hour of distress ! ”
7:10:015:0	But the Israelites pleaded with the Lord and said , “ We have sinned . Punish us as you see fit , only rescue us today from our enemies . ”
7:10:016:0	Then the Israelites put aside their foreign gods and served the Lord . And he was grieved by their misery .
7:10:017:0	At that time the armies of Ammon had gathered for war and were camped in Gilead , and the people of Israel assembled and camped at Mizpah .
7:10:018:0	The leaders of Gilead said to each other , “ Whoever attacks the Ammonites first will become ruler over all the people of Gilead . ”
