7:9:001:1	Abimelech Rules over Shechem
7:9:001:0	One day Gideon 's son Abimelech went to Shechem to visit his uncles—his mother 's brothers . He said to them and to the rest of his mother 's family ,
7:9:002:0	“ Ask the leading citizens of Shechem whether they want to be ruled by all seventy of Gideon 's sons or by one man . And remember that I am your own flesh and blood ! ”
7:9:003:0	So Abimelech 's uncles gave his message to all the citizens of Shechem on his behalf . And after listening to this proposal , the people of Shechem decided in favor of Abimelech because he was their relative .
7:9:004:0	They gave him seventy silver coins from the temple of Baal-berith , which he used to hire some reckless troublemakers who agreed to follow him .
7:9:005:0	He went to his father 's home at Ophrah , and there , on one stone , they killed all seventy of his half brothers , the sons of Gideon . But the youngest brother , Jotham , escaped and hid .
7:9:002:1	Jotham 's Parable
7:9:006:0	Then all the leading citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo called a meeting under the oak beside the pillar at Shechem and made Abimelech their king .
7:9:007:0	When Jotham heard about this , he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted , “ Listen to me , citizens of Shechem ! Listen to me if you want God to listen to you !
7:9:008:0	Once upon a time the trees decided to choose a king.First they said to the olive tree , ‘ Be our king ! '
7:9:009:0	But the olive tree refused , saying , ‘ Should I quit producing the olive oilthat blesses both God and people , just to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
7:9:010:0	“ Then they said to the fig tree , ‘ You be our king ! '
7:9:011:0	But the fig tree also refused , saying , ‘ Should I quit producing my sweet fruitjust to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
7:9:012:0	“ Then they said to the grapevine , ‘ You be our king ! '
7:9:013:0	But the grapevine also refused , saying , ‘ Should I quit producing the winethat cheers both God and people , just to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
7:9:014:0	“ Then all the trees finally turned to the thornbush and said , ‘ Come , you be our king ! '
7:9:015:0	And the thornbush replied to the trees , ‘ If you truly want to make me your king , come and take shelter in my shade.If not , let fire come out from meand devour the cedars of Lebanon . ' ”
7:9:016:0	Jotham continued , “ Now make sure you have acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelech your king , and that you have done right by Gideon and all of his descendants . Have you treated him with the honor he deserves for all he accomplished ?
7:9:017:0	For he fought for you and risked his life when he rescued you from the Midianites .
7:9:018:0	But today you have revolted against my father and his descendants , killing his seventy sons on one stone . And you have chosen his slave woman 's son , Abimelech , to be your king just because he is your relative .
7:9:019:0	“ If you have acted honorably and in good faith toward Gideon and his descendants today , then may you find joy in Abimelech , and may he find joy in you .
7:9:020:0	But if you have not acted in good faith , then may fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leading citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo ; and may fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo and devour Abimelech ! ”
7:9:003:1	Shechem Rebels against Abimelech
7:9:021:0	Then Jotham escaped and lived in Beer because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech .
7:9:022:0	After Abimelech had ruled over Israel for three years ,
7:9:023:0	God sent a spirit that stirred up trouble between Abimelech and the leading citizens of Shechem , and they revolted .
7:9:024:0	God was punishing Abimelech for murdering Gideon 's seventy sons , and the citizens of Shechem for supporting him in this treachery of murdering his brothers .
7:9:025:0	The citizens of Shechem set an ambush for Abimelech on the hilltops and robbed everyone who passed that way . But someone warned Abimelech about their plot .
7:9:026:0	One day Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem with his brothers and gained the confidence of the leading citizens of Shechem .
7:9:027:0	During the annual harvest festival at Shechem , held in the temple of the local god , the wine flowed freely , and everyone began cursing Abimelech .
7:9:028:0	“ Who is Abimelech ? ” Gaal shouted . “ He 's not a true son of Shechem , so why should we be his servants ? He 's merely the son of Gideon , and this Zebul is merely his deputy . Serve the true sons of Hamor , the founder of Shechem . Why should we serve Abimelech ?
7:9:029:0	If I were in charge here , I would get rid of Abimelech . I would say to him , ‘ Get some soldiers , and come out and fight ! ' ”
7:9:030:0	But when Zebul , the leader of the city , heard what Gaal was saying , he was furious .
7:9:031:0	He sent messengers to Abimelech in Arumah , telling him , “ Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to live in Shechem , and now they are inciting the city to rebel against you .
7:9:032:0	Come by night with an army and hide out in the fields .
7:9:033:0	In the morning , as soon as it is daylight , attack the city . When Gaal and those who are with him come out against you , you can do with them as you wish . ”
7:9:034:0	So Abimelech and all his men went by night and split into four groups , stationing themselves around Shechem .
7:9:035:0	Gaal was standing at the city gates when Abimelech and his army came out of hiding .
7:9:036:0	When Gaal saw them , he said to Zebul , “ Look , there are people coming down from the hilltops ! ” Zebul replied , “ It 's just the shadows on the hills that look like men . ”
7:9:037:0	But again Gaal said , “ No , people are coming down from the hills . And another group is coming down the road past the Diviners ' Oak . ”
7:9:038:0	Then Zebul turned on him and asked , “ Now where is that big mouth of yours ? Was n't it you that said , ‘ Who is Abimelech , and why should we be his servants ? ' The men you mocked are right outside the city ! Go out and fight them ! ”
7:9:039:0	So Gaal led the leading citizens of Shechem into battle against Abimelech .
7:9:040:0	But Abimelech chased him , and many of Shechem 's men were wounded and fell along the road as they retreated to the city gate .
7:9:041:0	Abimelech returned to Arumah , and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem .
7:9:042:0	The next day the people of Shechem went out into the fields to battle . When Abimelech heard about it ,
7:9:043:0	he divided his men into three groups and set an ambush in the fields . When Abimelech saw the people coming out of the city , he and his men jumped up from their hiding places and attacked them .
7:9:044:0	Abimelech and his group stormed the city gate to keep the men of Shechem from getting back in , while Abimelech 's other two groups cut them down in the fields .
7:9:045:0	The battle went on all day before Abimelech finally captured the city . He killed the people , leveled the city , and scattered salt all over the ground .
7:9:046:0	When the leading citizens who lived in the tower of Shechem heard what had happened , they ran and hid in the temple of Baal-berith .
7:9:047:0	Someone reported to Abimelech that the citizens had gathered in the temple ,
7:9:048:0	so he led his forces to Mount Zalmon . He took an ax and chopped some branches from a tree , then put them on his shoulder . “ Quick , do as I have done ! ” he told his men .
7:9:049:0	So each of them cut down some branches , following Abimelech 's example . They piled the branches against the walls of the temple and set them on fire . So all the people who had lived in the tower of Shechem died—about 1,000 men and women .
7:9:050:0	Then Abimelech attacked the town of Thebez and captured it .
7:9:051:0	But there was a strong tower inside the town , and all the men and women—the entire population—fled to it . They barricaded themselves in and climbed up to the roof of the tower .
7:9:052:0	Abimelech followed them to attack the tower . But as he prepared to set fire to the entrance ,
7:9:053:0	a woman on the roof dropped a millstone that landed on Abimelech 's head and crushed his skull .
7:9:054:0	He quickly said to his young armor bearer , “ Draw your sword and kill me ! Do n't let it be said that a woman killed Abimelech ! ” So the young man ran him through with his sword , and he died .
7:9:055:0	When Abimelech 's men saw that he was dead , they disbanded and returned to their homes .
7:9:056:0	In this way , God punished Abimelech for the evil he had done against his father by murdering his seventy brothers .
7:9:057:0	God also punished the men of Shechem for all their evil . So the curse of Jotham son of Gideon was fulfilled .
