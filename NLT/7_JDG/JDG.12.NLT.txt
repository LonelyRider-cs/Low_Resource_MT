7:12:001:1	Ephraim Fights with Jephthah
7:12:001:0	Then the people of Ephraim mobilized an army and crossed over the Jordan River to Zaphon . They sent this message to Jephthah : “ Why did n't you call for us to help you fight against the Ammonites ? We are going to burn down your house with you in it ! ”
7:12:002:0	Jephthah replied , “ I summoned you at the beginning of the dispute , but you refused to come ! You failed to help us in our struggle against Ammon .
7:12:003:0	So when I realized you were n't coming , I risked my life and went to battle without you , and the Lord gave me victory over the Ammonites . So why have you now come to fight me ? ”
7:12:004:0	The people of Ephraim responded , “ You men of Gilead are nothing more than fugitives from Ephraim and Manasseh. ” So Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and attacked the men of Ephraim and defeated them .
7:12:005:0	Jephthah captured the shallow crossings of the Jordan River , and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim tried to go back across , the men of Gilead would challenge him . “ Are you a member of the tribe of Ephraim ? ” they would ask . If the man said , “ No , I 'm not , ”
7:12:006:0	they would tell him to say “ Shibboleth. ” If he was from Ephraim , he would say “ Sibboleth , ” because people from Ephraim can not pronounce the word correctly . Then they would take him and kill him at the shallow crossings of the Jordan . In all , 42,000 Ephraimites were killed at that time .
