7:18:001:1	Idolatry in the Tribe of Dan
7:18:001:0	Now in those days Israel had no king . And the tribe of Dan was trying to find a place where they could settle , for they had not yet moved into the land assigned to them when the land was divided among the tribes of Israel .
7:18:002:0	So the men of Dan chose from their clans five capable warriors from the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol to scout out a land for them to settle in.When these warriors arrived in the hill country of Ephraim , they came to Micah 's house and spent the night there .
7:18:003:0	While at Micah 's house , they recognized the young Levite 's accent , so they went over and asked him , “ Who brought you here , and what are you doing in this place ? Why are you here ? ”
7:18:004:0	He told them about his agreement with Micah and that he had been hired as Micah 's personal priest .
7:18:005:0	Then they said , “ Ask God whether or not our journey will be successful . ”
7:18:006:0	“ Go in peace , ” the priest replied . “ For the Lord is watching over your journey . ”
7:18:007:0	So the five men went on to the town of Laish , where they noticed the people living carefree lives , like the Sidonians ; they were peaceful and secure . The people were also wealthy because their land was very fertile . And they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby .
7:18:008:0	When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol , their relatives asked them , “ What did you find ? ”
7:18:009:0	The men replied , “ Come on , let 's attack them ! We have seen the land , and it is very good . What are you waiting for ? Do n't hesitate to go and take possession of it .
7:18:010:0	When you get there , you will find the people living carefree lives . God has given us a spacious and fertile land , lacking in nothing ! ”
7:18:011:0	So 600 men from the tribe of Dan , armed with weapons of war , set out from Zorah and Eshtaol .
7:18:012:0	They camped at a place west of Kiriath-jearim in Judah , which is called Mahaneh-dan to this day .
7:18:013:0	Then they went on from there into the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah .
7:18:014:0	The five men who had scouted out the land around Laish explained to the others , “ These buildings contain a sacred ephod , as well as some household idols , a carved image , and a cast idol . What do you think you should do ? ”
7:18:015:0	Then the five men turned off the road and went over to Micah 's house , where the young Levite lived , and greeted him kindly .
7:18:016:0	As the 600 armed warriors from the tribe of Dan stood at the entrance of the gate ,
7:18:017:0	the five scouts entered the shrine and removed the carved image , the sacred ephod , the household idols , and the cast idol . Meanwhile , the priest was standing at the gate with the 600 armed warriors .
7:18:018:0	When the priest saw the men carrying all the sacred objects out of Micah 's shrine , he said , “ What are you doing ? ”
7:18:019:0	“ Be quiet and come with us , ” they said . “ Be a father and priest to all of us . Is n't it better to be a priest for an entire tribe and clan of Israel than for the household of just one man ? ”
7:18:020:0	The young priest was quite happy to go with them , so he took along the sacred ephod , the household idols , and the carved image .
7:18:021:0	They turned and started on their way again , placing their children , livestock , and possessions in front of them .
7:18:022:0	When the people from the tribe of Dan were quite a distance from Micah 's house , the people who lived near Micah came chasing after them .
7:18:023:0	They were shouting as they caught up with them . The men of Dan turned around and said to Micah , “ What 's the matter ? Why have you called these men together and chased after us like this ? ”
7:18:024:0	“ What do you mean , ‘ What 's the matter ? ' ” Micah replied . “ You 've taken away all the gods I have made , and my priest , and I have nothing left ! ”
7:18:025:0	The men of Dan said , “ Watch what you say ! There are some short-tempered men around here who might get angry and kill you and your family . ”
7:18:026:0	So the men of Dan continued on their way . When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to attack , he turned around and went home .
7:18:027:0	Then , with Micah 's idols and his priest , the men of Dan came to the town of Laish , whose people were peaceful and secure . They attacked with swords and burned the town to the ground .
7:18:028:0	There was no one to rescue the people , for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby . This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob.Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there .
7:18:029:0	They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor , Israel 's son , but it had originally been called Laish .
7:18:030:0	Then they set up the carved image , and they appointed Jonathan son of Gershom , son of Moses , as their priest . This family continued as priests for the tribe of Dan until the Exile .
7:18:031:0	So Micah 's carved image was worshiped by the tribe of Dan as long as the Tabernacle of God remained at Shiloh .
