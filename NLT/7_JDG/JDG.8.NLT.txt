7:8:001:1	Gideon Kills Zebah and Zalmunna
7:8:001:0	Then the people of Ephraim asked Gideon , “ Why have you treated us this way ? Why did n't you send for us when you first went out to fight the Midianites ? ” And they argued heatedly with Gideon .
7:8:002:0	But Gideon replied , “ What have I accomplished compared to you ? Are n't even the leftover grapes of Ephraim 's harvest better than the entire crop of my little clan of Abiezer ?
7:8:003:0	God gave you victory over Oreb and Zeeb , the commanders of the Midianite army . What have I accomplished compared to that ? ” When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon 's answer , their anger subsided .
7:8:004:0	Gideon then crossed the Jordan River with his 300 men , and though exhausted , they continued to chase the enemy .
7:8:005:0	When they reached Succoth , Gideon asked the leaders of the town , “ Please give my warriors some food . They are very tired . I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian . ”
7:8:006:0	But the officials of Succoth replied , “ Catch Zebah and Zalmunna first , and then we will feed your army . ”
7:8:007:0	So Gideon said , “ After the Lord gives me victory over Zebah and Zalmunna , I will return and tear your flesh with the thorns and briers from the wilderness . ”
7:8:008:0	From there Gideon went up to Peniel and again asked for food , but he got the same answer .
7:8:009:0	So he said to the people of Peniel , “ After I return in victory , I will tear down this tower . ”
7:8:010:0	By this time Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 warriors—all that remained of the allied armies of the east , for 120,000 had already been killed .
7:8:011:0	Gideon circled around by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah , taking the Midianite army by surprise .
7:8:012:0	Zebah and Zalmunna , the two Midianite kings , fled , but Gideon chased them down and captured all their warriors .
7:8:013:0	After this , Gideon returned from the battle by way of Heres Pass .
7:8:014:0	There he captured a young man from Succoth and demanded that he write down the names of all the seventy-seven officials and elders in the town .
7:8:015:0	Gideon then returned to Succoth and said to the leaders , “ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna . When we were here before , you taunted me , saying , ‘ Catch Zebah and Zalmunna first , and then we will feed your exhausted army . ' ”
7:8:016:0	Then Gideon took the elders of the town and taught them a lesson , punishing them with thorns and briers from the wilderness .
7:8:017:0	He also tore down the tower of Peniel and killed all the men in the town .
7:8:018:0	Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna , “ The men you killed at Tabor—what were they like ? ” “ Like you , ” they replied . “ They all had the look of a king 's son . ”
7:8:019:0	“ They were my brothers , the sons of my own mother ! ” Gideon exclaimed . “ As surely as the Lord lives , I would n't kill you if you had n't killed them . ”
7:8:020:0	Turning to Jether , his oldest son , he said , “ Kill them ! ” But Jether did not draw his sword , for he was only a boy and was afraid .
7:8:002:1	Gideon 's Sacred Ephod
7:8:021:0	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon , “ Be a man ! Kill us yourself ! ” So Gideon killed them both and took the royal ornaments from the necks of their camels .
7:8:022:0	Then the Israelites said to Gideon , “ Be our ruler ! You and your son and your grandson will be our rulers , for you have rescued us from Midian . ”
7:8:023:0	But Gideon replied , “ I will not rule over you , nor will my son . The Lord will rule over you !
7:8:024:0	However , I do have one request—that each of you give me an earring from the plunder you collected from your fallen enemies. ” ( The enemies , being Ishmaelites , all wore gold earrings . )
7:8:025:0	“ Gladly ! ” they replied . They spread out a cloak , and each one threw in a gold earring he had gathered from the plunder .
7:8:026:0	The weight of the gold earrings was forty-three pounds , not including the royal ornaments and pendants , the purple clothing worn by the kings of Midian , or the chains around the necks of their camels .
7:8:027:0	Gideon made a sacred ephod from the gold and put it in Ophrah , his hometown . But soon all the Israelites prostituted themselves by worshiping it , and it became a trap for Gideon and his family .
7:8:028:0	That is the story of how the people of Israel defeated Midian , which never recovered . Throughout the rest of Gideon 's lifetime—about forty years—there was peace in the land .
7:8:029:0	Then Gideon son of Joash returned home .
7:8:030:0	He had seventy sons born to him , for he had many wives .
7:8:031:0	He also had a concubine in Shechem , who gave birth to a son , whom he named Abimelech .
7:8:032:0	Gideon died when he was very old , and he was buried in the grave of his father , Joash , at Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer .
7:8:033:0	As soon as Gideon died , the Israelites prostituted themselves by worshiping the images of Baal , making Baal-berith their god .
7:8:034:0	They forgot the Lord their God , who had rescued them from all their enemies surrounding them .
7:8:035:0	Nor did they show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-baal ( that is , Gideon ) , despite all the good he had done for Israel .
