7:3:001:1	The Nations Left in Canaan
7:3:001:0	These are the nations that the Lord left in the land to test those Israelites who had not experienced the wars of Canaan .
7:3:002:0	He did this to teach warfare to generations of Israelites who had no experience in battle .
7:3:003:0	These are the nations : the Philistines ( those living under the five Philistine rulers ) , all the Canaanites , the Sidonians , and the Hivites living in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath .
7:3:004:0	These people were left to test the Israelites—to see whether they would obey the commands the Lord had given to their ancestors through Moses .
7:3:005:0	So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites ,
7:3:002:1	Othniel Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:3:006:0	and they intermarried with them . Israelite sons married their daughters , and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons . And the Israelites served their gods .
7:3:007:0	The Israelites did evil in the Lord 's sight . They forgot about the Lord their God , and they served the images of Baal and the Asherah poles .
7:3:008:0	Then the Lord burned with anger against Israel , and he turned them over to King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim . And the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years .
7:3:009:0	But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help , the Lord raised up a rescuer to save them . His name was Othniel , the son of Caleb 's younger brother , Kenaz .
7:3:010:0	The Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he became Israel 's judge . He went to war against King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram , and the Lord gave Othniel victory over him .
7:3:003:1	Ehud Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:3:011:0	So there was peace in the land for forty years . Then Othniel son of Kenaz died .
7:3:012:0	Once again the Israelites did evil in the Lord 's sight , and the Lord gave King Eglon of Moab control over Israel because of their evil .
7:3:013:0	Eglon enlisted the Ammonites and Amalekites as allies , and then he went out and defeated Israel , taking possession of Jericho , the city of palms .
7:3:014:0	And the Israelites served Eglon of Moab for eighteen years .
7:3:015:0	But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help , the Lord again raised up a rescuer to save them . His name was Ehud son of Gera , a left-handed man of the tribe of Benjamin . The Israelites sent Ehud to deliver their tribute money to King Eglon of Moab .
7:3:016:0	So Ehud made a double-edged dagger that was about a foot long , and he strapped it to his right thigh , keeping it hidden under his clothing .
7:3:017:0	He brought the tribute money to Eglon , who was very fat .
7:3:018:0	After delivering the payment , Ehud started home with those who had helped carry the tribute .
7:3:019:0	But when Ehud reached the stone idols near Gilgal , he turned back . He came to Eglon and said , “ I have a secret message for you. ” So the king commanded his servants , “ Be quiet ! ” and he sent them all out of the room .
7:3:020:0	Ehud walked over to Eglon , who was sitting alone in a cool upstairs room . And Ehud said , “ I have a message from God for you ! ” As King Eglon rose from his seat ,
7:3:021:0	Ehud reached with his left hand , pulled out the dagger strapped to his right thigh , and plunged it into the king 's belly .
7:3:022:0	The dagger went so deep that the handle disappeared beneath the king 's fat . So Ehud did not pull out the dagger , and the king 's bowels emptied .
7:3:023:0	Then Ehud closed and locked the doors of the room and escaped down the latrine .
7:3:024:0	After Ehud was gone , the king 's servants returned and found the doors to the upstairs room locked . They thought he might be using the latrine in the room ,
7:3:025:0	so they waited . But when the king did n't come out after a long delay , they became concerned and got a key . And when they opened the doors , they found their master dead on the floor .
7:3:026:0	While the servants were waiting , Ehud escaped , passing the stone idols on his way to Seirah .
7:3:027:0	When he arrived in the hill country of Ephraim , Ehud sounded a call to arms . Then he led a band of Israelites down from the hills .
7:3:028:0	“ Follow me , ” he said , “ for the Lord has given you victory over Moab your enemy. ” So they followed him . And the Israelites took control of the shallow crossings of the Jordan River across from Moab , preventing anyone from crossing .
7:3:029:0	They attacked the Moabites and killed about 10,000 of their strongest and most able-bodied warriors . Not one of them escaped .
7:3:004:1	Shamgar Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:3:030:0	So Moab was conquered by Israel that day , and there was peace in the land for eighty years .
7:3:031:0	After Ehud , Shamgar son of Anath rescued Israel . He once killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad .
