7:11:001:1	Jephthah Becomes Israel 's Judge
7:11:001:0	Now Jephthah of Gilead was a great warrior . He was the son of Gilead , but his mother was a prostitute .
7:11:002:0	Gilead 's wife also had several sons , and when these half brothers grew up , they chased Jephthah off the land . “ You will not get any of our father 's inheritance , ” they said , “ for you are the son of a prostitute . ”
7:11:003:0	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob . Soon he had a band of worthless rebels following him .
7:11:004:0	At about this time , the Ammonites began their war against Israel .
7:11:005:0	When the Ammonites attacked , the elders of Gilead sent for Jephthah in the land of Tob .
7:11:006:0	The elders said , “ Come and be our commander ! Help us fight the Ammonites ! ”
7:11:007:0	But Jephthah said to them , “ Are n't you the ones who hated me and drove me from my father 's house ? Why do you come to me now when you 're in trouble ? ”
7:11:008:0	“ Because we need you , ” the elders replied . “ If you lead us in battle against the Ammonites , we will make you ruler over all the people of Gilead . ”
7:11:009:0	Jephthah said to the elders , “ Let me get this straight . If I come with you and if the Lord gives me victory over the Ammonites , will you really make me ruler over all the people ? ”
7:11:010:0	“ The Lord is our witness , ” the elders replied . “ We promise to do whatever you say . ”
7:11:011:0	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him their ruler and commander of the army . At Mizpah , in the presence of the Lord , Jephthah repeated what he had said to the elders .
7:11:012:0	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon , asking , “ Why have you come out to fight against my land ? ”
7:11:013:0	The king of Ammon answered Jephthah 's messengers , “ When the Israelites came out of Egypt , they stole my land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and all the way to the Jordan . Now then , give back the land peaceably . ”
7:11:014:0	Jephthah sent this message back to the Ammonite king :
7:11:015:0	“ This is what Jephthah says : Israel did not steal any land from Moab or Ammon .
7:11:016:0	When the people of Israel arrived at Kadesh on their journey from Egypt after crossing the Red Sea ,
7:11:017:0	they sent messengers to the king of Edom asking for permission to pass through his land . But their request was denied . Then they asked the king of Moab for similar permission , but he would n't let them pass through either . So the people of Israel stayed in Kadesh .
7:11:018:0	“ Finally , they went around Edom and Moab through the wilderness . They traveled along Moab 's eastern border and camped on the other side of the Arnon River . But they never once crossed the Arnon River into Moab , for the Arnon was the border of Moab .
7:11:019:0	“ Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites , who ruled from Heshbon , asking for permission to cross through his land to get to their destination .
7:11:020:0	But King Sihon did n't trust Israel to pass through his land . Instead , he mobilized his army at Jahaz and attacked them .
7:11:021:0	But the Lord , the God of Israel , gave his people victory over King Sihon . So Israel took control of all the land of the Amorites , who lived in that region ,
7:11:022:0	from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River , and from the eastern wilderness to the Jordan .
7:11:023:0	“ So you see , it was the Lord , the God of Israel , who took away the land from the Amorites and gave it to Israel . Why , then , should we give it back to you ?
7:11:024:0	You keep whatever your god Chemosh gives you , and we will keep whatever the Lord our God gives us .
7:11:025:0	Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he try to make a case against Israel for disputed land ? Did he go to war against them ?
7:11:026:0	“ Israel has been living here for 300 years , inhabiting Heshbon and its surrounding settlements , all the way to Aroer and its settlements , and in all the towns along the Arnon River . Why have you made no effort to recover it before now ?
7:11:027:0	Therefore , I have not sinned against you . Rather , you have wronged me by attacking me . Let the Lord , who is judge , decide today which of us is right — Israel or Ammon . ”
7:11:002:1	Jephthah 's Vow
7:11:028:0	But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah 's message .
7:11:029:0	At that time the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he went throughout the land of Gilead and Manasseh , including Mizpah in Gilead , and from there he led an army against the Ammonites .
7:11:030:0	And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord . He said , “ If you give me victory over the Ammonites ,
7:11:031:0	I will give to the Lord whatever comes out of my house to meet me when I return in triumph . I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering . ”
7:11:032:0	So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites , and the Lord gave him victory .
7:11:033:0	He crushed the Ammonites , devastating about twenty towns from Aroer to an area near Minnith and as far away as Abel-keramim . In this way Israel defeated the Ammonites .
7:11:034:0	When Jephthah returned home to Mizpah , his daughter came out to meet him , playing on a tambourine and dancing for joy . She was his one and only child ; he had no other sons or daughters .
7:11:035:0	When he saw her , he tore his clothes in anguish . “ Oh , my daughter ! ” he cried out . “ You have completely destroyed me ! You 've brought disaster on me ! For I have made a vow to the Lord , and I can not take it back . ”
7:11:036:0	And she said , “ Father , if you have made a vow to the Lord , you must do to me what you have vowed , for the Lord has given you a great victory over your enemies , the Ammonites .
7:11:037:0	But first let me do this one thing : Let me go up and roam in the hills and weep with my friends for two months , because I will die a virgin . ”
7:11:038:0	“ You may go , ” Jephthah said . And he sent her away for two months . She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never have children .
7:11:039:0	When she returned home , her father kept the vow he had made , and she died a virgin.So it has become a custom in Israel
7:11:040:0	for young Israelite women to go away for four days each year to lament the fate of Jephthah 's daughter .
