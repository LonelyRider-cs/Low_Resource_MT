7:2:001:1	The
7:2:002:1	Lord
7:2:003:1	's Messenger Comes to Bokim
7:2:001:0	The angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said to the Israelites , “ I brought you out of Egypt into this land that I swore to give your ancestors , and I said I would never break my covenant with you .
7:2:002:0	For your part , you were not to make any covenants with the people living in this land ; instead , you were to destroy their altars . But you disobeyed my command . Why did you do this ?
7:2:003:0	So now I declare that I will no longer drive out the people living in your land . They will be thorns in your sides , and their gods will be a constant temptation to you . ”
7:2:004:0	When the angel of the Lord finished speaking to all the Israelites , the people wept loudly .
7:2:004:1	The Death of Joshua
7:2:005:0	So they called the place Bokim ( which means “ weeping ” ) , and they offered sacrifices there to the Lord .
7:2:006:0	After Joshua sent the people away , each of the tribes left to take possession of the land allotted to them .
7:2:007:0	And the Israelites served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and the leaders who outlived him—those who had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel .
7:2:008:0	Joshua son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died at the age of 110 .
7:2:005:1	Israel Disobeys the
7:2:006:1	Lord
7:2:009:0	They buried him in the land he had been allocated , at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim , north of Mount Gaash .
7:2:010:0	After that generation died , another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the Lord or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel .
7:2:011:0	The Israelites did evil in the Lord 's sight and served the images of Baal .
7:2:012:0	They abandoned the Lord , the God of their ancestors , who had brought them out of Egypt . They went after other gods , worshiping the gods of the people around them . And they angered the Lord .
7:2:013:0	They abandoned the Lord to serve Baal and the images of Ashtoreth .
7:2:014:0	This made the Lord burn with anger against Israel , so he handed them over to raiders who stole their possessions . He turned them over to their enemies all around , and they were no longer able to resist them .
7:2:007:1	The
7:2:008:1	Lord
7:2:009:1	Rescues His People
7:2:015:0	Every time Israel went out to battle , the Lord fought against them , causing them to be defeated , just as he had warned . And the people were in great distress .
7:2:016:0	Then the Lord raised up judges to rescue the Israelites from their attackers .
7:2:017:0	Yet Israel did not listen to the judges but prostituted themselves by worshiping other gods . How quickly they turned away from the path of their ancestors , who had walked in obedience to the Lord 's commands .
7:2:018:0	Whenever the Lord raised up a judge over Israel , he was with that judge and rescued the people from their enemies throughout the judge 's lifetime . For the Lord took pity on his people , who were burdened by oppression and suffering .
7:2:019:0	But when the judge died , the people returned to their corrupt ways , behaving worse than those who had lived before them . They went after other gods , serving and worshiping them . And they refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways .
7:2:020:0	So the Lord burned with anger against Israel . He said , “ Because these people have violated my covenant , which I made with their ancestors , and have ignored my commands ,
7:2:021:0	I will no longer drive out the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died .
7:2:022:0	I did this to test Israel—to see whether or not they would follow the ways of the Lord as their ancestors did . ”
7:2:023:0	That is why the Lord left those nations in place . He did not quickly drive them out or allow Joshua to conquer them all .
