7:17:001:1	Micah 's Idols
7:17:001:0	There was a man named Micah , who lived in the hill country of Ephraim .
7:17:002:0	One day he said to his mother , “ I heard you place a curse on the person who stole 1,100 pieces of silver from you . Well , I have the money . I was the one who took it. ” “ The Lord bless you for admitting it , ” his mother replied .
7:17:003:0	He returned the money to her , and she said , “ I now dedicate these silver coins to the Lord . In honor of my son , I will have an image carved and an idol cast . ”
7:17:004:0	So when he returned the money to his mother , she took 200 silver coins and gave them to a silversmith , who made them into an image and an idol . And these were placed in Micah 's house .
7:17:005:0	Micah set up a shrine for the idol , and he made a sacred ephod and some household idols . Then he installed one of his sons as his personal priest .
7:17:006:0	In those days Israel had no king ; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes .
7:17:007:0	One day a young Levite , who had been living in Bethlehem in Judah , arrived in that area .
7:17:008:0	He had left Bethlehem in search of another place to live , and as he traveled , he came to the hill country of Ephraim . He happened to stop at Micah 's house as he was traveling through .
7:17:009:0	“ Where are you from ? ” Micah asked him.He replied , “ I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , and I am looking for a place to live . ”
7:17:010:0	“ Stay here with me , ” Micah said , “ and you can be a father and priest to me . I will give you ten pieces of silver a year , plus a change of clothes and your food . ”
7:17:011:0	The Levite agreed to this , and the young man became like one of Micah 's sons .
7:17:012:0	So Micah installed the Levite as his personal priest , and he lived in Micah 's house .
7:17:013:0	“ I know the Lord will bless me now , ” Micah said , “ because I have a Levite serving as my priest . ”
