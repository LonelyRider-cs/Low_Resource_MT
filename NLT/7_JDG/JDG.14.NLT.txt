7:14:001:1	Samson 's Riddle
7:14:001:0	One day when Samson was in Timnah , one of the Philistine women caught his eye .
7:14:002:0	When he returned home , he told his father and mother , “ A young Philistine woman in Timnah caught my eye . I want to marry her . Get her for me . ”
7:14:003:0	His father and mother objected . “ Is n't there even one woman in our tribe or among all the Israelites you could marry ? ” they asked . “ Why must you go to the pagan Philistines to find a wife ? ” But Samson told his father , “ Get her for me ! She looks good to me . ”
7:14:004:0	His father and mother did n't realize the Lord was at work in this , creating an opportunity to work against the Philistines , who ruled over Israel at that time .
7:14:005:0	As Samson and his parents were going down to Timnah , a young lion suddenly attacked Samson near the vineyards of Timnah .
7:14:006:0	At that moment the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him , and he ripped the lion 's jaws apart with his bare hands . He did it as easily as if it were a young goat . But he did n't tell his father or mother about it .
7:14:007:0	When Samson arrived in Timnah , he talked with the woman and was very pleased with her .
7:14:008:0	Later , when he returned to Timnah for the wedding , he turned off the path to look at the carcass of the lion . And he found that a swarm of bees had made some honey in the carcass .
7:14:009:0	He scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate it along the way . He also gave some to his father and mother , and they ate it . But he did n't tell them he had taken the honey from the carcass of the lion .
7:14:010:0	As his father was making final arrangements for the marriage , Samson threw a party at Timnah , as was the custom for elite young men .
7:14:011:0	When the bride 's parents saw him , they selected thirty young men from the town to be his companions .
7:14:012:0	Samson said to them , “ Let me tell you a riddle . If you solve my riddle during these seven days of the celebration , I will give you thirty fine linen robes and thirty sets of festive clothing .
7:14:013:0	But if you ca n't solve it , then you must give me thirty fine linen robes and thirty sets of festive clothing. ” “ All right , ” they agreed , “ let 's hear your riddle . ”
7:14:014:0	So he said : “ Out of the one who eats came something to eat ; out of the strong came something sweet. ” Three days later they were still trying to figure it out .
7:14:015:0	On the fourth day they said to Samson 's wife , “ Entice your husband to explain the riddle for us , or we will burn down your father 's house with you in it . Did you invite us to this party just to make us poor ? ”
7:14:016:0	So Samson 's wife came to him in tears and said , “ You do n't love me ; you hate me ! You have given my people a riddle , but you have n't told me the answer. ” “ I have n't even given the answer to my father or mother , ” he replied . “ Why should I tell you ? ”
7:14:017:0	So she cried whenever she was with him and kept it up for the rest of the celebration . At last , on the seventh day he told her the answer because she was tormenting him with her nagging . Then she explained the riddle to the young men .
7:14:018:0	So before sunset of the seventh day , the men of the town came to Samson with their answer : “ What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? ” Samson replied , “ If you had n't plowed with my heifer , you would n't have solved my riddle ! ”
7:14:019:0	Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him . He went down to the town of Ashkelon , killed thirty men , took their belongings , and gave their clothing to the men who had solved his riddle . But Samson was furious about what had happened , and he went back home to live with his father and mother .
7:14:020:0	So his wife was given in marriage to the man who had been Samson 's best man at the wedding .
