7:20:001:1	Israel 's War with Benjamin
7:20:001:0	Then all the Israelites were united as one man , from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south , including those from across the Jordan in the land of Gilead . The entire community assembled in the presence of the Lord at Mizpah .
7:20:002:0	The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel—400,000 warriors armed with swords—took their positions in the assembly of the people of God .
7:20:003:0	( Word soon reached the land of Benjamin that the other tribes had gone up to Mizpah . ) The Israelites then asked how this terrible crime had happened .
7:20:004:0	The Levite , the husband of the woman who had been murdered , said , “ My concubine and I came to spend the night in Gibeah , a town that belongs to the people of Benjamin .
7:20:005:0	That night some of the leading citizens of Gibeah surrounded the house , planning to kill me , and they raped my concubine until she was dead .
7:20:006:0	So I cut her body into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the territory assigned to Israel , for these men have committed a terrible and shameful crime .
7:20:007:0	Now then , all of you—the entire community of Israel—must decide here and now what should be done about this ! ”
7:20:008:0	And all the people rose to their feet in unison and declared , “ None of us will return home ! No , not even one of us !
7:20:009:0	Instead , this is what we will do to Gibeah ; we will draw lots to decide who will attack it .
7:20:010:0	One-tenth of the men from each tribe will be chosen to supply the warriors with food , and the rest of us will take revenge on Gibeah of Benjamin for this shameful thing they have done in Israel . ”
7:20:011:0	So all the Israelites were completely united , and they gathered together to attack the town .
7:20:012:0	The Israelites sent messengers to the tribe of Benjamin , saying , “ What a terrible thing has been done among you !
7:20:013:0	Give up those evil men , those troublemakers from Gibeah , so we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil. ” But the people of Benjamin would not listen .
7:20:014:0	Instead , they came from their towns and gathered at Gibeah to fight the Israelites .
7:20:015:0	In all , 26,000 of their warriors armed with swords arrived in Gibeah to join the 700 elite troops who lived there .
7:20:016:0	Among Benjamin 's elite troops , 700 were left-handed , and each of them could sling a rock and hit a target within a hairsbreadth without missing .
7:20:017:0	Israel had 400,000 experienced soldiers armed with swords , not counting Benjamin 's warriors .
7:20:018:0	Before the battle the Israelites went to Bethel and asked God , “ Which tribe should go first to attack the people of Benjamin ? ” The Lord answered , “ Judah is to go first . ”
7:20:019:0	So the Israelites left early the next morning and camped near Gibeah .
7:20:020:0	Then they advanced toward Gibeah to attack the men of Benjamin .
7:20:021:0	But Benjamin 's warriors , who were defending the town , came out and killed 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day .
7:20:022:0	But the Israelites encouraged each other and took their positions again at the same place they had fought the previous day .
7:20:023:0	For they had gone up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the Lord until evening . They had asked the Lord , “ Should we fight against our relatives from Benjamin again ? ” And the Lord had said , “ Go out and fight against them . ”
7:20:024:0	So the next day they went out again to fight against the men of Benjamin ,
7:20:025:0	but the men of Benjamin killed another 18,000 Israelites , all of whom were experienced with the sword .
7:20:026:0	Then all the Israelites went up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the Lord and fasted until evening . They also brought burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord .
7:20:027:0	The Israelites went up seeking direction from the Lord . ( In those days the Ark of the Covenant of God was in Bethel ,
7:20:028:0	and Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron was the priest . ) The Israelites asked the Lord , “ Should we fight against our relatives from Benjamin again , or should we stop ? ” The Lord said , “ Go ! Tomorrow I will hand them over to you . ”
7:20:029:0	So the Israelites set an ambush all around Gibeah .
7:20:030:0	They went out on the third day and took their positions at the same place as before .
7:20:031:0	When the men of Benjamin came out to attack , they were drawn away from the town . And as they had done before , they began to kill the Israelites . About thirty Israelites died in the open fields and along the roads , one leading to Bethel and the other leading back to Gibeah .
7:20:032:0	Then the warriors of Benjamin shouted , “ We 're defeating them as we did before ! ” But the Israelites had planned in advance to run away so that the men of Benjamin would chase them along the roads and be drawn away from the town .
7:20:033:0	When the main group of Israelite warriors reached Baal-tamar , they turned and took up their positions . Meanwhile , the Israelites hiding in ambush to the west of Gibeah jumped up to fight .
7:20:034:0	There were 10,000 elite Israelite troops who advanced against Gibeah . The fighting was so heavy that Benjamin did n't realize the impending disaster .
7:20:035:0	So the Lord helped Israel defeat Benjamin , and that day the Israelites killed 25,100 of Benjamin 's warriors , all of whom were experienced swordsmen .
7:20:036:0	Then the men of Benjamin saw that they were beaten.The Israelites had retreated from Benjamin 's warriors in order to give those hiding in ambush more room to maneuver against Gibeah .
7:20:037:0	Then those who were hiding rushed in from all sides and killed everyone in the town .
7:20:038:0	They had arranged to send up a large cloud of smoke from the town as a signal .
7:20:039:0	When the Israelites saw the smoke , they turned and attacked Benjamin 's warriors.By that time Benjamin 's warriors had killed about thirty Israelites , and they shouted , “ We 're defeating them as we did in the first battle ! ”
7:20:040:0	But when the warriors of Benjamin looked behind them and saw the smoke rising into the sky from every part of the town ,
7:20:041:0	the men of Israel turned and attacked . At this point the men of Benjamin became terrified , because they realized disaster was close at hand .
7:20:042:0	So they turned around and fled before the Israelites toward the wilderness . But they could n't escape the battle , and the people who came out of the nearby towns were also killed .
7:20:043:0	The Israelites surrounded the men of Benjamin and chased them relentlessly , finally overtaking them east of Gibeah .
7:20:044:0	That day 18,000 of Benjamin 's strongest warriors died in battle .
7:20:045:0	The survivors fled into the wilderness toward the rock of Rimmon , but Israel killed 5,000 of them along the road . They continued the chase until they had killed another 2,000 near Gidom .
7:20:046:0	So that day the tribe of Benjamin lost 25,000 strong warriors armed with swords ,
7:20:047:0	leaving only 600 men who escaped to the rock of Rimmon , where they lived for four months .
7:20:048:0	And the Israelites returned and slaughtered every living thing in all the towns—the people , the livestock , and everything they found . They also burned down all the towns they came to .
