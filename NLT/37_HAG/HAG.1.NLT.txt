37:1:001:1	A Call to Rebuild the Temple
37:1:001:0	On August 29 of the second year of King Darius 's reign , the Lord gave a message through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Jeshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest .
37:1:002:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : The people are saying , ‘ The time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord . ' ”
37:1:003:0	Then the Lord sent this message through the prophet Haggai :
37:1:004:0	“ Why are you living in luxurious houses while my house lies in ruins ?
37:1:005:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Look at what 's happening to you !
37:1:006:0	You have planted much but harvest little . You eat but are not satisfied . You drink but are still thirsty . You put on clothes but can not keep warm . Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes !
37:1:007:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Look at what 's happening to you !
37:1:008:0	Now go up into the hills , bring down timber , and rebuild my house . Then I will take pleasure in it and be honored , says the Lord .
37:1:009:0	You hoped for rich harvests , but they were poor . And when you brought your harvest home , I blew it away . Why ? Because my house lies in ruins , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , while all of you are busy building your own fine houses .
37:1:010:0	It 's because of you that the heavens withhold the dew and the earth produces no crops .
37:1:002:1	Obedience to God 's Call
37:1:011:0	I have called for a drought on your fields and hills—a drought to wither the grain and grapes and olive trees and all your other crops , a drought to starve you and your livestock and to ruin everything you have worked so hard to get . ”
37:1:012:0	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and the whole remnant of God 's people began to obey the message from the Lord their God . When they heard the words of the prophet Haggai , whom the Lord their God had sent , the people feared the Lord .
37:1:013:0	Then Haggai , the Lord 's messenger , gave the people this message from the Lord : “ I am with you , says the Lord ! ”
37:1:014:0	So the Lord sparked the enthusiasm of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and the enthusiasm of Jeshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and the enthusiasm of the whole remnant of God 's people . They began to work on the house of their God , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies ,
37:1:015:0	on September 21 of the second year of King Darius 's reign .
