37:2:001:1	The New Temple 's Diminished Splendor
37:2:001:0	Then on October 17 of that same year , the Lord sent another message through the prophet Haggai .
37:2:002:0	“ Say this to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Jeshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of God 's people there in the land :
37:2:003:0	‘ Does anyone remember this house—this Temple—in its former splendor ? How , in comparison , does it look to you now ? It must seem like nothing at all !
37:2:004:0	But now the Lord says : Be strong , Zerubbabel . Be strong , Jeshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest . Be strong , all you people still left in the land . And now get to work , for I am with you , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
37:2:005:0	My Spirit remains among you , just as I promised when you came out of Egypt . So do not be afraid . '
37:2:006:0	“ For this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : In just a little while I will again shake the heavens and the earth , the oceans and the dry land .
37:2:007:0	I will shake all the nations , and the treasures of all the nations will be brought to this Temple . I will fill this place with glory , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
37:2:008:0	The silver is mine , and the gold is mine , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
37:2:002:1	Blessings Promised for Obedience
37:2:009:0	The future glory of this Temple will be greater than its past glory , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . And in this place I will bring peace . I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken ! ”
37:2:010:0	On December 18 of the second year of King Darius 's reign , the Lord sent this message to the prophet Haggai :
37:2:011:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says . Ask the priests this question about the law :
37:2:012:0	‘ If one of you is carrying some meat from a holy sacrifice in his robes and his robe happens to brush against some bread or stew , wine or olive oil , or any other kind of food , will it also become holy ? ' ” The priests replied , “ No . ”
37:2:013:0	Then Haggai asked , “ If someone becomes ceremonially unclean by touching a dead person and then touches any of these foods , will the food be defiled ? ” And the priests answered , “ Yes . ”
37:2:014:0	Then Haggai responded , “ That is how it is with this people and this nation , says the Lord . Everything they do and everything they offer is defiled by their sin .
37:2:015:0	Look at what was happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of the Lord 's Temple .
37:2:016:0	When you hoped for a twenty-bushel crop , you harvested only ten . When you expected to draw fifty gallons from the winepress , you found only twenty .
37:2:017:0	I sent blight and mildew and hail to destroy everything you worked so hard to produce . Even so , you refused to return to me , says the Lord .
37:2:018:0	“ Think about this eighteenth day of December , the day when the foundation of the Lord 's Temple was laid . Think carefully .
37:2:003:1	Promises for Zerubbabel
37:2:019:0	I am giving you a promise now while the seed is still in the barn . You have not yet harvested your grain , and your grapevines , fig trees , pomegranates , and olive trees have not yet produced their crops . But from this day onward I will bless you . ”
37:2:020:0	On that same day , December 18 , the Lord sent this second message to Haggai :
37:2:021:0	“ Tell Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah , that I am about to shake the heavens and the earth .
37:2:022:0	I will overthrow royal thrones and destroy the power of foreign kingdoms . I will overturn their chariots and riders . The horses will fall , and their riders will kill each other .
37:2:023:0	“ But when this happens , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , I will honor you , Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , my servant . I will make you like a signet ring on my finger , says the Lord , for I have chosen you . I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken ! ”
