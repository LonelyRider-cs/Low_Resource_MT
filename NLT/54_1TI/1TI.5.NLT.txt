54:5:001:1	Advice about Widows , Elders , and Slaves
54:5:001:0	Never speak harshly to an older man , but appeal to him respectfully as you would to your own father . Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers .
54:5:002:0	Treat older women as you would your mother , and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters .
54:5:003:0	Take care of any widow who has no one else to care for her .
54:5:004:0	But if she has children or grandchildren , their first responsibility is to show godliness at home and repay their parents by taking care of them . This is something that pleases God .
54:5:005:0	Now a true widow , a woman who is truly alone in this world , has placed her hope in God . She prays night and day , asking God for his help .
54:5:006:0	But the widow who lives only for pleasure is spiritually dead even while she lives .
54:5:007:0	Give these instructions to the church so that no one will be open to criticism .
54:5:008:0	But those who wo n't care for their relatives , especially those in their own household , have denied the true faith . Such people are worse than unbelievers .
54:5:009:0	A widow who is put on the list for support must be a woman who is at least sixty years old and was faithful to her husband .
54:5:010:0	She must be well respected by everyone because of the good she has done . Has she brought up her children well ? Has she been kind to strangers and served other believers humbly ? Has she helped those who are in trouble ? Has she always been ready to do good ?
54:5:011:0	The younger widows should not be on the list , because their physical desires will overpower their devotion to Christ and they will want to remarry .
54:5:012:0	Then they would be guilty of breaking their previous pledge .
54:5:013:0	And if they are on the list , they will learn to be lazy and will spend their time gossiping from house to house , meddling in other people 's business and talking about things they should n't .
54:5:014:0	So I advise these younger widows to marry again , have children , and take care of their own homes . Then the enemy will not be able to say anything against them .
54:5:015:0	For I am afraid that some of them have already gone astray and now follow Satan .
54:5:016:0	If a woman who is a believer has relatives who are widows , she must take care of them and not put the responsibility on the church . Then the church can care for the widows who are truly alone .
54:5:017:0	Elders who do their work well should be respected and paid well , especially those who work hard at both preaching and teaching .
54:5:018:0	For the Scripture says , “ You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain. ” And in another place , “ Those who work deserve their pay ! ”
54:5:019:0	Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses .
54:5:020:0	Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church ; this will serve as a strong warning to others .
54:5:021:0	I solemnly command you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus and the highest angels to obey these instructions without taking sides or showing favoritism to anyone .
54:5:022:0	Never be in a hurry about appointing a church leader . Do not share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
54:5:023:0	Do n't drink only water . You ought to drink a little wine for the sake of your stomach because you are sick so often .
54:5:024:0	Remember , the sins of some people are obvious , leading them to certain judgment . But there are others whose sins will not be revealed until later .
54:5:025:0	In the same way , the good deeds of some people are obvious . And the good deeds done in secret will someday come to light .
