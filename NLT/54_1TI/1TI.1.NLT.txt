54:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
54:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus , appointed by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus , who gives us hope .
54:1:002:1	Warnings against False Teachings
54:1:002:0	I am writing to Timothy , my true son in the faith.May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy , and peace .
54:1:003:0	When I left for Macedonia , I urged you to stay there in Ephesus and stop those whose teaching is contrary to the truth .
54:1:004:0	Do n't let them waste their time in endless discussion of myths and spiritual pedigrees . These things only lead to meaningless speculations , which do n't help people live a life of faith in God .
54:1:005:0	The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart , a clear conscience , and genuine faith .
54:1:006:0	But some people have missed this whole point . They have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions .
54:1:007:0	They want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses , but they do n't know what they are talking about , even though they speak so confidently .
54:1:008:0	We know that the law is good when used correctly .
54:1:009:0	For the law was not intended for people who do what is right . It is for people who are lawless and rebellious , who are ungodly and sinful , who consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy , who kill their father or mother or commit other murders .
54:1:010:0	The law is for people who are sexually immoral , or who practice homosexuality , or are slave traders , liars , promise breakers , or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome teaching
54:1:003:1	Paul 's Gratitude for God 's Mercy
54:1:011:0	that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God .
54:1:012:0	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength to do his work . He considered me trustworthy and appointed me to serve him ,
54:1:013:0	even though I used to blaspheme the name of Christ . In my insolence , I persecuted his people . But God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance and unbelief .
54:1:014:0	Oh , how generous and gracious our Lord was ! He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus .
54:1:015:0	This is a trustworthy saying , and everyone should accept it : “ Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ” — and I am the worst of them all .
54:1:016:0	But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners . Then others will realize that they , too , can believe in him and receive eternal life .
54:1:004:1	Timothy 's Responsibility
54:1:017:0	All honor and glory to God forever and ever ! He is the eternal King , the unseen one who never dies ; he alone is God . Amen .
54:1:018:0	Timothy , my son , here are my instructions for you , based on the prophetic words spoken about you earlier . May they help you fight well in the Lord 's battles .
54:1:019:0	Cling to your faith in Christ , and keep your conscience clear . For some people have deliberately violated their consciences ; as a result , their faith has been shipwrecked .
54:1:020:0	Hymenaeus and Alexander are two examples . I threw them out and handed them over to Satan so they might learn not to blaspheme God .
