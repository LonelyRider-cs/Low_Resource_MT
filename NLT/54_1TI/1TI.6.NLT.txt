54:6:001:0	All slaves should show full respect for their masters so they will not bring shame on the name of God and his teaching .
54:6:001:1	False Teaching and True Riches
54:6:002:0	If the masters are believers , that is no excuse for being disrespectful . Those slaves should work all the harder because their efforts are helping other believers who are well loved.Teach these things , Timothy , and encourage everyone to obey them .
54:6:003:0	Some people may contradict our teaching , but these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ . These teachings promote a godly life .
54:6:004:0	Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding . Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words . This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy , division , slander , and evil suspicions .
54:6:005:0	These people always cause trouble . Their minds are corrupt , and they have turned their backs on the truth . To them , a show of godliness is just a way to become wealthy .
54:6:006:0	Yet true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth .
54:6:007:0	After all , we brought nothing with us when we came into the world , and we ca n't take anything with us when we leave it .
54:6:008:0	So if we have enough food and clothing , let us be content .
54:6:009:0	But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction .
54:6:002:1	Paul 's Final Instructions
54:6:010:0	For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil . And some people , craving money , have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows .
54:6:011:0	But you , Timothy , are a man of God ; so run from all these evil things . Pursue righteousness and a godly life , along with faith , love , perseverance , and gentleness .
54:6:012:0	Fight the good fight for the true faith . Hold tightly to the eternal life to which God has called you , which you have declared so well before many witnesses .
54:6:013:0	And I charge you before God , who gives life to all , and before Christ Jesus , who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate ,
54:6:014:0	that you obey this command without wavering . Then no one can find fault with you from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
54:6:015:0	For , At just the right time Christ will be revealed from heaven by the blessed and only almighty God , the King of all kings and Lord of all lords .
54:6:016:0	He alone can never die , and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him . No human eye has ever seen him , nor ever will . All honor and power to him forever ! Amen .
54:6:017:0	Teach those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money , which is so unreliable . Their trust should be in God , who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment .
54:6:018:0	Tell them to use their money to do good . They should be rich in good works and generous to those in need , always being ready to share with others .
54:6:019:0	By doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may experience true life .
54:6:020:0	Timothy , guard what God has entrusted to you . Avoid godless , foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge .
54:6:021:0	Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness.May God 's grace be with you all .
