55:2:001:1	A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus
55:2:001:0	Timothy , my dear son , be strong through the grace that God gives you in Christ Jesus .
55:2:002:0	You have heard me teach things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses . Now teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others .
55:2:003:0	Endure suffering along with me , as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55:2:004:0	Soldiers do n't get tied up in the affairs of civilian life , for then they can not please the officer who enlisted them .
55:2:005:0	And athletes can not win the prize unless they follow the rules .
55:2:006:0	And hardworking farmers should be the first to enjoy the fruit of their labor .
55:2:007:0	Think about what I am saying . The Lord will help you understand all these things .
55:2:008:0	Always remember that Jesus Christ , a descendant of King David , was raised from the dead . This is the Good News I preach .
55:2:009:0	And because I preach this Good News , I am suffering and have been chained like a criminal . But the word of God can not be chained .
55:2:010:0	So I am willing to endure anything if it will bring salvation and eternal glory in Christ Jesus to those God has chosen .
55:2:011:0	This is a trustworthy saying : If we die with him , we will also live with him .
55:2:012:0	If we endure hardship , we will reign with him.If we deny him , he will deny us .
55:2:013:0	If we are unfaithful , he remains faithful , for he can not deny who he is .
55:2:002:1	An Approved Worker
55:2:014:0	Remind everyone about these things , and command them in God 's presence to stop fighting over words . Such arguments are useless , and they can ruin those who hear them .
55:2:015:0	Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his approval . Be a good worker , one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth .
55:2:016:0	Avoid worthless , foolish talk that only leads to more godless behavior .
55:2:017:0	This kind of talk spreads like cancer , as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus .
55:2:018:0	They have left the path of truth , claiming that the resurrection of the dead has already occurred ; in this way , they have turned some people away from the faith .
55:2:019:0	But God 's truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription : “ The Lord knows those who are his , ” and “ All who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil . ”
55:2:020:0	In a wealthy home some utensils are made of gold and silver , and some are made of wood and clay . The expensive utensils are used for special occasions , and the cheap ones are for everyday use .
55:2:021:0	If you keep yourself pure , you will be a special utensil for honorable use . Your life will be clean , and you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work .
55:2:022:0	Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts . Instead , pursue righteous living , faithfulness , love , and peace . Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts .
55:2:023:0	Again I say , do n't get involved in foolish , ignorant arguments that only start fights .
55:2:024:0	A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone , be able to teach , and be patient with difficult people .
55:2:025:0	Gently instruct those who oppose the truth . Perhaps God will change those people 's hearts , and they will learn the truth .
55:2:026:0	Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil 's trap . For they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants .
