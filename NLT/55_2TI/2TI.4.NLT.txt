55:4:001:0	I solemnly urge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus , who will someday judge the living and the dead when he comes to set up his Kingdom :
55:4:002:0	Preach the word of God . Be prepared , whether the time is favorable or not . Patiently correct , rebuke , and encourage your people with good teaching .
55:4:003:0	For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching . They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear .
55:4:004:0	They will reject the truth and chase after myths .
55:4:005:0	But you should keep a clear mind in every situation . Do n't be afraid of suffering for the Lord . Work at telling others the Good News , and fully carry out the ministry God has given you .
55:4:006:0	As for me , my life has already been poured out as an offering to God . The time of my death is near .
55:4:007:0	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , and I have remained faithful .
55:4:001:1	Paul 's Final Words
55:4:008:0	And now the prize awaits me â€” the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will give me on the day of his return . And the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his appearing .
55:4:009:0	Timothy , please come as soon as you can .
55:4:010:0	Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus has gone to Dalmatia .
55:4:011:0	Only Luke is with me . Bring Mark with you when you come , for he will be helpful to me in my ministry .
55:4:012:0	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55:4:013:0	When you come , be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas . Also bring my books , and especially my papers .
55:4:014:0	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm , but the Lord will judge him for what he has done .
55:4:015:0	Be careful of him , for he fought against everything we said .
55:4:016:0	The first time I was brought before the judge , no one came with me . Everyone abandoned me . May it not be counted against them .
55:4:017:0	But the Lord stood with me and gave me strength so that I might preach the Good News in its entirety for all the Gentiles to hear . And he rescued me from certain death .
55:4:002:1	Paul 's Final Greetings
55:4:018:0	Yes , and the Lord will deliver me from every evil attack and will bring me safely into his heavenly Kingdom . All glory to God forever and ever ! Amen .
55:4:019:0	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and those living in the household of Onesiphorus .
55:4:020:0	Erastus stayed at Corinth , and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus .
55:4:021:0	Do your best to get here before winter . Eubulus sends you greetings , and so do Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers and sisters .
55:4:022:0	May the Lord be with your spirit . And may his grace be with all of you .
