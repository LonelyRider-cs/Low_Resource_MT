46:9:001:1	Paul Gives Up His Rights
46:9:001:0	Am I not as free as anyone else ? Am I not an apostle ? Have n't I seen Jesus our Lord with my own eyes ? Is n't it because of my work that you belong to the Lord ?
46:9:002:0	Even if others think I am not an apostle , I certainly am to you . You yourselves are proof that I am the Lord 's apostle .
46:9:003:0	This is my answer to those who question my authority .
46:9:004:0	Do n't we have the right to live in your homes and share your meals ?
46:9:005:0	Do n't we have the right to bring a believing wife with us as the other apostles and the Lord 's brothers do , and as Peter does ?
46:9:006:0	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have to work to support ourselves ?
46:9:007:0	What soldier has to pay his own expenses ? What farmer plants a vineyard and does n't have the right to eat some of its fruit ? What shepherd cares for a flock of sheep and is n't allowed to drink some of the milk ?
46:9:008:0	Am I expressing merely a human opinion , or does the law say the same thing ?
46:9:009:0	For the law of Moses says , “ You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain. ” Was God thinking only about oxen when he said this ?
46:9:010:0	Was n't he actually speaking to us ? Yes , it was written for us , so that the one who plows and the one who threshes the grain might both expect a share of the harvest .
46:9:011:0	Since we have planted spiritual seed among you , are n't we entitled to a harvest of physical food and drink ?
46:9:012:0	If you support others who preach to you , should n't we have an even greater right to be supported ? But we have never used this right . We would rather put up with anything than be an obstacle to the Good News about Christ .
46:9:013:0	Do n't you realize that those who work in the temple get their meals from the offerings brought to the temple ? And those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings .
46:9:014:0	In the same way , the Lord ordered that those who preach the Good News should be supported by those who benefit from it .
46:9:015:0	Yet I have never used any of these rights . And I am not writing this to suggest that I want to start now . In fact , I would rather die than lose my right to boast about preaching without charge .
46:9:016:0	Yet preaching the Good News is not something I can boast about . I am compelled by God to do it . How terrible for me if I did n't preach the Good News !
46:9:017:0	If I were doing this on my own initiative , I would deserve payment . But I have no choice , for God has given me this sacred trust .
46:9:018:0	What then is my pay ? It is the opportunity to preach the Good News without charging anyone . That 's why I never demand my rights when I preach the Good News .
46:9:019:0	Even though I am a free man with no master , I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ .
46:9:020:0	When I was with the Jews , I lived like a Jew to bring the Jews to Christ . When I was with those who follow the Jewish law , I too lived under that law . Even though I am not subject to the law , I did this so I could bring to Christ those who are under the law .
46:9:021:0	When I am with the Gentiles who do not follow the Jewish law , I too live apart from that law so I can bring them to Christ . But I do not ignore the law of God ; I obey the law of Christ .
46:9:022:0	When I am with those who are weak , I share their weakness , for I want to bring the weak to Christ . Yes , I try to find common ground with everyone , doing everything I can to save some .
46:9:023:0	I do everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings .
46:9:024:0	Do n't you realize that in a race everyone runs , but only one person gets the prize ? So run to win !
46:9:025:0	All athletes are disciplined in their training . They do it to win a prize that will fade away , but we do it for an eternal prize .
46:9:026:0	So I run with purpose in every step . I am not just shadowboxing .
46:9:027:0	I discipline my body like an athlete , training it to do what it should . Otherwise , I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified .
