46:3:001:1	Paul and Apollos , Servants of Christ
46:3:001:0	Dear brothers and sisters , when I was with you I could n't talk to you as I would to spiritual people . I had to talk as though you belonged to this world or as though you were infants in Christ .
46:3:002:0	I had to feed you with milk , not with solid food , because you were n't ready for anything stronger . And you still are n't ready ,
46:3:003:0	for you are still controlled by your sinful nature . You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other . Does n't that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature ? Are n't you living like people of the world ?
46:3:004:0	When one of you says , “ I am a follower of Paul , ” and another says , “ I follow Apollos , ” are n't you acting just like people of the world ?
46:3:005:0	After all , who is Apollos ? Who is Paul ? We are only God 's servants through whom you believed the Good News . Each of us did the work the Lord gave us .
46:3:006:0	I planted the seed in your hearts , and Apollos watered it , but it was God who made it grow .
46:3:007:0	It 's not important who does the planting , or who does the watering . What 's important is that God makes the seed grow .
46:3:008:0	The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose . And both will be rewarded for their own hard work .
46:3:009:0	For we are both God 's workers . And you are God 's field . You are God 's building .
46:3:010:0	Because of God 's grace to me , I have laid the foundation like an expert builder . Now others are building on it . But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful .
46:3:011:0	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have — Jesus Christ .
46:3:012:0	Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials — gold , silver , jewels , wood , hay , or straw .
46:3:013:0	But on the judgment day , fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done . The fire will show if a person 's work has any value .
46:3:014:0	If the work survives , that builder will receive a reward .
46:3:015:0	But if the work is burned up , the builder will suffer great loss . The builder will be saved , but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames .
46:3:016:0	Do n't you realize that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you ?
46:3:017:0	God will destroy anyone who destroys this temple . For God 's temple is holy , and you are that temple .
46:3:018:0	Stop deceiving yourselves . If you think you are wise by this world 's standards , you need to become a fool to be truly wise .
46:3:019:0	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God . As the Scriptures say , “ He traps the wisein the snare of their own cleverness . ”
46:3:020:0	And again , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise ; he knows they are worthless . ”
46:3:021:0	So do n't boast about following a particular human leader . For everything belongs to you —
46:3:022:0	whether Paul or Apollos or Peter , or the world , or life and death , or the present and the future . Everything belongs to you ,
46:3:023:0	and you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
