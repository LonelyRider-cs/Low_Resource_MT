46:6:001:1	Avoiding Lawsuits with Christians
46:6:001:0	When one of you has a dispute with another believer , how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers !
46:6:002:0	Do n't you realize that someday we believers will judge the world ? And since you are going to judge the world , ca n't you decide even these little things among yourselves ?
46:6:003:0	Do n't you realize that we will judge angels ? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life .
46:6:004:0	If you have legal disputes about such matters , why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church ?
46:6:005:0	I am saying this to shame you . Is n't there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues ?
46:6:006:0	But instead , one believer sues another—right in front of unbelievers !
46:6:007:0	Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you . Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that ? Why not let yourselves be cheated ?
46:6:008:0	Instead , you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers .
46:6:009:0	Do n't you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Do n't fool yourselves . Those who indulge in sexual sin , or who worship idols , or commit adultery , or are male prostitutes , or practice homosexuality ,
46:6:010:0	or are thieves , or greedy people , or drunkards , or are abusive , or cheat people—none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God .
46:6:002:1	Avoiding Sexual Sin
46:6:011:0	Some of you were once like that . But you were cleansed ; you were made holy ; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
46:6:012:0	You say , “ I am allowed to do anything ” —but not everything is good for you . And even though “ I am allowed to do anything , ” I must not become a slave to anything .
46:6:013:0	You say , “ Food was made for the stomach , and the stomach for food. ” ( This is true , though someday God will do away with both of them . ) But you ca n't say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality . They were made for the Lord , and the Lord cares about our bodies .
46:6:014:0	And God will raise us from the dead by his power , just as he raised our Lord from the dead .
46:6:015:0	Do n't you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ ? Should a man take his body , which is part of Christ , and join it to a prostitute ? Never !
46:6:016:0	And do n't you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute , he becomes one body with her ? For the Scriptures say , “ The two are united into one . ”
46:6:017:0	But the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him .
46:6:018:0	Run from sexual sin ! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does . For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body .
46:6:019:0	Do n't you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit , who lives in you and was given to you by God ? You do not belong to yourself ,
46:6:020:0	for God bought you with a high price . So you must honor God with your body .
