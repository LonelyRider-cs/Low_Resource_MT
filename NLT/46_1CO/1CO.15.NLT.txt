46:15:001:1	The Resurrection of Christ
46:15:001:0	Let me now remind you , dear brothers and sisters , of the Good News I preached to you before . You welcomed it then , and you still stand firm in it .
46:15:002:0	It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you — unless , of course , you believed something that was never true in the first place .
46:15:003:0	I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me . Christ died for our sins , just as the Scriptures said .
46:15:004:0	He was buried , and he was raised from the dead on the third day , just as the Scriptures said .
46:15:005:0	He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve .
46:15:006:0	After that , he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time , most of whom are still alive , though some have died .
46:15:007:0	Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles .
46:15:008:0	Last of all , as though I had been born at the wrong time , I also saw him .
46:15:009:0	For I am the least of all the apostles . In fact , I 'm not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God 's church .
46:15:010:0	But whatever I am now , it is all because God poured out his special favor on me — and not without results . For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles ; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace .
46:15:002:1	The Resurrection of the Dead
46:15:011:0	So it makes no difference whether I preach or they preach , for we all preach the same message you have already believed .
46:15:012:0	But tell me this — since we preach that Christ rose from the dead , why are some of you saying there will be no resurrection of the dead ?
46:15:013:0	For if there is no resurrection of the dead , then Christ has not been raised either .
46:15:014:0	And if Christ has not been raised , then all our preaching is useless , and your faith is useless .
46:15:015:0	And we apostles would all be lying about God — for we have said that God raised Christ from the grave . But that ca n't be true if there is no resurrection of the dead .
46:15:016:0	And if there is no resurrection of the dead , then Christ has not been raised .
46:15:017:0	And if Christ has not been raised , then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins .
46:15:018:0	In that case , all who have died believing in Christ are lost !
46:15:019:0	And if our hope in Christ is only for this life , we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world .
46:15:020:0	But in fact , Christ has been raised from the dead . He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died .
46:15:021:0	So you see , just as death came into the world through a man , now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man .
46:15:022:0	Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam , everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life .
46:15:023:0	But there is an order to this resurrection : Christ was raised as the first of the harvest ; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back .
46:15:024:0	After that the end will come , when he will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father , having destroyed every ruler and authority and power .
46:15:025:0	For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet .
46:15:026:0	And the last enemy to be destroyed is death .
46:15:027:0	For the Scriptures say , “ God has put all things under his authority. ” ( Of course , when it says “ all things are under his authority , ” that does not include God himself , who gave Christ his authority . )
46:15:028:0	Then , when all things are under his authority , the Son will put himself under God 's authority , so that God , who gave his Son authority over all things , will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere .
46:15:029:0	If the dead will not be raised , what point is there in people being baptized for those who are dead ? Why do it unless the dead will someday rise again ?
46:15:030:0	And why should we ourselves risk our lives hour by hour ?
46:15:031:0	For I swear , dear brothers and sisters , that I face death daily . This is as certain as my pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done in you .
46:15:032:0	And what value was there in fighting wild beasts — those people of Ephesus — if there will be no resurrection from the dead ? And if there is no resurrection , “ Let 's feast and drink , for tomorrow we die ! ”
46:15:033:0	Do n't be fooled by those who say such things , for “ bad company corrupts good character . ”
46:15:003:1	The Resurrection Body
46:15:034:0	Think carefully about what is right , and stop sinning . For to your shame I say that some of you do n't know God at all .
46:15:035:0	But someone may ask , “ How will the dead be raised ? What kind of bodies will they have ? ”
46:15:036:0	What a foolish question ! When you put a seed into the ground , it does n't grow into a plant unless it dies first .
46:15:037:0	And what you put in the ground is not the plant that will grow , but only a bare seed of wheat or whatever you are planting .
46:15:038:0	Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have . A different plant grows from each kind of seed .
46:15:039:0	Similarly there are different kinds of flesh — one kind for humans , another for animals , another for birds , and another for fish .
46:15:040:0	There are also bodies in the heavens and bodies on the earth . The glory of the heavenly bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies .
46:15:041:0	The sun has one kind of glory , while the moon and stars each have another kind . And even the stars differ from each other in their glory .
46:15:042:0	It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead . Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die , but they will be raised to live forever .
46:15:043:0	Our bodies are buried in brokenness , but they will be raised in glory . They are buried in weakness , but they will be raised in strength .
46:15:044:0	They are buried as natural human bodies , but they will be raised as spiritual bodies . For just as there are natural bodies , there are also spiritual bodies .
46:15:045:0	The Scriptures tell us , “ The first man , Adam , became a living person. ” But the last Adam — that is , Christ — is a life-giving Spirit .
46:15:046:0	What comes first is the natural body , then the spiritual body comes later .
46:15:047:0	Adam , the first man , was made from the dust of the earth , while Christ , the second man , came from heaven .
46:15:048:0	Earthly people are like the earthly man , and heavenly people are like the heavenly man .
46:15:049:0	Just as we are now like the earthly man , we will someday be like the heavenly man .
46:15:050:0	What I am saying , dear brothers and sisters , is that our physical bodies can not inherit the Kingdom of God . These dying bodies can not inherit what will last forever .
46:15:051:0	But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret . We will not all die , but we will all be transformed !
46:15:052:0	It will happen in a moment , in the blink of an eye , when the last trumpet is blown . For when the trumpet sounds , those who have died will be raised to live forever . And we who are living will also be transformed .
46:15:053:0	For our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die ; our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies .
46:15:054:0	Then , when our dying bodies have been transformed into bodies that will never die , this Scripture will be fulfilled : “ Death is swallowed up in victory .
46:15:055:0	O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ”
46:15:056:0	For sin is the sting that results in death , and the law gives sin its power .
46:15:057:0	But thank God ! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46:15:058:0	So , my dear brothers and sisters , be strong and immovable . Always work enthusiastically for the Lord , for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless .
