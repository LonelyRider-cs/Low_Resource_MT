46:10:001:1	Lessons from Israel 's Idolatry
46:10:001:0	I do n't want you to forget , dear brothers and sisters , about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago . All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them , and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground .
46:10:002:0	In the cloud and in the sea , all of them were baptized as followers of Moses .
46:10:003:0	All of them ate the same spiritual food ,
46:10:004:0	and all of them drank the same spiritual water . For they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them , and that rock was Christ .
46:10:005:0	Yet God was not pleased with most of them , and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness .
46:10:006:0	These things happened as a warning to us , so that we would not crave evil things as they did ,
46:10:007:0	or worship idols as some of them did . As the Scriptures say , “ The people celebrated with feasting and drinking , and they indulged in pagan revelry . ”
46:10:008:0	And we must not engage in sexual immorality as some of them did , causing 23,000 of them to die in one day .
46:10:009:0	Nor should we put Christ to the test , as some of them did and then died from snakebites .
46:10:010:0	And do n't grumble as some of them did , and then were destroyed by the angel of death .
46:10:011:0	These things happened to them as examples for us . They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age .
46:10:012:0	If you think you are standing strong , be careful not to fall .
46:10:013:0	The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience . And God is faithful . He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand . When you are tempted , he will show you a way out so that you can endure .
46:10:014:0	So , my dear friends , flee from the worship of idols .
46:10:015:0	You are reasonable people . Decide for yourselves if what I am saying is true .
46:10:016:0	When we bless the cup at the Lord 's Table , are n't we sharing in the blood of Christ ? And when we break the bread , are n't we sharing in the body of Christ ?
46:10:017:0	And though we are many , we all eat from one loaf of bread , showing that we are one body .
46:10:018:0	Think about the people of Israel . Were n't they united by eating the sacrifices at the altar ?
46:10:019:0	What am I trying to say ? Am I saying that food offered to idols has some significance , or that idols are real gods ?
46:10:020:0	No , not at all . I am saying that these sacrifices are offered to demons , not to God . And I do n't want you to participate with demons .
46:10:021:0	You can not drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of demons , too . You can not eat at the Lord 's Table and at the table of demons , too .
46:10:022:0	What ? Do we dare to rouse the Lord 's jealousy ? Do you think we are stronger than he is ?
46:10:023:0	You say , “ I am allowed to do anything ” —but not everything is good for you . You say , “ I am allowed to do anything ” —but not everything is beneficial .
46:10:024:0	Do n't be concerned for your own good but for the good of others .
46:10:025:0	So you may eat any meat that is sold in the marketplace without raising questions of conscience .
46:10:026:0	For “ the earth is the Lord 's , and everything in it . ”
46:10:027:0	If someone who is n't a believer asks you home for dinner , accept the invitation if you want to . Eat whatever is offered to you without raising questions of conscience .
46:10:028:0	( But suppose someone tells you , “ This meat was offered to an idol. ” Do n't eat it , out of consideration for the conscience of the one who told you .
46:10:029:0	It might not be a matter of conscience for you , but it is for the other person . ) For why should my freedom be limited by what someone else thinks ?
46:10:030:0	If I can thank God for the food and enjoy it , why should I be condemned for eating it ?
46:10:031:0	So whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do it all for the glory of God .
46:10:032:0	Do n't give offense to Jews or Gentiles or the church of God .
46:10:033:0	I , too , try to please everyone in everything I do . I do n't just do what is best for me ; I do what is best for others so that many may be saved .
46:10:034:0	And you should imitate me , just as I imitate Christ .
