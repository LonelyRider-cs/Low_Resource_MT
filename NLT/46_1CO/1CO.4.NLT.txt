46:4:001:1	Paul 's Relationship with the Corinthians
46:4:001:0	So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God 's mysteries .
46:4:002:0	Now , a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful .
46:4:003:0	As for me , it matters very little how I might be evaluated by you or by any human authority . I do n't even trust my own judgment on this point .
46:4:004:0	My conscience is clear , but that does n't prove I 'm right . It is the Lord himself who will examine me and decide .
46:4:005:0	So do n't make judgments about anyone ahead of time—before the Lord returns . For he will bring our darkest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives . Then God will give to each one whatever praise is due .
46:4:006:0	Dear brothers and sisters , I have used Apollos and myself to illustrate what I 've been saying . If you pay attention to what I have quoted from the Scriptures , you wo n't be proud of one of your leaders at the expense of another .
46:4:007:0	For what gives you the right to make such a judgment ? What do you have that God has n't given you ? And if everything you have is from God , why boast as though it were not a gift ?
46:4:008:0	You think you already have everything you need . You think you are already rich . You have begun to reign in God 's kingdom without us ! I wish you really were reigning already , for then we would be reigning with you .
46:4:009:0	Instead , I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display , like prisoners of war at the end of a victor 's parade , condemned to die . We have become a spectacle to the entire world—to people and angels alike .
46:4:010:0	Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools , but you claim to be so wise in Christ ! We are weak , but you are so powerful ! You are honored , but we are ridiculed .
46:4:011:0	Even now we go hungry and thirsty , and we do n't have enough clothes to keep warm . We are often beaten and have no home .
46:4:012:0	We work wearily with our own hands to earn our living . We bless those who curse us . We are patient with those who abuse us .
46:4:013:0	We appeal gently when evil things are said about us . Yet we are treated like the world 's garbage , like everybody 's trash—right up to the present moment .
46:4:014:0	I am not writing these things to shame you , but to warn you as my beloved children .
46:4:015:0	For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ , you have only one spiritual father . For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you .
46:4:016:0	So I urge you to imitate me .
46:4:017:0	That 's why I have sent Timothy , my beloved and faithful child in the Lord . He will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus , just as I teach in all the churches wherever I go .
46:4:018:0	Some of you have become arrogant , thinking I will not visit you again .
46:4:019:0	But I will come—and soon—if the Lord lets me , and then I 'll find out whether these arrogant people just give pretentious speeches or whether they really have God 's power .
46:4:020:0	For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk ; it is living by God 's power .
46:4:021:0	Which do you choose ? Should I come with a rod to punish you , or should I come with love and a gentle spirit ?
