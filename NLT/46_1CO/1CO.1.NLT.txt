46:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
46:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from our brother Sosthenes .
46:1:002:0	I am writing to God 's church in Corinth , to you who have been called by God to be his own holy people . He made you holy by means of Christ Jesus , just as he did for all people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours .
46:1:002:1	Paul Gives Thanks to God
46:1:003:0	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
46:1:004:0	I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you , now that you belong to Christ Jesus .
46:1:005:0	Through him , God has enriched your church in every way — with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge .
46:1:006:0	This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true .
46:1:007:0	Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46:1:008:0	He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns .
46:1:003:1	Divisions in the Church
46:1:009:0	God will do this , for he is faithful to do what he says , and he has invited you into partnership with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46:1:010:0	I appeal to you , dear brothers and sisters , by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ , to live in harmony with each other . Let there be no divisions in the church . Rather , be of one mind , united in thought and purpose .
46:1:011:0	For some members of Chloe 's household have told me about your quarrels , my dear brothers and sisters .
46:1:012:0	Some of you are saying , “ I am a follower of Paul. ” Others are saying , “ I follow Apollos , ” or “ I follow Peter , ” or “ I follow only Christ . ”
46:1:013:0	Has Christ been divided into factions ? Was I , Paul , crucified for you ? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul ? Of course not !
46:1:014:0	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46:1:015:0	for now no one can say they were baptized in my name .
46:1:016:0	( Oh yes , I also baptized the household of Stephanas , but I do n't remember baptizing anyone else . )
46:1:004:1	The Wisdom of God
46:1:017:0	For Christ did n't send me to baptize , but to preach the Good News — and not with clever speech , for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power .
46:1:018:0	The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction ! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God .
46:1:019:0	As the Scriptures say , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wiseand discard the intelligence of the intelligent . ”
46:1:020:0	So where does this leave the philosophers , the scholars , and the world 's brilliant debaters ? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish .
46:1:021:0	Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom , he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe .
46:1:022:0	It is foolish to the Jews , who ask for signs from heaven . And it is foolish to the Greeks , who seek human wisdom .
46:1:023:0	So when we preach that Christ was crucified , the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it 's all nonsense .
46:1:024:0	But to those called by God to salvation , both Jews and Gentiles , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46:1:025:0	This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans , and God 's weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength .
46:1:026:0	Remember , dear brothers and sisters , that few of you were wise in the world 's eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you .
46:1:027:0	Instead , God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise . And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful .
46:1:028:0	God chose things despised by the world , things counted as nothing at all , and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important .
46:1:029:0	As a result , no one can ever boast in the presence of God .
46:1:030:0	God has united you with Christ Jesus . For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself . Christ made us right with God ; he made us pure and holy , and he freed us from sin .
46:1:031:0	Therefore , as the Scriptures say , “ If you want to boast , boast only about the Lord . ”
