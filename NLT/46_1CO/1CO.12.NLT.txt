46:12:001:1	Spiritual Gifts
46:12:001:0	Now , dear brothers and sisters , regarding your question about the special abilities the Spirit gives us . I do n't want you to misunderstand this .
46:12:002:0	You know that when you were still pagans , you were led astray and swept along in worshiping speechless idols .
46:12:003:0	So I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God will curse Jesus , and no one can say Jesus is Lord , except by the Holy Spirit .
46:12:004:0	There are different kinds of spiritual gifts , but the same Spirit is the source of them all .
46:12:005:0	There are different kinds of service , but we serve the same Lord .
46:12:006:0	God works in different ways , but it is the same God who does the work in all of us .
46:12:007:0	A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other .
46:12:008:0	To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice ; to another the same Spirit gives a message of special knowledge .
46:12:009:0	The same Spirit gives great faith to another , and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing .
46:12:010:0	He gives one person the power to perform miracles , and another the ability to prophesy . He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit . Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages , while another is given the ability to interpret what is being said .
46:12:002:1	One Body with Many Parts
46:12:011:0	It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts . He alone decides which gift each person should have .
46:12:012:0	The human body has many parts , but the many parts make up one whole body . So it is with the body of Christ .
46:12:013:0	Some of us are Jews , some are Gentiles , some are slaves , and some are free . But we have all been baptized into one body by one Spirit , and we all share the same Spirit .
46:12:014:0	Yes , the body has many different parts , not just one part .
46:12:015:0	If the foot says , “ I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand , ” that does not make it any less a part of the body .
46:12:016:0	And if the ear says , “ I am not part of the body because I am not an eye , ” would that make it any less a part of the body ?
46:12:017:0	If the whole body were an eye , how would you hear ? Or if your whole body were an ear , how would you smell anything ?
46:12:018:0	But our bodies have many parts , and God has put each part just where he wants it .
46:12:019:0	How strange a body would be if it had only one part !
46:12:020:0	Yes , there are many parts , but only one body .
46:12:021:0	The eye can never say to the hand , “ I do n't need you. ” The head ca n't say to the feet , “ I do n't need you . ”
46:12:022:0	In fact , some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary .
46:12:023:0	And the parts we regard as less honorable are those we clothe with the greatest care . So we carefully protect those parts that should not be seen ,
46:12:024:0	while the more honorable parts do not require this special care . So God has put the body together such that extra honor and care are given to those parts that have less dignity .
46:12:025:0	This makes for harmony among the members , so that all the members care for each other .
46:12:026:0	If one part suffers , all the parts suffer with it , and if one part is honored , all the parts are glad .
46:12:027:0	All of you together are Christ 's body , and each of you is a part of it .
46:12:028:0	Here are some of the parts God has appointed for the church : first are apostles , second are prophets , third are teachers , then those who do miracles , those who have the gift of healing , those who can help others , those who have the gift of leadership , those who speak in unknown languages .
46:12:029:0	Are we all apostles ? Are we all prophets ? Are we all teachers ? Do we all have the power to do miracles ?
46:12:030:0	Do we all have the gift of healing ? Do we all have the ability to speak in unknown languages ? Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages ? Of course not !
46:12:031:0	So you should earnestly desire the most helpful gifts.But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all .
