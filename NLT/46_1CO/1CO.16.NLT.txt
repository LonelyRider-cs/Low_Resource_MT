46:16:001:1	The Collection for Jerusalem
46:16:001:0	Now regarding your question about the money being collected for God 's people in Jerusalem . You should follow the same procedure I gave to the churches in Galatia .
46:16:002:0	On the first day of each week , you should each put aside a portion of the money you have earned . Do n't wait until I get there and then try to collect it all at once .
46:16:003:0	When I come , I will write letters of recommendation for the messengers you choose to deliver your gift to Jerusalem .
46:16:002:1	Paul 's Final Instructions
46:16:004:0	And if it seems appropriate for me to go along , they can travel with me .
46:16:005:0	I am coming to visit you after I have been to Macedonia , for I am planning to travel through Macedonia .
46:16:006:0	Perhaps I will stay awhile with you , possibly all winter , and then you can send me on my way to my next destination .
46:16:007:0	This time I do n't want to make just a short visit and then go right on . I want to come and stay awhile , if the Lord will let me .
46:16:008:0	In the meantime , I will be staying here at Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost .
46:16:009:0	There is a wide-open door for a great work here , although many oppose me .
46:16:010:0	When Timothy comes , do n't intimidate him . He is doing the Lord 's work , just as I am .
46:16:011:0	Do n't let anyone treat him with contempt . Send him on his way with your blessing when he returns to me . I expect him to come with the other believers .
46:16:012:0	Now about our brother Apollos—I urged him to visit you with the other believers , but he was not willing to go right now . He will see you later when he has the opportunity .
46:16:013:0	Be on guard . Stand firm in the faith . Be courageous . Be strong .
46:16:014:0	And do everything with love .
46:16:015:0	You know that Stephanas and his household were the first of the harvest of believers in Greece , and they are spending their lives in service to God 's people . I urge you , dear brothers and sisters ,
46:16:016:0	to submit to them and others like them who serve with such devotion .
46:16:017:0	I am very glad that Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus have come here . They have been providing the help you were n't here to give me .
46:16:003:1	Paul 's Final Greetings
46:16:018:0	They have been a wonderful encouragement to me , as they have been to you . You must show your appreciation to all who serve so well .
46:16:019:0	The churches here in the province of Asia send greetings in the Lord , as do Aquila and Priscilla and all the others who gather in their home for church meetings .
46:16:020:0	All the brothers and sisters here send greetings to you . Greet each other with a sacred kiss .
46:16:021:0	Here is my greeting in my own handwriting—Paul .
46:16:022:0	If anyone does not love the Lord , that person is cursed . Our Lord , come !
46:16:023:0	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46:16:024:0	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus .
