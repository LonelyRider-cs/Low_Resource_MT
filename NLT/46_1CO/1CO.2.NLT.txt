46:2:001:1	Paul 's Message of Wisdom
46:2:001:0	When I first came to you , dear brothers and sisters , I did n't use lofty words and impressive wisdom to tell you God 's secret plan .
46:2:002:0	For I decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Jesus Christ , the one who was crucified .
46:2:003:0	I came to you in weakness—timid and trembling .
46:2:004:0	And my message and my preaching were very plain . Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches , I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit .
46:2:005:0	I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God .
46:2:006:0	Yet when I am among mature believers , I do speak with words of wisdom , but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world , who are soon forgotten .
46:2:007:0	No , the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God—his plan that was previously hidden , even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began .
46:2:008:0	But the rulers of this world have not understood it ; if they had , they would not have crucified our glorious Lord .
46:2:009:0	That is what the Scriptures mean when they say , “ No eye has seen , no ear has heard , and no mind has imaginedwhat God has preparedfor those who love him . ”
46:2:010:0	But it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit . For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God 's deep secrets .
46:2:011:0	No one can know a person 's thoughts except that person 's own spirit , and no one can know God 's thoughts except God 's own Spirit .
46:2:012:0	And we have received God 's Spirit ( not the world 's spirit ) , so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us .
46:2:013:0	When we tell you these things , we do not use words that come from human wisdom . Instead , we speak words given to us by the Spirit , using the Spirit 's words to explain spiritual truths .
46:2:014:0	But people who are n't spiritual ca n't receive these truths from God 's Spirit . It all sounds foolish to them and they ca n't understand it , for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means .
46:2:015:0	Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things , but they themselves can not be evaluated by others .
46:2:016:0	For , “ Who can know the Lord 's thoughts ? Who knows enough to teach him ? ” But we understand these things , for we have the mind of Christ .
