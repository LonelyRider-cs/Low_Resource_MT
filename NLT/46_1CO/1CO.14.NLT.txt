46:14:001:1	Tongues and Prophecy
46:14:001:0	Let love be your highest goal ! But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives—especially the ability to prophesy .
46:14:002:0	For if you have the ability to speak in tongues , you will be talking only to God , since people wo n't be able to understand you . You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit , but it will all be mysterious .
46:14:003:0	But one who prophesies strengthens others , encourages them , and comforts them .
46:14:004:0	A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally , but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church .
46:14:005:0	I wish you could all speak in tongues , but even more I wish you could all prophesy . For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues , unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church will be strengthened .
46:14:006:0	Dear brothers and sisters , if I should come to you speaking in an unknown language , how would that help you ? But if I bring you a revelation or some special knowledge or prophecy or teaching , that will be helpful .
46:14:007:0	Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly , or no one will recognize the melody .
46:14:008:0	And if the bugler does n't sound a clear call , how will the soldiers know they are being called to battle ?
46:14:009:0	It 's the same for you . If you speak to people in words they do n't understand , how will they know what you are saying ? You might as well be talking into empty space .
46:14:010:0	There are many different languages in the world , and every language has meaning .
46:14:011:0	But if I do n't understand a language , I will be a foreigner to someone who speaks it , and the one who speaks it will be a foreigner to me .
46:14:012:0	And the same is true for you . Since you are so eager to have the special abilities the Spirit gives , seek those that will strengthen the whole church .
46:14:013:0	So anyone who speaks in tongues should pray also for the ability to interpret what has been said .
46:14:014:0	For if I pray in tongues , my spirit is praying , but I do n't understand what I am saying .
46:14:015:0	Well then , what shall I do ? I will pray in the spirit , and I will also pray in words I understand . I will sing in the spirit , and I will also sing in words I understand .
46:14:016:0	For if you praise God only in the spirit , how can those who do n't understand you praise God along with you ? How can they join you in giving thanks when they do n't understand what you are saying ?
46:14:017:0	You will be giving thanks very well , but it wo n't strengthen the people who hear you .
46:14:018:0	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you .
46:14:019:0	But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language .
46:14:020:0	Dear brothers and sisters , do n't be childish in your understanding of these things . Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil , but be mature in understanding matters of this kind .
46:14:021:0	It is written in the Scriptures : “ I will speak to my own peoplethrough strange languagesand through the lips of foreigners.But even then , they will not listen to me , ” says the Lord .
46:14:022:0	So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign , not for believers , but for unbelievers . Prophecy , however , is for the benefit of believers , not unbelievers .
46:14:023:0	Even so , if unbelievers or people who do n't understand these things come into your church meeting and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language , they will think you are crazy .
46:14:024:0	But if all of you are prophesying , and unbelievers or people who do n't understand these things come into your meeting , they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say .
46:14:002:1	A Call to Orderly Worship
46:14:025:0	As they listen , their secret thoughts will be exposed , and they will fall to their knees and worship God , declaring , “ God is truly here among you . ”
46:14:026:0	Well , my brothers and sisters , let 's summarize . When you meet together , one will sing , another will teach , another will tell some special revelation God has given , one will speak in tongues , and another will interpret what is said . But everything that is done must strengthen all of you .
46:14:027:0	No more than two or three should speak in tongues . They must speak one at a time , and someone must interpret what they say .
46:14:028:0	But if no one is present who can interpret , they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately .
46:14:029:0	Let two or three people prophesy , and let the others evaluate what is said .
46:14:030:0	But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord , the one who is speaking must stop .
46:14:031:0	In this way , all who prophesy will have a turn to speak , one after the other , so that everyone will learn and be encouraged .
46:14:032:0	Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can take turns .
46:14:033:0	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace , as in all the meetings of God 's holy people .
46:14:034:0	Women should be silent during the church meetings . It is not proper for them to speak . They should be submissive , just as the law says .
46:14:035:0	If they have any questions , they should ask their husbands at home , for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings .
46:14:036:0	Or do you think God 's word originated with you Corinthians ? Are you the only ones to whom it was given ?
46:14:037:0	If you claim to be a prophet or think you are spiritual , you should recognize that what I am saying is a command from the Lord himself .
46:14:038:0	But if you do not recognize this , you yourself will not be recognized .
46:14:039:0	So , my dear brothers and sisters , be eager to prophesy , and do n't forbid speaking in tongues .
46:14:040:0	But be sure that everything is done properly and in order .
