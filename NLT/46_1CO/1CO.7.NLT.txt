46:7:001:1	Instruction on Marriage
46:7:001:0	Now regarding the questions you asked in your letter . Yes , it is good to abstain from sexual relations .
46:7:002:0	But because there is so much sexual immorality , each man should have his own wife , and each woman should have her own husband .
46:7:003:0	The husband should fulfill his wife 's sexual needs , and the wife should fulfill her husband 's needs .
46:7:004:0	The wife gives authority over her body to her husband , and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife .
46:7:005:0	Do not deprive each other of sexual relations , unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer . Afterward , you should come together again so that Satan wo n't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46:7:006:0	I say this as a concession , not as a command .
46:7:007:0	But I wish everyone were single , just as I am . Yet each person has a special gift from God , of one kind or another .
46:7:008:0	So I say to those who are n't married and to widows — it 's better to stay unmarried , just as I am .
46:7:009:0	But if they ca n't control themselves , they should go ahead and marry . It 's better to marry than to burn with lust .
46:7:010:0	But for those who are married , I have a command that comes not from me , but from the Lord . A wife must not leave her husband .
46:7:011:0	But if she does leave him , let her remain single or else be reconciled to him . And the husband must not leave his wife .
46:7:012:0	Now , I will speak to the rest of you , though I do not have a direct command from the Lord . If a fellow believer has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to continue living with him , he must not leave her .
46:7:013:0	And if a believing woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to continue living with her , she must not leave him .
46:7:014:0	For the believing wife brings holiness to her marriage , and the believing husband brings holiness to his marriage . Otherwise , your children would not be holy , but now they are holy .
46:7:015:0	( But if the husband or wife who is n't a believer insists on leaving , let them go . In such cases the believing husband or wife is no longer bound to the other , for God has called you to live in peace . )
46:7:016:0	Do n't you wives realize that your husbands might be saved because of you ? And do n't you husbands realize that your wives might be saved because of you ?
46:7:017:0	Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you , and remain as you were when God first called you . This is my rule for all the churches .
46:7:018:0	For instance , a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it . And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now .
46:7:019:0	For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised . The important thing is to keep God 's commandments .
46:7:020:0	Yes , each of you should remain as you were when God called you .
46:7:021:0	Are you a slave ? Do n't let that worry you — but if you get a chance to be free , take it .
46:7:022:0	And remember , if you were a slave when the Lord called you , you are now free in the Lord . And if you were free when the Lord called you , you are now a slave of Christ .
46:7:023:0	God paid a high price for you , so do n't be enslaved by the world .
46:7:024:0	Each of you , dear brothers and sisters , should remain as you were when God first called you .
46:7:025:0	Now regarding your question about the young women who are not yet married . I do not have a command from the Lord for them . But the Lord in his mercy has given me wisdom that can be trusted , and I will share it with you .
46:7:026:0	Because of the present crisis , I think it is best to remain as you are .
46:7:027:0	If you have a wife , do not seek to end the marriage . If you do not have a wife , do not seek to get married .
46:7:028:0	But if you do get married , it is not a sin . And if a young woman gets married , it is not a sin . However , those who get married at this time will have troubles , and I am trying to spare you those problems .
46:7:029:0	But let me say this , dear brothers and sisters : The time that remains is very short . So from now on , those with wives should not focus only on their marriage .
46:7:030:0	Those who weep or who rejoice or who buy things should not be absorbed by their weeping or their joy or their possessions .
46:7:031:0	Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them . For this world as we know it will soon pass away .
46:7:032:0	I want you to be free from the concerns of this life . An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord 's work and thinking how to please him .
46:7:033:0	But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife .
46:7:034:0	His interests are divided . In the same way , a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit . But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband .
46:7:035:0	I am saying this for your benefit , not to place restrictions on you . I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best , with as few distractions as possible .
46:7:036:0	But if a man thinks that he 's treating his fiancée improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion , let him marry her as he wishes . It is not a sin .
46:7:037:0	But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion , he does well not to marry .
46:7:038:0	So the person who marries his fiancée does well , and the person who does n't marry does even better .
46:7:039:0	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . If her husband dies , she is free to marry anyone she wishes , but only if he loves the Lord .
46:7:040:0	But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single , and I think I am giving you counsel from God 's Spirit when I say this .
