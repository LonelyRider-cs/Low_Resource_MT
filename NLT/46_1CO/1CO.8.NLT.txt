46:8:001:1	Food Sacrificed to Idols
46:8:001:0	Now regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols . Yes , we know that “ we all have knowledge ” about this issue . But while knowledge makes us feel important , it is love that strengthens the church .
46:8:002:0	Anyone who claims to know all the answers does n't really know very much .
46:8:003:0	But the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes .
46:8:004:0	So , what about eating meat that has been offered to idols ? Well , we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God .
46:8:005:0	There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth , and some people actually worship many gods and many lords .
46:8:006:0	But for us , There is one God , the Father , by whom all things were created , and for whom we live.And there is one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom all things were created , and through whom we live .
46:8:007:0	However , not all believers know this . Some are accustomed to thinking of idols as being real , so when they eat food that has been offered to idols , they think of it as the worship of real gods , and their weak consciences are violated .
46:8:008:0	It 's true that we ca n't win God 's approval by what we eat . We do n't lose anything if we do n't eat it , and we do n't gain anything if we do .
46:8:009:0	But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble .
46:8:010:0	For if others see you — with your “ superior knowledge ” — eating in the temple of an idol , wo n't they be encouraged to violate their conscience by eating food that has been offered to an idol ?
46:8:011:0	So because of your superior knowledge , a weak believer for whom Christ died will be destroyed .
46:8:012:0	And when you sin against other believers by encouraging them to do something they believe is wrong , you are sinning against Christ .
46:8:013:0	So if what I eat causes another believer to sin , I will never eat meat again as long as I live — for I do n't want to cause another believer to stumble .
