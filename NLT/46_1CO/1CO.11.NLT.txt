46:11:001:1	Instructions for Public Worship
46:11:001:0	
46:11:002:0	I am so glad that you always keep me in your thoughts , and that you are following the teachings I passed on to you .
46:11:003:0	But there is one thing I want you to know : The head of every man is Christ , the head of woman is man , and the head of Christ is God .
46:11:004:0	A man dishonors his head if he covers his head while praying or prophesying .
46:11:005:0	But a woman dishonors her head if she prays or prophesies without a covering on her head , for this is the same as shaving her head .
46:11:006:0	Yes , if she refuses to wear a head covering , she should cut off all her hair ! But since it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved , she should wear a covering .
46:11:007:0	A man should not wear anything on his head when worshiping , for man is made in God 's image and reflects God 's glory . And woman reflects man 's glory .
46:11:008:0	For the first man did n't come from woman , but the first woman came from man .
46:11:009:0	And man was not made for woman , but woman was made for man .
46:11:010:0	For this reason , and because the angels are watching , a woman should wear a covering on her head to show she is under authority .
46:11:011:0	But among the Lord 's people , women are not independent of men , and men are not independent of women .
46:11:012:0	For although the first woman came from man , every other man was born from a woman , and everything comes from God .
46:11:013:0	Judge for yourselves . Is it right for a woman to pray to God in public without covering her head ?
46:11:014:0	Is n't it obvious that it 's disgraceful for a man to have long hair ?
46:11:015:0	And is n't long hair a woman 's pride and joy ? For it has been given to her as a covering .
46:11:002:1	Order at the Lord 's Supper
46:11:016:0	But if anyone wants to argue about this , I simply say that we have no other custom than this , and neither do God 's other churches .
46:11:017:0	But in the following instructions , I can not praise you . For it sounds as if more harm than good is done when you meet together .
46:11:018:0	First , I hear that there are divisions among you when you meet as a church , and to some extent I believe it .
46:11:019:0	But , of course , there must be divisions among you so that you who have God 's approval will be recognized !
46:11:020:0	When you meet together , you are not really interested in the Lord 's Supper .
46:11:021:0	For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others . As a result , some go hungry while others get drunk .
46:11:022:0	What ? Do n't you have your own homes for eating and drinking ? Or do you really want to disgrace God 's church and shame the poor ? What am I supposed to say ? Do you want me to praise you ? Well , I certainly will not praise you for this !
46:11:023:0	For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself . On the night when he was betrayed , the Lord Jesus took some bread
46:11:024:0	and gave thanks to God for it . Then he broke it in pieces and said , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
46:11:025:0	In the same way , he took the cup of wine after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant between God and his people — an agreement confirmed with my blood . Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it . ”
46:11:026:0	For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you are announcing the Lord 's death until he comes again .
46:11:027:0	So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord .
46:11:028:0	That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup .
46:11:029:0	For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honoring the body of Christ , you are eating and drinking God 's judgment upon yourself .
46:11:030:0	That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died .
46:11:031:0	But if we would examine ourselves , we would not be judged by God in this way .
46:11:032:0	Yet when we are judged by the Lord , we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned along with the world .
46:11:033:0	So , my dear brothers and sisters , when you gather for the Lord 's Supper , wait for each other .
46:11:034:0	If you are really hungry , eat at home so you wo n't bring judgment upon yourselves when you meet together . I 'll give you instructions about the other matters after I arrive .
