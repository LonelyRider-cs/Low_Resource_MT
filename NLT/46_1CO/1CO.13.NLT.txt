46:13:001:1	Love Is the Greatest
46:13:001:0	If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels , but did n't love others , I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46:13:002:0	If I had the gift of prophecy , and if I understood all of God 's secret plans and possessed all knowledge , and if I had such faith that I could move mountains , but did n't love others , I would be nothing .
46:13:003:0	If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body , I could boast about it ; but if I did n't love others , I would have gained nothing .
46:13:004:0	Love is patient and kind . Love is not jealous or boastful or proud
46:13:005:0	or rude . It does not demand its own way . It is not irritable , and it keeps no record of being wronged .
46:13:006:0	It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out .
46:13:007:0	Love never gives up , never loses faith , is always hopeful , and endures through every circumstance .
46:13:008:0	Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge will become useless . But love will last forever !
46:13:009:0	Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete , and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture !
46:13:010:0	But when the time of perfection comes , these partial things will become useless .
46:13:011:0	When I was a child , I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child . But when I grew up , I put away childish things .
46:13:012:0	Now we see things imperfectly , like puzzling reflections in a mirror , but then we will see everything with perfect clarity . All that I know now is partial and incomplete , but then I will know everything completely , just as God now knows me completely .
46:13:013:0	Three things will last forever—faith , hope , and love—and the greatest of these is love .
