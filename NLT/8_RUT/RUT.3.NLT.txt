8:3:001:1	Ruth at the Threshing Floor
8:3:001:0	One day Naomi said to Ruth , “ My daughter , it 's time that I found a permanent home for you , so that you will be provided for .
8:3:002:0	Boaz is a close relative of ours , and he 's been very kind by letting you gather grain with his young women . Tonight he will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor .
8:3:003:0	Now do as I tell you—take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes . Then go to the threshing floor , but do n't let Boaz see you until he has finished eating and drinking .
8:3:004:0	Be sure to notice where he lies down ; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there . He will tell you what to do . ”
8:3:005:0	“ I will do everything you say , ” Ruth replied .
8:3:006:0	So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed the instructions of her mother-in-law .
8:3:007:0	After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits , he lay down at the far end of the pile of grain and went to sleep . Then Ruth came quietly , uncovered his feet , and lay down .
8:3:008:0	Around midnight Boaz suddenly woke up and turned over . He was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet !
8:3:009:0	“ Who are you ? ” he asked. “ I am your servant Ruth , ” she replied . “ Spread the corner of your covering over me , for you are my family redeemer . ”
8:3:010:0	“ The Lord bless you , my daughter ! ” Boaz exclaimed . “ You are showing even more family loyalty now than you did before , for you have not gone after a younger man , whether rich or poor .
8:3:011:0	Now do n't worry about a thing , my daughter . I will do what is necessary , for everyone in town knows you are a virtuous woman .
8:3:012:0	But while it 's true that I am one of your family redeemers , there is another man who is more closely related to you than I am .
8:3:013:0	Stay here tonight , and in the morning I will talk to him . If he is willing to redeem you , very well . Let him marry you . But if he is not willing , then as surely as the Lord lives , I will redeem you myself ! Now lie down here until morning . ”
8:3:014:0	So Ruth lay at Boaz 's feet until the morning , but she got up before it was light enough for people to recognize each other . For Boaz had said , “ No one must know that a woman was here at the threshing floor . ”
8:3:015:0	Then Boaz said to her , “ Bring your cloak and spread it out. ” He measured six scoops of barley into the cloak and placed it on her back . Then he returned to the town .
8:3:016:0	When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law , Naomi asked , “ What happened , my daughter ? ” Ruth told Naomi everything Boaz had done for her ,
8:3:017:0	and she added , “ He gave me these six scoops of barley and said , ‘ Do n't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed . ' ”
8:3:018:0	Then Naomi said to her , “ Just be patient , my daughter , until we hear what happens . The man wo n't rest until he has settled things today . ”
