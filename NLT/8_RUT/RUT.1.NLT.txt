8:1:001:1	Elimelech Moves His Family to Moab
8:1:001:0	In the days when the judges ruled in Israel , a severe famine came upon the land . So a man from Bethlehem in Judah left his home and went to live in the country of Moab , taking his wife and two sons with him .
8:1:002:0	The man 's name was Elimelech , and his wife was Naomi . Their two sons were Mahlon and Kilion . They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in the land of Judah . And when they reached Moab , they settled there .
8:1:003:0	Then Elimelech died , and Naomi was left with her two sons .
8:1:004:0	The two sons married Moabite women . One married a woman named Orpah , and the other a woman named Ruth . But about ten years later ,
8:1:002:1	Naomi and Ruth Return
8:1:005:0	both Mahlon and Kilion died . This left Naomi alone , without her two sons or her husband .
8:1:006:0	Then Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had blessed his people in Judah by giving them good crops again . So Naomi and her daughters-in-law got ready to leave Moab to return to her homeland .
8:1:007:0	With her two daughters-in-law she set out from the place where she had been living , and they took the road that would lead them back to Judah .
8:1:008:0	But on the way , Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , “ Go back to your mothers ' homes . And may the Lord reward you for your kindness to your husbands and to me .
8:1:009:0	May the Lord bless you with the security of another marriage. ” Then she kissed them good-bye , and they all broke down and wept .
8:1:010:0	“ No , ” they said . “ We want to go with you to your people . ”
8:1:011:0	But Naomi replied , “ Why should you go on with me ? Can I still give birth to other sons who could grow up to be your husbands ?
8:1:012:0	No , my daughters , return to your parents ' homes , for I am too old to marry again . And even if it were possible , and I were to get married tonight and bear sons , then what ?
8:1:013:0	Would you wait for them to grow up and refuse to marry someone else ? No , of course not , my daughters ! Things are far more bitter for me than for you , because the Lord himself has raised his fist against me . ”
8:1:014:0	And again they wept together , and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye . But Ruth clung tightly to Naomi .
8:1:015:0	“ Look , ” Naomi said to her , “ your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods . You should do the same . ”
8:1:016:0	But Ruth replied , “ Do n't ask me to leave you and turn back . Wherever you go , I will go ; wherever you live , I will live . Your people will be my people , and your God will be my God .
8:1:017:0	Wherever you die , I will die , and there I will be buried . May the Lord punish me severely if I allow anything but death to separate us ! ”
8:1:018:0	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her , she said nothing more .
8:1:019:0	So the two of them continued on their journey . When they came to Bethlehem , the entire town was excited by their arrival . “ Is it really Naomi ? ” the women asked .
8:1:020:0	“ Do n't call me Naomi , ” she responded . “ Instead , call me Mara , for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me .
8:1:021:0	I went away full , but the Lord has brought me home empty . Why call me Naomi when the Lord has caused me to suffer and the Almighty has sent such tragedy upon me ? ”
8:1:022:0	So Naomi returned from Moab , accompanied by her daughter-in-law Ruth , the young Moabite woman . They arrived in Bethlehem in late spring , at the beginning of the barley harvest .
