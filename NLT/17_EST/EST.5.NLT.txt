17:5:001:0	On the third day of the fast , Esther put on her royal robes and entered the inner court of the palace , just across from the king 's hall . The king was sitting on his royal throne , facing the entrance .
17:5:002:0	When he saw Queen Esther standing there in the inner court , he welcomed her and held out the gold scepter to her . So Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter .
17:5:003:0	Then the king asked her , “ What do you want , Queen Esther ? What is your request ? I will give it to you , even if it is half the kingdom ! ”
17:5:004:0	And Esther replied , “ If it please the king , let the king and Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for the king . ”
17:5:005:0	The king turned to his attendants and said , “ Tell Haman to come quickly to a banquet , as Esther has requested. ” So the king and Haman went to Esther 's banquet .
17:5:006:0	And while they were drinking wine , the king said to Esther , “ Now tell me what you really want . What is your request ? I will give it to you , even if it is half the kingdom ! ”
17:5:007:0	Esther replied , “ This is my request and deepest wish .
17:5:002:1	Haman 's Plan to Kill Mordecai
17:5:008:0	If I have found favor with the king , and if it pleases the king to grant my request and do what I ask , please come with Haman tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for you . Then I will explain what this is all about . ”
17:5:009:0	Haman was a happy man as he left the banquet ! But when he saw Mordecai sitting at the palace gate , not standing up or trembling nervously before him , Haman became furious .
17:5:010:0	However , he restrained himself and went on home.Then Haman gathered together his friends and Zeresh , his wife ,
17:5:011:0	and boasted to them about his great wealth and his many children . He bragged about the honors the king had given him and how he had been promoted over all the other nobles and officials .
17:5:012:0	Then Haman added , “ And that 's not all ! Queen Esther invited only me and the king himself to the banquet she prepared for us . And she has invited me to dine with her and the king again tomorrow ! ”
17:5:013:0	Then he added , “ But this is all worth nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew just sitting there at the palace gate . ”
17:5:014:0	So Haman 's wife , Zeresh , and all his friends suggested , “ Set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet tall , and in the morning ask the king to impale Mordecai on it . When this is done , you can go on your merry way to the banquet with the king. ” This pleased Haman , and he ordered the pole set up .
