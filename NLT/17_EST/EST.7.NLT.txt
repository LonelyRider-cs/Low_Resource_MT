17:7:001:1	The King Executes Haman
17:7:001:0	So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther 's banquet .
17:7:002:0	On this second occasion , while they were drinking wine , the king again said to Esther , “ Tell me what you want , Queen Esther . What is your request ? I will give it to you , even if it is half the kingdom ! ”
17:7:003:0	Queen Esther replied , “ If I have found favor with the king , and if it pleases the king to grant my request , I ask that my life and the lives of my people will be spared .
17:7:004:0	For my people and I have been sold to those who would kill , slaughter , and annihilate us . If we had merely been sold as slaves , I could remain quiet , for that would be too trivial a matter to warrant disturbing the king . ”
17:7:005:0	“ Who would do such a thing ? ” King Xerxes demanded . “ Who would be so presumptuous as to touch you ? ”
17:7:006:0	Esther replied , “ This wicked Haman is our adversary and our enemy. ” Haman grew pale with fright before the king and queen .
17:7:007:0	Then the king jumped to his feet in a rage and went out into the palace garden.Haman , however , stayed behind to plead for his life with Queen Esther , for he knew that the king intended to kill him .
17:7:008:0	In despair he fell on the couch where Queen Esther was reclining , just as the king was returning from the palace garden.The king exclaimed , “ Will he even assault the queen right here in the palace , before my very eyes ? ” And as soon as the king spoke , his attendants covered Haman 's face , signaling his doom .
17:7:009:0	Then Harbona , one of the king 's eunuchs , said , “ Haman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet tall in his own courtyard . He intended to use it to impale Mordecai , the man who saved the king from assassination. ” “ Then impale Haman on it ! ” the king ordered .
17:7:010:0	So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai , and the king 's anger subsided .
