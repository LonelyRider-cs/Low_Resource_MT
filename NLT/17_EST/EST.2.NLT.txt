17:2:001:1	Esther Becomes Queen
17:2:001:0	But after Xerxes ' anger had subsided , he began thinking about Vashti and what she had done and the decree he had made .
17:2:002:0	So his personal attendants suggested , “ Let us search the empire to find beautiful young virgins for the king .
17:2:003:0	Let the king appoint agents in each province to bring these beautiful young women into the royal harem at the fortress of Susa . Hegai , the king 's eunuch in charge of the harem , will see that they are all given beauty treatments .
17:2:004:0	After that , the young woman who most pleases the king will be made queen instead of Vashti. ” This advice was very appealing to the king , so he put the plan into effect .
17:2:005:0	At that time there was a Jewish man in the fortress of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair . He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei .
17:2:006:0	His family had been among those who , with King Jehoiachin of Judah , had been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar .
17:2:007:0	This man had a very beautiful and lovely young cousin , Hadassah , who was also called Esther . When her father and mother died , Mordecai adopted her into his family and raised her as his own daughter .
17:2:008:0	As a result of the king 's decree , Esther , along with many other young women , was brought to the king 's harem at the fortress of Susa and placed in Hegai 's care .
17:2:009:0	Hegai was very impressed with Esther and treated her kindly . He quickly ordered a special menu for her and provided her with beauty treatments . He also assigned her seven maids specially chosen from the king 's palace , and he moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem .
17:2:010:0	Esther had not told anyone of her nationality and family background , because Mordecai had directed her not to do so .
17:2:011:0	Every day Mordecai would take a walk near the courtyard of the harem to find out about Esther and what was happening to her .
17:2:012:0	Before each young woman was taken to the king 's bed , she was given the prescribed twelve months of beauty treatments — six months with oil of myrrh , followed by six months with special perfumes and ointments .
17:2:013:0	When it was time for her to go to the king 's palace , she was given her choice of whatever clothing or jewelry she wanted to take from the harem .
17:2:014:0	That evening she was taken to the king 's private rooms , and the next morning she was brought to the second harem , where the king 's wives lived . There she would be under the care of Shaashgaz , the king 's eunuch in charge of the concubines . She would never go to the king again unless he had especially enjoyed her and requested her by name .
17:2:015:0	Esther was the daughter of Abihail , who was Mordecai 's uncle . ( Mordecai had adopted his younger cousin Esther . ) When it was Esther 's turn to go to the king , she accepted the advice of Hegai , the eunuch in charge of the harem . She asked for nothing except what he suggested , and she was admired by everyone who saw her .
17:2:016:0	Esther was taken to King Xerxes at the royal palace in early winter of the seventh year of his reign .
17:2:017:0	And the king loved Esther more than any of the other young women . He was so delighted with her that he set the royal crown on her head and declared her queen instead of Vashti .
17:2:018:0	To celebrate the occasion , he gave a great banquet in Esther 's honor for all his nobles and officials , declaring a public holiday for the provinces and giving generous gifts to everyone .
17:2:019:0	Even after all the young women had been transferred to the second harem and Mordecai had become a palace official ,
17:2:002:1	Mordecai 's Loyalty to the King
17:2:020:0	Esther continued to keep her family background and nationality a secret . She was still following Mordecai 's directions , just as she did when she lived in his home .
17:2:021:0	One day as Mordecai was on duty at the king 's gate , two of the king 's eunuchs , Bigthana and Teresh — who were guards at the door of the king 's private quarters — became angry at King Xerxes and plotted to assassinate him .
17:2:022:0	But Mordecai heard about the plot and gave the information to Queen Esther . She then told the king about it and gave Mordecai credit for the report .
17:2:023:0	When an investigation was made and Mordecai 's story was found to be true , the two men were impaled on a sharpened pole . This was all recorded in The Book of the History of King Xerxes ' Reign .
