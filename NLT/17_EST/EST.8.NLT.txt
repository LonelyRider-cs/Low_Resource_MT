17:8:001:1	A Decree to Help the Jews
17:8:001:0	On that same day King Xerxes gave the property of Haman , the enemy of the Jews , to Queen Esther . Then Mordecai was brought before the king , for Esther had told the king how they were related .
17:8:002:0	The king took off his signet ring—which he had taken back from Haman—and gave it to Mordecai . And Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of Haman 's property .
17:8:003:0	Then Esther went again before the king , falling down at his feet and begging him with tears to stop the evil plot devised by Haman the Agagite against the Jews .
17:8:004:0	Again the king held out the gold scepter to Esther . So she rose and stood before him .
17:8:005:0	Esther said , “ If it please the king , and if I have found favor with him , and if he thinks it is right , and if I am pleasing to him , let there be a decree that reverses the orders of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite , who ordered that Jews throughout all the king 's provinces should be destroyed .
17:8:006:0	For how can I endure to see my people and my family slaughtered and destroyed ? ”
17:8:007:0	Then King Xerxes said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew , “ I have given Esther the property of Haman , and he has been impaled on a pole because he tried to destroy the Jews .
17:8:008:0	Now go ahead and send a message to the Jews in the king 's name , telling them whatever you want , and seal it with the king 's signet ring . But remember that whatever has already been written in the king 's name and sealed with his signet ring can never be revoked . ”
17:8:009:0	So on June 25 the king 's secretaries were summoned , and a decree was written exactly as Mordecai dictated . It was sent to the Jews and to the highest officers , the governors , and the nobles of all the 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia . The decree was written in the scripts and languages of all the peoples of the empire , including that of the Jews .
17:8:010:0	The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king 's signet ring . Mordecai sent the dispatches by swift messengers , who rode fast horses especially bred for the king 's service .
17:8:011:0	The king 's decree gave the Jews in every city authority to unite to defend their lives . They were allowed to kill , slaughter , and annihilate anyone of any nationality or province who might attack them or their children and wives , and to take the property of their enemies .
17:8:012:0	The day chosen for this event throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes was March 7 of the next year .
17:8:013:0	A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples , so that the Jews would be ready to take revenge on their enemies on the appointed day .
17:8:014:0	So urged on by the king 's command , the messengers rode out swiftly on fast horses bred for the king 's service . The same decree was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa .
17:8:015:0	Then Mordecai left the king 's presence , wearing the royal robe of blue and white , the great crown of gold , and an outer cloak of fine linen and purple . And the people of Susa celebrated the new decree .
17:8:016:0	The Jews were filled with joy and gladness and were honored everywhere .
17:8:017:0	In every province and city , wherever the king 's decree arrived , the Jews rejoiced and had a great celebration and declared a public festival and holiday . And many of the people of the land became Jews themselves , for they feared what the Jews might do to them .
