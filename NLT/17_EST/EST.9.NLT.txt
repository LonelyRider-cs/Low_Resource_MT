17:9:001:1	The Victory of the Jews
17:9:001:0	So on March 7 the two decrees of the king were put into effect . On that day , the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them , but quite the opposite happened . It was the Jews who overpowered their enemies .
17:9:002:0	The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king 's provinces to attack anyone who tried to harm them . But no one could make a stand against them , for everyone was afraid of them .
17:9:003:0	And all the nobles of the provinces , the highest officers , the governors , and the royal officials helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai .
17:9:004:0	For Mordecai had been promoted in the king 's palace , and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as he became more and more powerful .
17:9:005:0	So the Jews went ahead on the appointed day and struck down their enemies with the sword . They killed and annihilated their enemies and did as they pleased with those who hated them .
17:9:006:0	In the fortress of Susa itself , the Jews killed 500 men .
17:9:007:0	They also killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
17:9:008:0	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
17:9:009:0	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vaizatha—
17:9:010:0	the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews . But they did not take any plunder .
17:9:011:0	That very day , when the king was informed of the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa ,
17:9:012:0	he called for Queen Esther . He said , “ The Jews have killed 500 men in the fortress of Susa alone , as well as Haman 's ten sons . If they have done that here , what has happened in the rest of the provinces ? But now , what more do you want ? It will be granted to you ; tell me and I will do it . ”
17:9:013:0	Esther responded , “ If it please the king , give the Jews in Susa permission to do again tomorrow as they have done today , and let the bodies of Haman 's ten sons be impaled on a pole . ”
17:9:014:0	So the king agreed , and the decree was announced in Susa . And they impaled the bodies of Haman 's ten sons .
17:9:015:0	Then the Jews at Susa gathered together on March 8 and killed 300 more men , and again they took no plunder .
17:9:016:0	Meanwhile , the other Jews throughout the king 's provinces had gathered together to defend their lives . They gained relief from all their enemies , killing 75,000 of those who hated them . But they did not take any plunder .
17:9:017:0	This was done throughout the provinces on March 7 , and on March 8 they rested , celebrating their victory with a day of feasting and gladness .
17:9:018:0	( The Jews at Susa killed their enemies on March 7 and again on March 8 , then rested on March 9 , making that their day of feasting and gladness . )
17:9:002:1	The Festival of Purim
17:9:019:0	So to this day , rural Jews living in remote villages celebrate an annual festival and holiday on the appointed day in late winter , when they rejoice and send gifts of food to each other .
17:9:020:0	Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to the Jews near and far , throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes ,
17:9:021:0	calling on them to celebrate an annual festival on these two days .
17:9:022:0	He told them to celebrate these days with feasting and gladness and by giving gifts of food to each other and presents to the poor . This would commemorate a time when the Jews gained relief from their enemies , when their sorrow was turned into gladness and their mourning into joy .
17:9:023:0	So the Jews accepted Mordecai 's proposal and adopted this annual custom .
17:9:024:0	Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the enemy of the Jews , had plotted to crush and destroy them on the date determined by casting lots ( the lots were called purim ) .
17:9:025:0	But when Esther came before the king , he issued a decree causing Haman 's evil plot to backfire , and Haman and his sons were impaled on a sharpened pole .
17:9:026:0	That is why this celebration is called Purim , because it is the ancient word for casting lots.So because of Mordecai 's letter and because of what they had experienced ,
17:9:027:0	the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews . They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year .
17:9:028:0	These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire . This Festival of Purim would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews , nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants .
17:9:029:0	Then Queen Esther , the daughter of Abihail , along with Mordecai the Jew , wrote another letter putting the queen 's full authority behind Mordecai 's letter to establish the Festival of Purim .
17:9:030:0	Letters wishing peace and security were sent to the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of the empire of Xerxes .
17:9:031:0	These letters established the Festival of Purim—an annual celebration of these days at the appointed time , decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther . ( The people decided to observe this festival , just as they had decided for themselves and their descendants to establish the times of fasting and mourning . )
17:9:032:0	So the command of Esther confirmed the practices of Purim , and it was all written down in the records .
