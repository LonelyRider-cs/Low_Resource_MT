20:6:001:1	Lessons for Daily Life
20:6:001:0	My child , if you have put up security for a friend 's debtor agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger—
20:6:002:0	if you have trapped yourself by your agreementand are caught by what you said—
20:6:003:0	follow my advice and save yourself , for you have placed yourself at your friend 's mercy.Now swallow your pride ; go and beg to have your name erased .
20:6:004:0	Do n't put it off ; do it now ! Do n't rest until you do .
20:6:005:0	Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter , like a bird fleeing from a net .
20:6:006:0	Take a lesson from the ants , you lazybones.Learn from their ways and become wise !
20:6:007:0	Though they have no princeor governor or ruler to make them work ,
20:6:008:0	they labor hard all summer , gathering food for the winter .
20:6:009:0	But you , lazybones , how long will you sleep ? When will you wake up ?
20:6:010:0	A little extra sleep , a little more slumber , a little folding of the hands to rest—
20:6:011:0	then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit ; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber .
20:6:012:0	What are worthless and wicked people like ? They are constant liars ,
20:6:013:0	signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye , a nudge of the foot , or the wiggle of fingers .
20:6:014:0	Their perverted hearts plot evil , and they constantly stir up trouble .
20:6:015:0	But they will be destroyed suddenly , broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing .
20:6:016:0	There are six things the Lord hates—no , seven things he detests :
20:6:017:0	haughty eyes , a lying tongue , hands that kill the innocent ,
20:6:018:0	a heart that plots evil , feet that race to do wrong ,
20:6:019:0	a false witness who pours out lies , a person who sows discord in a family .
20:6:020:0	My son , obey your father 's commands , and do n't neglect your mother 's instruction .
20:6:021:0	Keep their words always in your heart.Tie them around your neck .
20:6:022:0	When you walk , their counsel will lead you.When you sleep , they will protect you.When you wake up , they will advise you .
20:6:023:0	For their command is a lampand their instruction a light ; their corrective disciplineis the way to life .
20:6:024:0	It will keep you from the immoral woman , from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman .
20:6:025:0	Do n't lust for her beauty.Do n't let her coy glances seduce you .
20:6:026:0	For a prostitute will bring you to poverty , but sleeping with another man 's wife will cost you your life .
20:6:027:0	Can a man scoop a flame into his lapand not have his clothes catch on fire ?
20:6:028:0	Can he walk on hot coalsand not blister his feet ?
20:6:029:0	So it is with the man who sleeps with another man 's wife.He who embraces her will not go unpunished .
20:6:030:0	Excuses might be found for a thiefwho steals because he is starving .
20:6:031:0	But if he is caught , he must pay back seven times what he stole , even if he has to sell everything in his house .
20:6:032:0	But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool , for he destroys himself .
20:6:033:0	He will be wounded and disgraced.His shame will never be erased .
20:6:034:0	For the woman 's jealous husband will be furious , and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge .
20:6:035:0	He will accept no compensation , nor be satisfied with a payoff of any size .
