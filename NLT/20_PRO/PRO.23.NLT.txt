20:23:001:0	While dining with a ruler , pay attention to what is put before you .
20:23:002:0	If you are a big eater , put a knife to your throat ;
20:23:003:0	do n't desire all the delicacies , for he might be trying to trick you .
20:23:004:0	Do n't wear yourself out trying to get rich.Be wise enough to know when to quit .
20:23:005:0	In the blink of an eye wealth disappears , for it will sprout wingsand fly away like an eagle .
20:23:006:0	Do n't eat with people who are stingy ; do n't desire their delicacies .
20:23:007:0	They are always thinking about how much it costs. “ Eat and drink , ” they say , but they do n't mean it .
20:23:008:0	You will throw up what little you 've eaten , and your compliments will be wasted .
20:23:009:0	Do n't waste your breath on fools , for they will despise the wisest advice .
20:23:010:0	Do n't cheat your neighbor by moving the ancient boundary markers ; do n't take the land of defenseless orphans .
20:23:011:0	For their Redeemer is strong ; he himself will bring their charges against you .
20:23:012:0	Commit yourself to instruction ; listen carefully to words of knowledge .
20:23:013:0	Do n't fail to discipline your children.The rod of punishment wo n't kill them .
20:23:014:0	Physical disciplinemay well save them from death .
20:23:015:0	My child , if your heart is wise , my own heart will rejoice !
20:23:016:0	Everything in me will celebratewhen you speak what is right .
20:23:017:0	Do n't envy sinners , but always continue to fear the Lord .
20:23:018:0	You will be rewarded for this ; your hope will not be disappointed .
20:23:019:0	My child , listen and be wise : Keep your heart on the right course .
20:23:020:0	Do not carouse with drunkardsor feast with gluttons ,
20:23:021:0	for they are on their way to poverty , and too much sleep clothes them in rags .
20:23:022:0	Listen to your father , who gave you life , and do n't despise your mother when she is old .
20:23:023:0	Get the truth and never sell it ; also get wisdom , discipline , and good judgment .
20:23:024:0	The father of godly children has cause for joy.What a pleasure to have children who are wise .
20:23:025:0	So give your father and mother joy ! May she who gave you birth be happy .
20:23:026:0	O my son , give me your heart.May your eyes take delight in following my ways .
20:23:027:0	A prostitute is a dangerous trap ; a promiscuous woman is as dangerous as falling into a narrow well .
20:23:028:0	She hides and waits like a robber , eager to make more men unfaithful .
20:23:029:0	Who has anguish ? Who has sorrow ? Who is always fighting ? Who is always complaining ? Who has unnecessary bruises ? Who has bloodshot eyes ?
20:23:030:0	It is the one who spends long hours in the taverns , trying out new drinks .
20:23:031:0	Do n't gaze at the wine , seeing how red it is , how it sparkles in the cup , how smoothly it goes down .
20:23:032:0	For in the end it bites like a poisonous snake ; it stings like a viper .
20:23:033:0	You will see hallucinations , and you will say crazy things .
20:23:034:0	You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea , clinging to a swaying mast .
20:23:035:0	And you will say , “ They hit me , but I did n't feel it.I did n't even know it when they beat me up.When will I wake upso I can look for another drink ? ”
