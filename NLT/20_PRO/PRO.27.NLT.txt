20:27:002:0	Let someone else praise you , not your own mouth—a stranger , not your own lips .
20:27:003:0	A stone is heavy and sand is weighty , but the resentment caused by a fool is even heavier .
20:27:004:0	Anger is cruel , and wrath is like a flood , but jealousy is even more dangerous .

20:27:007:0	A person who is full refuses honey , but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry .
20:27:008:0	A person who strays from homeis like a bird that strays from its nest .
20:27:009:0	The heartfelt counsel of a friendis as sweet as perfume and incense .
20:27:010:0	Never abandon a friend—either yours or your father's.When disaster strikes , you wo n't have to ask your brother for assistance.It 's better to go to a neighbor than to a brother who lives far away .

20:27:019:0	As a face is reflected in water , so the heart reflects the real person .
20:27:020:0	Just as Death and Destruction are never satisfied , so human desire is never satisfied .
20:27:021:0	Fire tests the purity of silver and gold , but a person is tested by being praised .
20:27:022:0	You can not separate fools from their foolishness , even though you grind them like grain with mortar and pestle .
20:27:023:0	Know the state of your flocks , and put your heart into caring for your herds ,
20:27:024:0	for riches do n't last forever , and the crown might not be passed to the next generation .
20:27:025:0	After the hay is harvested and the new crop appearsand the mountain grasses are gathered in ,
20:27:026:0	your sheep will provide wool for clothing , and your goats will provide the price of a field .
20:27:027:0	And you will have enough goats ' milk for yourself , your family , and your servant girls .
