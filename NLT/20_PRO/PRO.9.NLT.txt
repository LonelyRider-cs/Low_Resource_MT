20:9:001:0	Wisdom has built her house ; she has carved its seven columns .
20:9:002:0	She has prepared a great banquet , mixed the wines , and set the table .
20:9:003:0	She has sent her servants to invite everyone to come.She calls out from the heights overlooking the city .
20:9:004:0	“ Come in with me , ” she urges the simple.To those who lack good judgment , she says ,
20:9:005:0	“ Come , eat my food , and drink the wine I have mixed .
20:9:006:0	Leave your simple ways behind , and begin to live ; learn to use good judgment . ”
20:9:007:0	Anyone who rebukes a mocker will get an insult in return.Anyone who corrects the wicked will get hurt .
20:9:008:0	So do n't bother correcting mockers ; they will only hate you.But correct the wise , and they will love you .
20:9:009:0	Instruct the wise , and they will be even wiser.Teach the righteous , and they will learn even more .
20:9:010:0	Fear of the Lord is the foundation of wisdom.Knowledge of the Holy One results in good judgment .
20:9:011:0	Wisdom will multiply your daysand add years to your life .
20:9:001:1	Folly Calls for a Hearing
20:9:012:0	If you become wise , you will be the one to benefit.If you scorn wisdom , you will be the one to suffer .
20:9:013:0	The woman named Folly is brash.She is ignorant and does n't know it .
20:9:014:0	She sits in her doorwayon the heights overlooking the city .
20:9:015:0	She calls out to men going bywho are minding their own business .
20:9:016:0	“ Come in with me , ” she urges the simple.To those who lack good judgment , she says ,
20:9:017:0	“ Stolen water is refreshing ; food eaten in secret tastes the best ! ”
20:9:018:0	But little do they know that the dead are there.Her guests are in the depths of the grave .
