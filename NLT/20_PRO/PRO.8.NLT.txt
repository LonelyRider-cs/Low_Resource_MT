20:8:001:1	Wisdom Calls for a Hearing
20:8:001:0	Listen as Wisdom calls out ! Hear as understanding raises her voice !
20:8:002:0	On the hilltop along the road , she takes her stand at the crossroads .
20:8:003:0	By the gates at the entrance to the town , on the road leading in , she cries aloud ,
20:8:004:0	“ I call to you , to all of you ! I raise my voice to all people .
20:8:005:0	You simple people , use good judgment.You foolish people , show some understanding .
20:8:006:0	Listen to me ! For I have important things to tell you.Everything I say is right ,
20:8:007:0	for I speak the truthand detest every kind of deception .
20:8:008:0	My advice is wholesome.There is nothing devious or crooked in it .
20:8:009:0	My words are plain to anyone with understanding , clear to those with knowledge .
20:8:010:0	Choose my instruction rather than silver , and knowledge rather than pure gold .
20:8:011:0	For wisdom is far more valuable than rubies.Nothing you desire can compare with it .
20:8:012:0	“ I , Wisdom , live together with good judgment.I know where to discover knowledge and discernment .
20:8:013:0	All who fear the Lord will hate evil.Therefore , I hate pride and arrogance , corruption and perverse speech .
20:8:014:0	Common sense and success belong to me.Insight and strength are mine .
20:8:015:0	Because of me , kings reign , and rulers make just decrees .
20:8:016:0	Rulers lead with my help , and nobles make righteous judgments .
20:8:017:0	“ I love all who love me.Those who search will surely find me .
20:8:018:0	I have riches and honor , as well as enduring wealth and justice .
20:8:019:0	My gifts are better than gold , even the purest gold , my wages better than sterling silver !
20:8:020:0	I walk in righteousness , in paths of justice .
20:8:021:0	Those who love me inherit wealth.I will fill their treasuries .
20:8:022:0	“ The Lord formed me from the beginning , before he created anything else .
20:8:023:0	I was appointed in ages past , at the very first , before the earth began .
20:8:024:0	I was born before the oceans were created , before the springs bubbled forth their waters .
20:8:025:0	Before the mountains were formed , before the hills , I was born—
20:8:026:0	before he had made the earth and fieldsand the first handfuls of soil .
20:8:027:0	I was there when he established the heavens , when he drew the horizon on the oceans .
20:8:028:0	I was there when he set the clouds above , when he established springs deep in the earth .
20:8:029:0	I was there when he set the limits of the seas , so they would not spread beyond their boundaries.And when he marked off the earth 's foundations ,
20:8:030:0	I was the architect at his side.I was his constant delight , rejoicing always in his presence .
20:8:031:0	And how happy I was with the world he created ; how I rejoiced with the human family !
20:8:032:0	“ And so , my children , listen to me , for all who follow my ways are joyful .
20:8:033:0	Listen to my instruction and be wise.Do n't ignore it .
20:8:034:0	Joyful are those who listen to me , watching for me daily at my gates , waiting for me outside my home !
20:8:035:0	For whoever finds me finds lifeand receives favor from the Lord .
20:8:036:0	But those who miss me injure themselves.All who hate me love death . ”
