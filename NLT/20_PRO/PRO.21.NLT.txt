20:21:006:0	Wealth created by a lying tongueis a vanishing mist and a deadly trap .
20:21:007:0	The violence of the wicked sweeps them away , because they refuse to do what is just .
20:21:008:0	The guilty walk a crooked path ; the innocent travel a straight road .
20:21:009:0	It 's better to live alone in the corner of an atticthan with a quarrelsome wife in a lovely home .
20:21:010:0	Evil people desire evil ; their neighbors get no mercy from them .

20:21:012:0	The Righteous One knows what is going on in the homes of the wicked ; he will bring disaster on them .
20:21:013:0	Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poorwill be ignored in their own time of need .

20:21:023:0	Watch your tongue and keep your mouth shut , and you will stay out of trouble .
20:21:024:0	Mockers are proud and haughty ; they act with boundless arrogance .
20:21:025:0	Despite their desires , the lazy will come to ruin , for their hands refuse to work .
20:21:026:0	Some people are always greedy for more , but the godly love to give !
20:21:027:0	The sacrifice of an evil person is detestable , especially when it is offered with wrong motives .
20:21:028:0	A false witness will be cut off , but a credible witness will be allowed to speak .
20:21:029:0	The wicked bluff their way through , but the virtuous think before they act .
20:21:030:0	No human wisdom or understanding or plancan stand against the Lord .
20:21:031:0	The horse is prepared for the day of battle , but the victory belongs to the Lord .
