20:24:006:0	So do n't go to war without wise guidance ; victory depends on having many advisers .
20:24:007:0	Wisdom is too lofty for fools.Among leaders at the city gate , they have nothing to say .

20:24:015:0	Do n't wait in ambush at the home of the godly , and do n't raid the house where the godly live .
20:24:016:0	The godly may trip seven times , but they will get up again.But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked .
20:24:017:0	Do n't rejoice when your enemies fall ; do n't be happy when they stumble .
20:24:018:0	For the Lord will be displeased with youand will turn his anger away from them .
20:24:019:0	Do n't fret because of evildoers ; do n't envy the wicked .

20:24:001:1	More Sayings of the Wise
20:24:022:0	for disaster will hit them suddenly.Who knows what punishment will comefrom the Lord and the king ?
20:24:023:0	Here are some further sayings of the wise : It is wrong to show favoritism when passing judgment .
20:24:024:0	A judge who says to the wicked , “ You are innocent , ” will be cursed by many people and denounced by the nations .
20:24:025:0	But it will go well for those who convict the guilty ; rich blessings will be showered on them .
20:24:026:0	An honest answeris like a kiss of friendship .
20:24:027:0	Do your planning and prepare your fieldsbefore building your house .
20:24:028:0	Do n't testify against your neighbors without cause ; do n't lie about them .
20:24:029:0	And do n't say , “ Now I can pay them back for what they 've done to me ! I 'll get even with them ! ”
20:24:030:0	I walked by the field of a lazy person , the vineyard of one with no common sense .
20:24:031:0	I saw that it was overgrown with nettles.It was covered with weeds , and its walls were broken down .
20:24:032:0	Then , as I looked and thought about it , I learned this lesson :
20:24:033:0	A little extra sleep , a little more slumber , a little folding of the hands to rest —
20:24:034:0	then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit ; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber .
