20:4:002:0	for I am giving you good guidance.Do n't turn away from my instructions .
20:4:003:0	For I , too , was once my father 's son , tenderly loved as my mother 's only child .
20:4:004:0	My father taught me , “ Take my words to heart.Follow my commands , and you will live .
20:4:005:0	Get wisdom ; develop good judgment.Do n't forget my words or turn away from them .
20:4:006:0	Do n't turn your back on wisdom , for she will protect you.Love her , and she will guard you .
20:4:007:0	Getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do ! And whatever else you do , develop good judgment .
20:4:008:0	If you prize wisdom , she will make you great.Embrace her , and she will honor you .
20:4:009:0	She will place a lovely wreath on your head ; she will present you with a beautiful crown . ”
20:4:010:0	My child , listen to me and do as I say , and you will have a long , good life .
20:4:011:0	I will teach you wisdom 's waysand lead you in straight paths .
20:4:012:0	When you walk , you wo n't be held back ; when you run , you wo n't stumble .

20:4:014:0	Do n't do as the wicked do , and do n't follow the path of evildoers .
20:4:015:0	Do n't even think about it ; do n't go that way.Turn away and keep moving .
20:4:016:0	For evil people ca n't sleep until they 've done their evil deed for the day.They ca n't rest until they 've caused someone to stumble .
20:4:017:0	They eat the food of wickednessand drink the wine of violence !
20:4:018:0	The way of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn , which shines ever brighter until the full light of day .
