20:5:001:1	Avoid Immoral Women
20:5:001:0	My son , pay attention to my wisdom ; listen carefully to my wise counsel .
20:5:002:0	Then you will show discernment , and your lips will express what you 've learned .
20:5:003:0	For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey , and her mouth is smoother than oil .
20:5:004:0	But in the end she is as bitter as poison , as dangerous as a double-edged sword .
20:5:005:0	Her feet go down to death ; her steps lead straight to the grave .
20:5:006:0	For she cares nothing about the path to life.She staggers down a crooked trail and does n't realize it .
20:5:007:0	So now , my sons , listen to me.Never stray from what I am about to say :
20:5:008:0	Stay away from her ! Do n't go near the door of her house !
20:5:009:0	If you do , you will lose your honorand will lose to merciless people all you have achieved .
20:5:010:0	Strangers will consume your wealth , and someone else will enjoy the fruit of your labor .
20:5:011:0	In the end you will groan in anguishwhen disease consumes your body .
20:5:012:0	You will say , “ How I hated discipline ! If only I had not ignored all the warnings !
20:5:013:0	Oh , why did n't I listen to my teachers ? Why did n't I pay attention to my instructors ?
20:5:014:0	I have come to the brink of utter ruin , and now I must face public disgrace . ”
20:5:015:0	Drink water from your own well—share your love only with your wife .
20:5:016:0	Why spill the water of your springs in the streets , having sex with just anyone ?
20:5:017:0	You should reserve it for yourselves.Never share it with strangers .
20:5:018:0	Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you.Rejoice in the wife of your youth .
20:5:019:0	She is a loving deer , a graceful doe.Let her breasts satisfy you always.May you always be captivated by her love .
20:5:020:0	Why be captivated , my son , by an immoral woman , or fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman ?
20:5:021:0	For the Lord sees clearly what a man does , examining every path he takes .
20:5:022:0	An evil man is held captive by his own sins ; they are ropes that catch and hold him .
20:5:023:0	He will die for lack of self-control ; he will be lost because of his great foolishness .
