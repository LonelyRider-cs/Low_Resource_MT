20:7:001:1	Another Warning about Immoral Women
20:7:001:0	Follow my advice , my son ; always treasure my commands .
20:7:002:0	Obey my commands and live ! Guard my instructions as you guard your own eyes .
20:7:003:0	Tie them on your fingers as a reminder.Write them deep within your heart .
20:7:004:0	Love wisdom like a sister ; make insight a beloved member of your family .
20:7:005:0	Let them protect you from an affair with an immoral woman , from listening to the flattery of a promiscuous woman .
20:7:006:0	While I was at the window of my house , looking through the curtain ,
20:7:007:0	I saw some naive young men , and one in particular who lacked common sense .
20:7:008:0	He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman , strolling down the path by her house .
20:7:009:0	It was at twilight , in the evening , as deep darkness fell .
20:7:010:0	The woman approached him , seductively dressed and sly of heart .
20:7:011:0	She was the brash , rebellious type , never content to stay at home .
20:7:012:0	She is often in the streets and markets , soliciting at every corner .
20:7:013:0	She threw her arms around him and kissed him , and with a brazen look she said ,
20:7:014:0	“ I 've just made my peace offeringsand fulfilled my vows .
20:7:015:0	You 're the one I was looking for ! I came out to find you , and here you are !
20:7:016:0	My bed is spread with beautiful blankets , with colored sheets of Egyptian linen .
20:7:017:0	I 've perfumed my bedwith myrrh , aloes , and cinnamon .
20:7:018:0	Come , let 's drink our fill of love until morning.Let 's enjoy each other 's caresses ,
20:7:019:0	for my husband is not home.He 's away on a long trip .
20:7:020:0	He has taken a wallet full of money with himand wo n't return until later this month . ”
20:7:021:0	So she seduced him with her pretty speechand enticed him with her flattery .
20:7:022:0	He followed her at once , like an ox going to the slaughter.He was like a stag caught in a trap ,
20:7:023:0	awaiting the arrow that would pierce its heart.He was like a bird flying into a snare , little knowing it would cost him his life .
20:7:024:0	So listen to me , my sons , and pay attention to my words .
20:7:025:0	Do n't let your hearts stray away toward her.Do n't wander down her wayward path .
20:7:026:0	For she has been the ruin of many ; many men have been her victims .
20:7:027:0	Her house is the road to the grave.Her bedroom is the den of death .
