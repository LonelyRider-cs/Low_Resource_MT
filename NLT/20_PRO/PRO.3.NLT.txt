20:3:002:1	Lord
20:3:001:0	My child , never forget the things I have taught you.Store my commands in your heart .
20:3:002:0	If you do this , you will live many years , and your life will be satisfying .
20:3:003:0	Never let loyalty and kindness leave you ! Tie them around your neck as a reminder.Write them deep within your heart .
20:3:004:0	Then you will find favor with both God and people , and you will earn a good reputation .
20:3:005:0	Trust in the Lord with all your heart ; do not depend on your own understanding .
20:3:006:0	Seek his will in all you do , and he will show you which path to take .
20:3:007:0	Do n't be impressed with your own wisdom.Instead , fear the Lord and turn away from evil .
20:3:008:0	Then you will have healing for your bodyand strength for your bones .
20:3:009:0	Honor the Lord with your wealthand with the best part of everything you produce .
20:3:010:0	Then he will fill your barns with grain , and your vats will overflow with good wine .
20:3:011:0	My child , do n't reject the Lord 's discipline , and do n't be upset when he corrects you .
20:3:012:0	For the Lord corrects those he loves , just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights .
20:3:013:0	Joyful is the person who finds wisdom , the one who gains understanding .
20:3:014:0	For wisdom is more profitable than silver , and her wages are better than gold .
20:3:015:0	Wisdom is more precious than rubies ; nothing you desire can compare with her .
20:3:016:0	She offers you long life in her right hand , and riches and honor in her left .
20:3:017:0	She will guide you down delightful paths ; all her ways are satisfying .
20:3:018:0	Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her ; happy are those who hold her tightly .
20:3:019:0	By wisdom the Lord founded the earth ; by understanding he created the heavens .
20:3:020:0	By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth , and the dew settles beneath the night sky .
20:3:021:0	My child , do n't lose sight of common sense and discernment.Hang on to them ,
20:3:022:0	for they will refresh your soul.They are like jewels on a necklace .
20:3:023:0	They keep you safe on your way , and your feet will not stumble .
20:3:024:0	You can go to bed without fear ; you will lie down and sleep soundly .
20:3:025:0	You need not be afraid of sudden disasteror the destruction that comes upon the wicked ,
20:3:026:0	for the Lord is your security.He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap .
20:3:027:0	Do not withhold good from those who deserve itwhen it 's in your power to help them .
20:3:028:0	If you can help your neighbor now , do n't say , “ Come back tomorrow , and then I 'll help you . ”
20:3:029:0	Do n't plot harm against your neighbor , for those who live nearby trust you .
20:3:030:0	Do n't pick a fight without reason , when no one has done you harm .
20:3:031:0	Do n't envy violent peopleor copy their ways .
20:3:032:0	Such wicked people are detestable to the Lord , but he offers his friendship to the godly .
20:3:033:0	The Lord curses the house of the wicked , but he blesses the home of the upright .
20:3:034:0	The Lord mocks the mockersbut is gracious to the humble .
20:3:035:0	The wise inherit honor , but fools are put to shame !
