5:3:001:1	Victory over Og of Bashan
5:3:001:0	“ Next we turned and headed for the land of Bashan , where King Og and his entire army attacked us at Edrei .
5:3:002:0	But the Lord told me , ‘ Do not be afraid of him , for I have given you victory over Og and his entire army , and I will give you all his land . Treat him just as you treated King Sihon of the Amorites , who ruled in Heshbon . '
5:3:003:0	“ So the Lord our God handed King Og and all his people over to us , and we killed them all . Not a single person survived .
5:3:004:0	We conquered all sixty of his towns—the entire Argob region in his kingdom of Bashan . Not a single town escaped our conquest .
5:3:005:0	These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates . We also took many unwalled villages at the same time .
5:3:006:0	We completely destroyed the kingdom of Bashan , just as we had destroyed King Sihon of Heshbon . We destroyed all the people in every town we conquered—men , women , and children alike .
5:3:007:0	But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the towns .
5:3:008:0	“ So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River—all the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon .
5:3:009:0	( Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians , and the Amorites call it Senir . )
5:3:010:0	We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan , as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei , which were part of Og 's kingdom in Bashan .
5:3:002:1	Land Division East of the Jordan
5:3:011:0	( King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites . His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide . It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah . )
5:3:012:0	“ When we took possession of this land , I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge , plus half of the hill country of Gilead with its towns .
5:3:013:0	Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan—Og 's former kingdom—to the half-tribe of Manasseh . ( This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known as the land of the Rephaites .
5:3:014:0	Jair , a leader from the tribe of Manasseh , conquered the whole Argob region in Bashan , all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites . Jair renamed this region after himself , calling it the Towns of Jair , as it is still known today . )
5:3:015:0	I gave Gilead to the clan of Makir .
5:3:016:0	But I also gave part of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad . The area I gave them extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge in the south to the Jabbok River on the Ammonite frontier .
5:3:017:0	They also received the Jordan Valley , all the way from the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea , with the Jordan River serving as the western boundary . To the east were the slopes of Pisgah .
5:3:018:0	“ At that time I gave this command to the tribes that would live east of the Jordan : ‘ Although the Lord your God has given you this land as your property , all your fighting men must cross the Jordan ahead of your Israelite relatives , armed and ready to assist them .
5:3:019:0	Your wives , children , and numerous livestock , however , may stay behind in the towns I have given you .
5:3:003:1	Moses Forbidden to Enter the Land
5:3:020:0	When the Lord has given security to the rest of the Israelites , as he has to you , and when they occupy the land the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan River , then you may all return here to the land I have given you . '
5:3:021:0	“ At that time I gave Joshua this charge : ‘ You have seen for yourself everything the Lord your God has done to these two kings . He will do the same to all the kingdoms on the west side of the Jordan .
5:3:022:0	Do not be afraid of the nations there , for the Lord your God will fight for you . '
5:3:023:0	“ At that time I pleaded with the Lord and said ,
5:3:024:0	‘ O Sovereign Lord , you have only begun to show your greatness and the strength of your hand to me , your servant . Is there any god in heaven or on earth who can perform such great and mighty deeds as you do ?
5:3:025:0	Please let me cross the Jordan to see the wonderful land on the other side , the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon mountains . '
5:3:026:0	“ But the Lord was angry with me because of you , and he would not listen to me . ‘ That 's enough ! ' he declared . ‘ Speak of it no more .
5:3:027:0	But go up to Pisgah Peak , and look over the land in every direction . Take a good look , but you may not cross the Jordan River .
5:3:028:0	Instead , commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him , for he will lead the people across the Jordan . He will give them all the land you now see before you as their possession . '
5:3:029:0	So we stayed in the valley near Beth-peor .
