5:33:001:1	Moses Blesses the People
5:33:001:0	This is the blessing that Moses , the man of God , gave to the people of Israel before his death :
5:33:002:0	“ The Lord came from Mount Sinaiand dawned upon us from Mount Seir ; he shone forth from Mount Paranand came from Meribah-kadeshwith flaming fire at his right hand .
5:33:003:0	Indeed , he loves his people ; all his holy ones are in his hands.They follow in his stepsand accept his teaching .
5:33:004:0	Moses gave us the Lord 's instruction , the special possession of the people of Israel .
5:33:005:0	The Lord became king in Israel — when the leaders of the people assembled , when the tribes of Israel gathered as one . ”
5:33:006:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Reuben : “ Let the tribe of Reuben live and not die out , though they are few in number . ”
5:33:007:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Judah : “ O Lord , hear the cry of Judahand bring them together as a people.Give them strength to defend their cause ; help them against their enemies ! ”
5:33:008:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Levi : “ O Lord , you have given your Thummim and Urim — the sacred lots — to your faithful servants the Levites.You put them to the test at Massahand struggled with them at the waters of Meribah .
5:33:009:0	The Levites obeyed your wordand guarded your covenant.They were more loyal to youthan to their own parents.They ignored their relativesand did not acknowledge their own children .
5:33:010:0	They teach your regulations to Jacob ; they give your instructions to Israel.They present incense before youand offer whole burnt offerings on the altar .
5:33:011:0	Bless the ministry of the Levites , O Lord , and accept all the work of their hands.Hit their enemies where it hurts the most ; strike down their foes so they never rise again . ”
5:33:012:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Benjamin : “ The people of Benjamin are loved by the Lordand live in safety beside him.He surrounds them continuouslyand preserves them from every harm . ”
5:33:013:0	Moses said this about the tribes of Joseph : “ May their land be blessed by the Lordwith the precious gift of dew from the heavensand water from beneath the earth ;
5:33:014:0	with the rich fruit that grows in the sun , and the rich harvest produced each month ;
5:33:015:0	with the finest crops of the ancient mountains , and the abundance from the everlasting hills ;
5:33:016:0	with the best gifts of the earth and its bounty , and the favor of the one who appeared in the burning bush.May these blessings rest on Joseph 's head , crowning the brow of the prince among his brothers .
5:33:017:0	Joseph has the majesty of a young bull ; he has the horns of a wild ox.He will gore distant nations , even to the ends of the earth.This is my blessing for the multitudes of Ephraimand the thousands of Manasseh . ”
5:33:018:0	Moses said this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar : “ May the people of Zebulun prosper in their travels.May the people of Issachar prosper at home in their tents .
5:33:019:0	They summon the people to the mountainto offer proper sacrifices there.They benefit from the riches of the seaand the hidden treasures in the sand . ”
5:33:020:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Gad : “ Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad 's territory ! Gad is poised there like a lionto tear off an arm or a head .
5:33:021:0	The people of Gad took the best land for themselves ; a leader 's share was assigned to them.When the leaders of the people were assembled , they carried out the Lord 's justiceand obeyed his regulations for Israel . ”
5:33:022:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Dan : “ Dan is a lion 's cub , leaping out from Bashan . ”
5:33:023:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Naphtali : “ O Naphtali , you are rich in favorand full of the Lord 's blessings ; may you possess the west and the south . ”
5:33:024:0	Moses said this about the tribe of Asher : “ May Asher be blessed above other sons ; may he be esteemed by his brothers ; may he bathe his feet in olive oil .
5:33:025:0	May the bolts of your gates be of iron and bronze ; may you be secure all your days . ”
5:33:026:0	“ There is no one like the God of Israel.He rides across the heavens to help you , across the skies in majestic splendor .
5:33:027:0	The eternal God is your refuge , and his everlasting arms are under you.He drives out the enemy before you ; he cries out , ‘ Destroy them ! '
5:33:028:0	So Israel will live in safety , prosperous Jacob in security , in a land of grain and new wine , while the heavens drop down dew .
5:33:029:0	How blessed you are , O Israel ! Who else is like you , a people saved by the Lord ? He is your protecting shieldand your triumphant sword ! Your enemies will cringe before you , and you will stomp on their backs ! ”
