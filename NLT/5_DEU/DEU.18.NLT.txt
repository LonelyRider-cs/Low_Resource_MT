5:18:001:1	Gifts for the Priests and Levites
5:18:001:0	“ Remember that the Levitical priests — that is , the whole of the tribe of Levi — will receive no allotment of land among the other tribes in Israel . Instead , the priests and Levites will eat from the special gifts given to the Lord , for that is their share .
5:18:002:0	They will have no land of their own among the Israelites . The Lord himself is their special possession , just as he promised them .
5:18:003:0	“ These are the parts the priests may claim as their share from the cattle , sheep , and goats that the people bring as offerings : the shoulder , the cheeks , and the stomach .
5:18:004:0	You must also give to the priests the first share of the grain , the new wine , the olive oil , and the wool at shearing time .
5:18:005:0	For the Lord your God chose the tribe of Levi out of all your tribes to minister in the Lord 's name forever .
5:18:006:0	“ Suppose a Levite chooses to move from his town in Israel , wherever he is living , to the place the Lord chooses for worship .
5:18:007:0	He may minister there in the name of the Lord his God , just like all his fellow Levites who are serving the Lord there .
5:18:002:1	A Call to Holy Living
5:18:008:0	He may eat his share of the sacrifices and offerings , even if he also receives support from his family .
5:18:009:0	“ When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you , be very careful not to imitate the detestable customs of the nations living there .
5:18:010:0	For example , never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering . And do not let your people practice fortune-telling , or use sorcery , or interpret omens , or engage in witchcraft ,
5:18:011:0	or cast spells , or function as mediums or psychics , or call forth the spirits of the dead .
5:18:012:0	Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord . It is because the other nations have done these detestable things that the Lord your God will drive them out ahead of you .
5:18:013:0	But you must be blameless before the Lord your God .
5:18:003:1	True and False Prophets
5:18:014:0	The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers , but the Lord your God forbids you to do such things . ”
5:18:015:0	Moses continued , “ The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your fellow Israelites . You must listen to him .
5:18:016:0	For this is what you yourselves requested of the Lord your God when you were assembled at Mount Sinai . You said , ‘ Do n't let us hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore or see this blazing fire , for we will die . '
5:18:017:0	“ Then the Lord said to me , ‘ What they have said is right .
5:18:018:0	I will raise up a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites . I will put my words in his mouth , and he will tell the people everything I command him .
5:18:019:0	I will personally deal with anyone who will not listen to the messages the prophet proclaims on my behalf .
5:18:020:0	But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or who speaks in the name of another god must die . '
5:18:021:0	“ But you may wonder , ‘ How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from the Lord ? '
5:18:022:0	If the prophet speaks in the Lord 's name but his prediction does not happen or come true , you will know that the Lord did not give that message . That prophet has spoken without my authority and need not be feared .
