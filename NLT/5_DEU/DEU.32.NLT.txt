5:32:001:0	“ Listen , O heavens , and I will speak ! Hear , O earth , the words that I say !
5:32:002:0	Let my teaching fall on you like rain ; let my speech settle like dew.Let my words fall like rain on tender grass , like gentle showers on young plants .
5:32:003:0	I will proclaim the name of the Lord ; how glorious is our God !
5:32:004:0	He is the Rock ; his deeds are perfect.Everything he does is just and fair.He is a faithful God who does no wrong ; how just and upright he is !
5:32:005:0	“ But they have acted corruptly toward him ; when they act so perversely , are they really his children ? They are a deceitful and twisted generation .
5:32:006:0	Is this the way you repay the Lord , you foolish and senseless people ? Is n't he your Father who created you ? Has he not made you and established you ?
5:32:007:0	Remember the days of long ago ; think about the generations past.Ask your father , and he will inform you.Inquire of your elders , and they will tell you .
5:32:008:0	When the Most High assigned lands to the nations , when he divided up the human race , he established the boundaries of the peoplesaccording to the number in his heavenly court .
5:32:009:0	“ For the people of Israel belong to the Lord ; Jacob is his special possession .
5:32:010:0	He found them in a desert land , in an empty , howling wasteland.He surrounded them and watched over them ; he guarded them as he would guard his own eyes .
5:32:011:0	Like an eagle that rouses her chicksand hovers over her young , so he spread his wings to take them upand carried them safely on his pinions .
5:32:012:0	The Lord alone guided them ; they followed no foreign gods .
5:32:013:0	He let them ride over the highlandsand feast on the crops of the fields.He nourished them with honey from the rockand olive oil from the stony ground .
5:32:014:0	He fed them yogurt from the herdand milk from the flock , together with the fat of lambs.He gave them choice rams from Bashan , and goats , together with the choicest wheat.You drank the finest wine , made from the juice of grapes .
5:32:015:0	“ But Israel soon became fat and unruly ; the people grew heavy , plump , and stuffed ! Then they abandoned the God who had made them ; they made light of the Rock of their salvation .
5:32:016:0	They stirred up his jealousy by worshiping foreign gods ; they provoked his fury with detestable deeds .
5:32:017:0	They offered sacrifices to demons , which are not God , to gods they had not known before , to new gods only recently arrived , to gods their ancestors had never feared .
5:32:018:0	You neglected the Rock who had fathered you ; you forgot the God who had given you birth .
5:32:019:0	“ The Lord saw this and drew back , provoked to anger by his own sons and daughters .
5:32:020:0	He said , ‘ I will abandon them ; then see what becomes of them.For they are a twisted generation , children without integrity .
5:32:021:0	They have roused my jealousy by worshiping things that are not God ; they have provoked my anger with their useless idols.Now I will rouse their jealousy through people who are not even a people ; I will provoke their anger through the foolish Gentiles .
5:32:022:0	For my anger blazes forth like fireand burns to the depths of the grave.It devours the earth and all its cropsand ignites the foundations of the mountains .
5:32:023:0	I will heap disasters upon themand shoot them down with my arrows .
5:32:024:0	I will weaken them with famine , burning fever , and deadly disease.I will send the fangs of wild beastsand poisonous snakes that glide in the dust .
5:32:025:0	Outside , the sword will bring death , and inside , terror will strikeboth young men and young women , both infants and the aged .
5:32:026:0	I would have annihilated them , wiping out even the memory of them .
5:32:027:0	But I feared the taunt of Israel 's enemy , who might misunderstand and say , “ Our own power has triumphed ! The Lord had nothing to do with this ! ” '
5:32:028:0	“ But Israel is a senseless nation ; the people are foolish , without understanding .
5:32:029:0	Oh , that they were wise and could understand this ! Oh , that they might know their fate !
5:32:030:0	How could one person chase a thousand of them , and two people put ten thousand to flight , unless their Rock had sold them , unless the Lord had given them up ?
5:32:031:0	But the rock of our enemies is not like our Rock , as even they recognize .
5:32:032:0	Their vine grows from the vine of Sodom , from the vineyards of Gomorrah.Their grapes are poison , and their clusters are bitter .
5:32:033:0	Their wine is the venom of serpents , the deadly poison of cobras .
5:32:034:0	“ The Lord says , ‘ Am I not storing up these things , sealing them away in my treasury ?
5:32:035:0	I will take revenge ; I will pay them back.In due time their feet will slip.Their day of disaster will arrive , and their destiny will overtake them . '
5:32:036:0	“ Indeed , the Lord will give justice to his people , and he will change his mind about his servants , when he sees their strength is goneand no one is left , slave or free .
5:32:037:0	Then he will ask , ‘ Where are their gods , the rocks they fled to for refuge ?
5:32:038:0	Where now are those gods , who ate the fat of their sacrificesand drank the wine of their offerings ? Let those gods arise and help you ! Let them provide you with shelter !
5:32:039:0	Look now ; I myself am he ! There is no other god but me ! I am the one who kills and gives life ; I am the one who wounds and heals ; no one can be rescued from my powerful hand !
5:32:040:0	Now I raise my hand to heavenand declare , “ As surely as I live ,
5:32:041:0	when I sharpen my flashing swordand begin to carry out justice , I will take revenge on my enemiesand repay those who reject me .
5:32:042:0	I will make my arrows drunk with blood , and my sword will devour flesh—the blood of the slaughtered and the captives , and the heads of the enemy leaders . ” '
5:32:043:0	“ Rejoice with him , you heavens , and let all of God 's angels worship him.Rejoice with his people , you Gentiles , and let all the angels be strengthened in him.For he will avenge the blood of his children ; he will take revenge against his enemies.He will repay those who hate himand cleanse his people 's land . ”
5:32:044:0	So Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song to the people .
5:32:045:0	When Moses had finished reciting all these words to the people of Israel ,
5:32:046:0	he added : “ Take to heart all the words of warning I have given you today . Pass them on as a command to your children so they will obey every word of these instructions .
5:32:001:1	Moses ' Death Foretold
5:32:047:0	These instructions are not empty words—they are your life ! By obeying them you will enjoy a long life in the land you will occupy when you cross the Jordan River . ”
5:32:048:0	That same day the Lord said to Moses ,
5:32:049:0	“ Go to Moab , to the mountains east of the river , and climb Mount Nebo , which is across from Jericho . Look out across the land of Canaan , the land I am giving to the people of Israel as their own special possession .
5:32:050:0	Then you will die there on the mountain . You will join your ancestors , just as Aaron , your brother , died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors .
5:32:051:0	For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin . You failed to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel there .
5:32:052:0	So you will see the land from a distance , but you may not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel . ”
