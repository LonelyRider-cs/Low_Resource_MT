5:25:001:0	“ Suppose two people take a dispute to court , and the judges declare that one is right and the other is wrong .
5:25:002:0	If the person in the wrong is sentenced to be flogged , the judge must command him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of lashes appropriate to the crime .
5:25:003:0	But never give more than forty lashes ; more than forty lashes would publicly humiliate your neighbor .
5:25:004:0	“ You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain .
5:25:005:0	“ If two brothers are living together on the same property and one of them dies without a son , his widow may not be married to anyone from outside the family . Instead , her husband 's brother should marry her and have intercourse with her to fulfill the duties of a brother-in-law .
5:25:006:0	The first son she bears to him will be considered the son of the dead brother , so that his name will not be forgotten in Israel .
5:25:007:0	“ But if the man refuses to marry his brother 's widow , she must go to the town gate and say to the elders assembled there , ‘ My husband 's brother refuses to preserve his brother 's name in Israel—he refuses to fulfill the duties of a brother-in-law by marrying me . '
5:25:008:0	The elders of the town will then summon him and talk with him . If he still refuses and says , ‘ I do n't want to marry her , '
5:25:009:0	the widow must walk over to him in the presence of the elders , pull his sandal from his foot , and spit in his face . Then she must declare , ‘ This is what happens to a man who refuses to provide his brother with children . '
5:25:010:0	Ever afterward in Israel his family will be referred to as ‘ the family of the man whose sandal was pulled off ' !
5:25:011:0	“ If two Israelite men get into a fight and the wife of one tries to rescue her husband by grabbing the testicles of the other man ,
5:25:012:0	you must cut off her hand . Show her no pity .
5:25:013:0	“ You must use accurate scales when you weigh out merchandise ,
5:25:014:0	and you must use full and honest measures .
5:25:015:0	Yes , always use honest weights and measures , so that you may enjoy a long life in the land the Lord your God is giving you .
5:25:016:0	All who cheat with dishonest weights and measures are detestable to the Lord your God .
5:25:017:0	“ Never forget what the Amalekites did to you as you came from Egypt .
5:25:018:0	They attacked you when you were exhausted and weary , and they struck down those who were straggling behind . They had no fear of God .
5:25:019:0	Therefore , when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies in the land he is giving you as a special possession , you must destroy the Amalekites and erase their memory from under heaven . Never forget this !
