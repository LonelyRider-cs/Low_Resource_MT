5:17:001:0	“ Never sacrifice sick or defective cattle , sheep , or goats to the Lord your God , for he detests such gifts .
5:17:002:0	“ When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you , a man or woman among you might do evil in the sight of the Lord your God and violate the covenant .
5:17:003:0	For instance , they might serve other gods or worship the sun , the moon , or any of the stars—the forces of heaven—which I have strictly forbidden .
5:17:004:0	When you hear about it , investigate the matter thoroughly . If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel ,
5:17:005:0	then the man or woman who has committed such an evil act must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death .
5:17:006:0	But never put a person to death on the testimony of only one witness . There must always be two or three witnesses .
5:17:007:0	The witnesses must throw the first stones , and then all the people may join in . In this way , you will purge the evil from among you .
5:17:008:0	“ Suppose a case arises in a local court that is too hard for you to decide—for instance , whether someone is guilty of murder or only of manslaughter , or a difficult lawsuit , or a case involving different kinds of assault . Take such legal cases to the place the Lord your God will choose ,
5:17:009:0	and present them to the Levitical priests or the judge on duty at that time . They will hear the case and declare the verdict .
5:17:010:0	You must carry out the verdict they announce and the sentence they prescribe at the place the Lord chooses . You must do exactly what they say .
5:17:011:0	After they have interpreted the law and declared their verdict , the sentence they impose must be fully executed ; do not modify it in any way .
5:17:012:0	Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the Lord your God must die . In this way you will purge the evil from Israel .
5:17:001:1	Guidelines for a King
5:17:013:0	Then everyone else will hear about it and be afraid to act so arrogantly .
5:17:014:0	“ You are about to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you . When you take it over and settle there , you may think , ‘ We should select a king to rule over us like the other nations around us . '
5:17:015:0	If this happens , be sure to select as king the man the Lord your God chooses . You must appoint a fellow Israelite ; he may not be a foreigner .
5:17:016:0	“ The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send his people to Egypt to buy horses , for the Lord has told you , ‘ You must never return to Egypt . '
5:17:017:0	The king must not take many wives for himself , because they will turn his heart away from the Lord . And he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself .
5:17:018:0	“ When he sits on the throne as king , he must copy for himself this body of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests .
5:17:019:0	He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives . That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms of these instructions and decrees .
5:17:020:0	This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens . It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way . And it will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel .
