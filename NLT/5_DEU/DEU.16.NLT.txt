5:16:001:1	Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread
5:16:001:0	“ In honor of the Lord your God , celebrate the Passover each year in the early spring , in the month of Abib , for that was the month in which the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night .
5:16:002:0	Your Passover sacrifice may be from either the flock or the herd , and it must be sacrificed to the Lord your God at the designated place of worship—the place he chooses for his name to be honored .
5:16:003:0	Eat it with bread made without yeast . For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast , as when you escaped from Egypt in such a hurry . Eat this bread—the bread of suffering—so that as long as you live you will remember the day you departed from Egypt .
5:16:004:0	Let no yeast be found in any house throughout your land for those seven days . And when you sacrifice the Passover lamb on the evening of the first day , do not let any of the meat remain until the next morning .
5:16:005:0	“ You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of the towns that the Lord your God is giving you .
5:16:006:0	You must offer it only at the designated place of worship—the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored . Sacrifice it there in the evening as the sun goes down on the anniversary of your exodus from Egypt .
5:16:007:0	Roast the lamb and eat it in the place the Lord your God chooses . Then you may go back to your tents the next morning .
5:16:002:1	The Festival of Harvest
5:16:008:0	For the next six days you may not eat any bread made with yeast . On the seventh day proclaim another holy day in honor of the Lord your God , and no work may be done on that day .
5:16:009:0	“ Count off seven weeks from when you first begin to cut the grain at the time of harvest .
5:16:010:0	Then celebrate the Festival of Harvest to honor the Lord your God . Bring him a voluntary offering in proportion to the blessings you have received from him .
5:16:011:0	This is a time to celebrate before the Lord your God at the designated place of worship he will choose for his name to be honored . Celebrate with your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , the Levites from your towns , and the foreigners , orphans , and widows who live among you .
5:16:003:1	The Festival of Shelters
5:16:012:0	Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt , so be careful to obey all these decrees .
5:16:013:0	“ You must observe the Festival of Shelters for seven days at the end of the harvest season , after the grain has been threshed and the grapes have been pressed .
5:16:014:0	This festival will be a happy time of celebrating with your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites , foreigners , orphans , and widows from your towns .
5:16:015:0	For seven days you must celebrate this festival to honor the Lord your God at the place he chooses , for it is he who blesses you with bountiful harvests and gives you success in all your work . This festival will be a time of great joy for all .
5:16:016:0	“ Each year every man in Israel must celebrate these three festivals : the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the Festival of Harvest , and the Festival of Shelters . On each of these occasions , all men must appear before the Lord your God at the place he chooses , but they must not appear before the Lord without a gift for him .
5:16:004:1	Justice for the People
5:16:017:0	All must give as they are able , according to the blessings given to them by the Lord your God .
5:16:018:0	“ Appoint judges and officials for yourselves from each of your tribes in all the towns the Lord your God is giving you . They must judge the people fairly .
5:16:019:0	You must never twist justice or show partiality . Never accept a bribe , for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the decisions of the godly .
5:16:020:0	Let true justice prevail , so you may live and occupy the land that the Lord your God is giving you .
5:16:021:0	“ You must never set up a wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build for the Lord your God .
5:16:022:0	And never set up sacred pillars for worship , for the Lord your God hates them .
