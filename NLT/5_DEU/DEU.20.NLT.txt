5:20:001:1	Regulations concerning War
5:20:001:0	“ When you go out to fight your enemies and you face horses and chariots and an army greater than your own , do not be afraid . The Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , is with you !
5:20:002:0	When you prepare for battle , the priest must come forward to speak to the troops .
5:20:003:0	He will say to them , ‘ Listen to me , all you men of Israel ! Do not be afraid as you go out to fight your enemies today ! Do not lose heart or panic or tremble before them .
5:20:004:0	For the Lord your God is going with you ! He will fight for you against your enemies , and he will give you victory ! '
5:20:005:0	“ Then the officers of the army must address the troops and say , ‘ Has anyone here just built a new house but not yet dedicated it ? If so , you may go home ! You might be killed in the battle , and someone else would dedicate your house .
5:20:006:0	Has anyone here just planted a vineyard but not yet eaten any of its fruit ? If so , you may go home ! You might die in battle , and someone else would eat the first fruit .
5:20:007:0	Has anyone here just become engaged to a woman but not yet married her ? Well , you may go home and get married ! You might die in the battle , and someone else would marry her . '
5:20:008:0	“ Then the officers will also say , ‘ Is anyone here afraid or worried ? If you are , you may go home before you frighten anyone else . '
5:20:009:0	When the officers have finished speaking to their troops , they will appoint the unit commanders .
5:20:010:0	“ As you approach a town to attack it , you must first offer its people terms for peace .
5:20:011:0	If they accept your terms and open the gates to you , then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor .
5:20:012:0	But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight , you must attack the town .
5:20:013:0	When the Lord your God hands the town over to you , use your swords to kill every man in the town .
5:20:014:0	But you may keep for yourselves all the women , children , livestock , and other plunder . You may enjoy the plunder from your enemies that the Lord your God has given you .
5:20:015:0	“ But these instructions apply only to distant towns , not to the towns of the nations in the land you will enter .
5:20:016:0	In those towns that the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession , destroy every living thing .
5:20:017:0	You must completely destroy the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , just as the Lord your God has commanded you .
5:20:018:0	This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate their detestable customs in the worship of their gods , which would cause you to sin deeply against the Lord your God .
5:20:019:0	“ When you are attacking a town and the war drags on , you must not cut down the trees with your axes . You may eat the fruit , but do not cut down the trees . Are the trees your enemies , that you should attack them ?
5:20:020:0	You may only cut down trees that you know are not valuable for food . Use them to make the equipment you need to attack the enemy town until it falls .
