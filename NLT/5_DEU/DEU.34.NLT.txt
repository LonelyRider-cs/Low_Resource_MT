5:34:001:1	The Death of Moses
5:34:001:0	Then Moses went up to Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab and climbed Pisgah Peak , which is across from Jericho . And the Lord showed him the whole land , from Gilead as far as Dan ;
5:34:002:0	all the land of Naphtali ; the land of Ephraim and Manasseh ; all the land of Judah , extending to the Mediterranean Sea ;
5:34:003:0	the Negev ; the Jordan Valley with Jericho—the city of palms—as far as Zoar .
5:34:004:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob when I said , ‘ I will give it to your descendants . ' I have now allowed you to see it with your own eyes , but you will not enter the land . ”
5:34:005:0	So Moses , the servant of the Lord , died there in the land of Moab , just as the Lord had said .
5:34:006:0	The Lord buried him in a valley near Beth-peor in Moab , but to this day no one knows the exact place .
5:34:007:0	Moses was 120 years old when he died , yet his eyesight was clear , and he was as strong as ever .
5:34:008:0	The people of Israel mourned for Moses on the plains of Moab for thirty days , until the customary period of mourning was over .
5:34:009:0	Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom , for Moses had laid his hands on him . So the people of Israel obeyed him , doing just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
5:34:010:0	There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face .
5:34:011:0	The Lord sent him to perform all the miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh , and all his servants , and his entire land .
5:34:012:0	With mighty power , Moses performed terrifying acts in the sight of all Israel .
