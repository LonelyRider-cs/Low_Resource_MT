5:8:001:1	A Call to Remember and Obey
5:8:001:0	“ Be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today . Then you will live and multiply , and you will enter and occupy the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors .
5:8:002:0	Remember how the Lord your God led you through the wilderness for these forty years , humbling you and testing you to prove your character , and to find out whether or not you would obey his commands .
5:8:003:0	Yes , he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna , a food previously unknown to you and your ancestors . He did it to teach you that people do not live by bread alone ; rather , we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord .
5:8:004:0	For all these forty years your clothes did n't wear out , and your feet did n't blister or swell .
5:8:005:0	Think about it : Just as a parent disciplines a child , the Lord your God disciplines you for your own good .
5:8:006:0	“ So obey the commands of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and fearing him .
5:8:007:0	For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land of flowing streams and pools of water , with fountains and springs that gush out in the valleys and hills .
5:8:008:0	It is a land of wheat and barley ; of grapevines , fig trees , and pomegranates ; of olive oil and honey .
5:8:009:0	It is a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking . It is a land where iron is as common as stone , and copper is abundant in the hills .
5:8:010:0	When you have eaten your fill , be sure to praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you .
5:8:011:0	“ But that is the time to be careful ! Beware that in your plenty you do not forget the Lord your God and disobey his commands , regulations , and decrees that I am giving you today .
5:8:012:0	For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes to live in ,
5:8:013:0	and when your flocks and herds have become very large and your silver and gold have multiplied along with everything else , be careful !
5:8:014:0	Do not become proud at that time and forget the Lord your God , who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt .
5:8:015:0	Do not forget that he led you through the great and terrifying wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions , where it was so hot and dry . He gave you water from the rock !
5:8:016:0	He fed you with manna in the wilderness , a food unknown to your ancestors . He did this to humble you and test you for your own good .
5:8:017:0	He did all this so you would never say to yourself , ‘ I have achieved this wealth with my own strength and energy . '
5:8:018:0	Remember the Lord your God . He is the one who gives you power to be successful , in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath .
5:8:019:0	“ But I assure you of this : If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods , worshiping and bowing down to them , you will certainly be destroyed .
5:8:020:0	Just as the Lord has destroyed other nations in your path , you also will be destroyed if you refuse to obey the Lord your God .
