5:30:001:1	A Call to Return to the
5:30:002:1	Lord
5:30:001:0	“ In the future , when you experience all these blessings and curses I have listed for you , and when you are living among the nations to which the Lord your God has exiled you , take to heart all these instructions .
5:30:002:0	If at that time you and your children return to the Lord your God , and if you obey with all your heart and all your soul all the commands I have given you today ,
5:30:003:0	then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes . He will have mercy on you and gather you back from all the nations where he has scattered you .
5:30:004:0	Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth , the Lord your God will gather you from there and bring you back again .
5:30:005:0	The Lord your God will return you to the land that belonged to your ancestors , and you will possess that land again . Then he will make you even more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors !
5:30:006:0	“ The Lord your God will change your heart and the hearts of all your descendants , so that you will love him with all your heart and soul and so you may live !
5:30:007:0	The Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate and persecute you .
5:30:008:0	Then you will again obey the Lord and keep all his commands that I am giving you today .
5:30:009:0	“ The Lord your God will then make you successful in everything you do . He will give you many children and numerous livestock , and he will cause your fields to produce abundant harvests , for the Lord will again delight in being good to you as he was to your ancestors .
5:30:003:1	The Choice of Life or Death
5:30:010:0	The Lord your God will delight in you if you obey his voice and keep the commands and decrees written in this Book of Instruction , and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul .
5:30:011:0	“ This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you , and it is not beyond your reach .
5:30:012:0	It is not kept in heaven , so distant that you must ask , ‘ Who will go up to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and obey ? '
5:30:013:0	It is not kept beyond the sea , so far away that you must ask , ‘ Who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and obey ? '
5:30:014:0	No , the message is very close at hand ; it is on your lips and in your heart so that you can obey it .
5:30:015:0	“ Now listen ! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death , between prosperity and disaster .
5:30:016:0	For I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to keep his commands , decrees , and regulations by walking in his ways . If you do this , you will live and multiply , and the Lord your God will bless you and the land you are about to enter and occupy .
5:30:017:0	“ But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen , and if you are drawn away to serve and worship other gods ,
5:30:018:0	then I warn you now that you will certainly be destroyed . You will not live a long , good life in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy .
5:30:019:0	“ Today I have given you the choice between life and death , between blessings and curses . Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make . Oh , that you would choose life , so that you and your descendants might live !
5:30:020:0	You can make this choice by loving the Lord your God , obeying him , and committing yourself firmly to him . This is the key to your life . And if you love and obey the Lord , you will live long in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . ”
