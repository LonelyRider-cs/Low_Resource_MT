5:24:001:0	“ Suppose a man marries a woman but she does not please him . Having discovered something wrong with her , he writes a document of divorce , hands it to her , and sends her away from his house .
5:24:002:0	When she leaves his house , she is free to marry another man .
5:24:003:0	But if the second husband also turns against her , writes a document of divorce , hands it to her , and sends her away , or if he dies ,
5:24:004:0	the first husband may not marry her again , for she has been defiled . That would be detestable to the Lord . You must not bring guilt upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession .
5:24:005:0	“ A newly married man must not be drafted into the army or be given any other official responsibilities . He must be free to spend one year at home , bringing happiness to the wife he has married .
5:24:006:0	“ It is wrong to take a set of millstones , or even just the upper millstone , as security for a loan , for the owner uses it to make a living .
5:24:007:0	“ If anyone kidnaps a fellow Israelite and treats him as a slave or sells him , the kidnapper must die . In this way , you will purge the evil from among you .
5:24:008:0	“ In all cases involving serious skin diseases , be careful to follow the instructions of the Levitical priests ; obey all the commands I have given them .
5:24:009:0	Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam as you were coming from Egypt .
5:24:010:0	“ If you lend anything to your neighbor , do not enter his house to pick up the item he is giving as security .
5:24:011:0	You must wait outside while he goes in and brings it out to you .
5:24:012:0	If your neighbor is poor and gives you his cloak as security for a loan , do not keep the cloak overnight .
5:24:013:0	Return the cloak to its owner by sunset so he can stay warm through the night and bless you , and the Lord your God will count you as righteous .
5:24:014:0	“ Never take advantage of poor and destitute laborers , whether they are fellow Israelites or foreigners living in your towns .
5:24:015:0	You must pay them their wages each day before sunset because they are poor and are counting on it . If you do n't , they might cry out to the Lord against you , and it would be counted against you as sin .
5:24:016:0	“ Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children , nor children for the sins of their parents . Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes .
5:24:017:0	“ True justice must be given to foreigners living among you and to orphans , and you must never accept a widow 's garment as security for her debt .
5:24:018:0	Always remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God redeemed you from your slavery . That is why I have given you this command .
5:24:019:0	“ When you are harvesting your crops and forget to bring in a bundle of grain from your field , do n't go back to get it . Leave it for the foreigners , orphans , and widows . Then the Lord your God will bless you in all you do .
5:24:020:0	When you beat the olives from your olive trees , do n't go over the boughs twice . Leave the remaining olives for the foreigners , orphans , and widows .
5:24:021:0	When you gather the grapes in your vineyard , do n't glean the vines after they are picked . Leave the remaining grapes for the foreigners , orphans , and widows .
5:24:022:0	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt . That is why I am giving you this command .
