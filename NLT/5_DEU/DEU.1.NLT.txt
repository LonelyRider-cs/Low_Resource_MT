5:1:001:1	Introduction to Moses ' First Address
5:1:001:0	These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel while they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River . They were camped in the Jordan Valley near Suph , between Paran on one side and Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Di-zahab on the other .
5:1:002:0	Normally it takes only eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-barnea , going by way of Mount Seir .
5:1:003:0	But forty years after the Israelites left Egypt , on the first day of the eleventh month , Moses addressed the people of Israel , telling them everything the Lord had commanded him to say .
5:1:004:0	This took place after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites , who ruled in Heshbon , and at Edrei had defeated King Og of Bashan , who ruled in Ashtaroth .
5:1:002:1	The Command to Leave Sinai
5:1:005:0	While the Israelites were in the land of Moab east of the Jordan River , Moses carefully explained the Lord 's instructions as follows .
5:1:006:0	“ When we were at Mount Sinai , the Lord our God said to us , ‘ You have stayed at this mountain long enough .
5:1:007:0	It is time to break camp and move on . Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the neighboring regions—the Jordan Valley , the hill country , the western foothills , the Negev , and the coastal plain . Go to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon , and all the way to the great Euphrates River .
5:1:003:1	Moses Appoints Leaders from Each Tribe
5:1:008:0	Look , I am giving all this land to you ! Go in and occupy it , for it is the land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and to all their descendants . ' ”
5:1:009:0	Moses continued , “ At that time I told you , ‘ You are too great a burden for me to carry all by myself .
5:1:010:0	The Lord your God has increased your population , making you as numerous as the stars !
5:1:011:0	And may the Lord , the God of your ancestors , multiply you a thousand times more and bless you as he promised !
5:1:012:0	But you are such a heavy load to carry ! How can I deal with all your problems and bickering ?
5:1:013:0	Choose some well-respected men from each tribe who are known for their wisdom and understanding , and I will appoint them as your leaders . '
5:1:014:0	“ Then you responded , ‘ Your plan is a good one . '
5:1:015:0	So I took the wise and respected men you had selected from your tribes and appointed them to serve as judges and officials over you . Some were responsible for a thousand people , some for a hundred , some for fifty , and some for ten .
5:1:016:0	“ At that time I instructed the judges , ‘ You must hear the cases of your fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you . Be perfectly fair in your decisions
5:1:017:0	and impartial in your judgments . Hear the cases of those who are poor as well as those who are rich . Do n't be afraid of anyone 's anger , for the decision you make is God 's decision . Bring me any cases that are too difficult for you , and I will handle them . '
5:1:004:1	Scouts Explore the Land
5:1:018:0	“ At that time I gave you instructions about everything you were to do .
5:1:019:0	“ Then , just as the Lord our God commanded us , we left Mount Sinai and traveled through the great and terrifying wilderness , as you yourselves remember , and headed toward the hill country of the Amorites . When we arrived at Kadesh-barnea ,
5:1:020:0	I said to you , ‘ You have now reached the hill country of the Amorites that the Lord our God is giving us .
5:1:021:0	Look ! He has placed the land in front of you . Go and occupy it as the Lord , the God of your ancestors , has promised you . Do n't be afraid ! Do n't be discouraged ! '
5:1:022:0	“ But you all came to me and said , ‘ First , let 's send out scouts to explore the land for us . They will advise us on the best route to take and which towns we should enter . '
5:1:023:0	“ This seemed like a good idea to me , so I chose twelve scouts , one from each of your tribes .
5:1:024:0	They headed for the hill country and came to the valley of Eshcol and explored it .
5:1:005:1	Israel 's Rebellion against the
5:1:006:1	Lord
5:1:025:0	They picked some of its fruit and brought it back to us . And they reported , ‘ The land the Lord our God has given us is indeed a good land . '
5:1:026:0	“ But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God and refused to go in .
5:1:027:0	You complained in your tents and said , ‘ The Lord must hate us . That 's why he has brought us here from Egypt—to hand us over to the Amorites to be slaughtered .
5:1:028:0	Where can we go ? Our brothers have demoralized us with their report . They tell us , “ The people of the land are taller and more powerful than we are , and their towns are large , with walls rising high into the sky ! We even saw giants there—the descendants of Anak ! ” '
5:1:029:0	“ But I said to you , ‘ Do n't be shocked or afraid of them !
5:1:030:0	The Lord your God is going ahead of you . He will fight for you , just as you saw him do in Egypt .
5:1:031:0	And you saw how the Lord your God cared for you all along the way as you traveled through the wilderness , just as a father cares for his child . Now he has brought you to this place . '
5:1:032:0	“ But even after all he did , you refused to trust the Lord your God ,
5:1:033:0	who goes before you looking for the best places to camp , guiding you with a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day .
5:1:034:0	“ When the Lord heard your complaining , he became very angry . So he solemnly swore ,
5:1:035:0	‘ Not one of you from this wicked generation will live to see the good land I swore to give your ancestors ,
5:1:036:0	except Caleb son of Jephunneh . He will see this land because he has followed the Lord completely . I will give to him and his descendants some of the very land he explored during his scouting mission . '
5:1:037:0	“ And the Lord was also angry with me because of you . He said to me , ‘ Moses , not even you will enter the Promised Land !
5:1:038:0	Instead , your assistant , Joshua son of Nun , will lead the people into the land . Encourage him , for he will lead Israel as they take possession of it .
5:1:039:0	I will give the land to your little ones—your innocent children . You were afraid they would be captured , but they will be the ones who occupy it .
5:1:040:0	As for you , turn around now and go on back through the wilderness toward the Red Sea . '
5:1:041:0	“ Then you confessed , ‘ We have sinned against the Lord ! We will go into the land and fight for it , as the Lord our God has commanded us . ' So your men strapped on their weapons , thinking it would be easy to attack the hill country .
5:1:042:0	“ But the Lord told me to tell you , ‘ Do not attack , for I am not with you . If you go ahead on your own , you will be crushed by your enemies . '
5:1:043:0	“ This is what I told you , but you would not listen . Instead , you again rebelled against the Lord 's command and arrogantly went into the hill country to fight .
5:1:044:0	But the Amorites who lived there came out against you like a swarm of bees . They chased and battered you all the way from Seir to Hormah .
5:1:045:0	Then you returned and wept before the Lord , but he refused to listen .
5:1:046:0	So you stayed there at Kadesh for a long time .
