5:12:001:1	The
5:12:002:1	Lord
5:12:003:1	's Chosen Place for Worship
5:12:001:0	“ These are the decrees and regulations you must be careful to obey when you live in the land that the Lord , the God of your ancestors , is giving you . You must obey them as long as you live .
5:12:002:0	“ When you drive out the nations that live there , you must destroy all the places where they worship their gods—high on the mountains , up on the hills , and under every green tree .
5:12:003:0	Break down their altars and smash their sacred pillars . Burn their Asherah poles and cut down their carved idols . Completely erase the names of their gods !
5:12:004:0	“ Do not worship the Lord your God in the way these pagan peoples worship their gods .
5:12:005:0	Rather , you must seek the Lord your God at the place of worship he himself will choose from among all the tribes—the place where his name will be honored .
5:12:006:0	There you will bring your burnt offerings , your sacrifices , your tithes , your sacred offerings , your offerings to fulfill a vow , your voluntary offerings , and your offerings of the firstborn animals of your herds and flocks .
5:12:007:0	There you and your families will feast in the presence of the Lord your God , and you will rejoice in all you have accomplished because the Lord your God has blessed you .
5:12:008:0	“ Your pattern of worship will change . Today all of you are doing as you please ,
5:12:009:0	because you have not yet arrived at the place of rest , the land the Lord your God is giving you as your special possession .
5:12:010:0	But you will soon cross the Jordan River and live in the land the Lord your God is giving you . When he gives you rest from all your enemies and you 're living safely in the land ,
5:12:011:0	you must bring everything I command you—your burnt offerings , your sacrifices , your tithes , your sacred offerings , and your offerings to fulfill a vow—to the designated place of worship , the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored .
5:12:012:0	“ You must celebrate there in the presence of the Lord your God with your sons and daughters and all your servants . And remember to include the Levites who live in your towns , for they will receive no allotment of land among you .
5:12:013:0	Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you like .
5:12:014:0	You may do so only at the place the Lord will choose within one of your tribal territories . There you must offer your burnt offerings and do everything I command you .
5:12:015:0	“ But you may butcher your animals and eat their meat in any town whenever you want . You may freely eat the animals with which the Lord your God blesses you . All of you , whether ceremonially clean or unclean , may eat that meat , just as you now eat gazelle and deer .
5:12:016:0	But you must not consume the blood . You must pour it out on the ground like water .
5:12:017:0	“ But you may not eat your offerings in your hometown—neither the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil , nor the firstborn of your flocks and herds , nor any offering to fulfill a vow , nor your voluntary offerings , nor your sacred offerings .
5:12:018:0	You must eat these in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose . Eat them there with your children , your servants , and the Levites who live in your towns , celebrating in the presence of the Lord your God in all you do .
5:12:019:0	And be very careful never to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land .
5:12:020:0	“ When the Lord your God expands your territory as he has promised , and you have the urge to eat meat , you may freely eat meat whenever you want .
5:12:021:0	It might happen that the designated place of worship—the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honored—is a long way from your home . If so , you may butcher any of the cattle , sheep , or goats the Lord has given you , and you may freely eat the meat in your hometown , as I have commanded you .
5:12:022:0	Anyone , whether ceremonially clean or unclean , may eat that meat , just as you do now with gazelle and deer .
5:12:023:0	But never consume the blood , for the blood is the life , and you must not consume the lifeblood with the meat .
5:12:024:0	Instead , pour out the blood on the ground like water .
5:12:025:0	Do not consume the blood , so that all may go well with you and your children after you , because you will be doing what pleases the Lord .
5:12:026:0	“ Take your sacred gifts and your offerings given to fulfill a vow to the place the Lord chooses .
5:12:027:0	You must offer the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God . The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out on the altar of the Lord your God , but you may eat the meat .
5:12:028:0	Be careful to obey all my commands , so that all will go well with you and your children after you , because you will be doing what is good and pleasing to the Lord your God .
5:12:029:0	“ When the Lord your God goes ahead of you and destroys the nations and you drive them out and live in their land ,
5:12:030:0	do not fall into the trap of following their customs and worshiping their gods . Do not inquire about their gods , saying , ‘ How do these nations worship their gods ? I want to follow their example . '
5:12:031:0	You must not worship the Lord your God the way the other nations worship their gods , for they perform for their gods every detestable act that the Lord hates . They even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to their gods .
5:12:032:0	“ So be careful to obey all the commands I give you . You must not add anything to them or subtract anything from them .
