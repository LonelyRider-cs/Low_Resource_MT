5:27:001:1	The Altar on Mount Ebal
5:27:001:0	Then Moses and the leaders of Israel gave this charge to the people : “ Obey all these commands that I am giving you today .
5:27:002:0	When you cross the Jordan River and enter the land the Lord your God is giving you , set up some large stones and coat them with plaster .
5:27:003:0	Write this whole body of instruction on them when you cross the river to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you—a land flowing with milk and honey , just as the Lord , the God of your ancestors , promised you .
5:27:004:0	When you cross the Jordan , set up these stones at Mount Ebal and coat them with plaster , as I am commanding you today .
5:27:005:0	“ Then build an altar there to the Lord your God , using natural , uncut stones . You must not shape the stones with an iron tool .
5:27:006:0	Build the altar of uncut stones , and use it to offer burnt offerings to the Lord your God .
5:27:007:0	Also sacrifice peace offerings on it , and celebrate by feasting there before the Lord your God .
5:27:008:0	You must clearly write all these instructions on the stones coated with plaster . ”
5:27:009:0	Then Moses and the Levitical priests addressed all Israel as follows : “ O Israel , be quiet and listen ! Today you have become the people of the Lord your God .
5:27:002:1	Curses from Mount Ebal
5:27:010:0	So you must obey the Lord your God by keeping all these commands and decrees that I am giving you today . ”
5:27:011:0	That same day Moses also gave this charge to the people :
5:27:012:0	“ When you cross the Jordan River , the tribes of Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , Joseph , and Benjamin must stand on Mount Gerizim to proclaim a blessing over the people .
5:27:013:0	And the tribes of Reuben , Gad , Asher , Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali must stand on Mount Ebal to proclaim a curse .
5:27:014:0	“ Then the Levites will shout to all the people of Israel :
5:27:015:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who carves or casts an idol and secretly sets it up . These idols , the work of craftsmen , are detestable to the Lord . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:016:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who dishonors father or mother . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:017:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who steals property from a neighbor by moving a boundary marker . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:018:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who leads a blind person astray on the road . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:019:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who denies justice to foreigners , orphans , or widows . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:020:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with one of his father 's wives , for he has violated his father . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:021:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with an animal . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:022:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with his sister , whether she is the daughter of his father or his mother . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:023:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with his mother-in-law . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:024:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who attacks a neighbor in secret . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:025:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who accepts payment to kill an innocent person . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
5:27:026:0	‘ Cursed is anyone who does not affirm and obey the terms of these instructions . 'And all the people will reply , ‘ Amen . '
