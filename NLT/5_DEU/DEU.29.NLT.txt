5:29:001:1	Moses Reviews the Covenant
5:29:001:0	These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites while they were in the land of Moab , in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Mount Sinai .
5:29:002:0	Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them , “ You have seen with your own eyes everything the Lord did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to his whole country —
5:29:003:0	all the great tests of strength , the miraculous signs , and the amazing wonders .
5:29:004:0	But to this day the Lord has not given you minds that understand , nor eyes that see , nor ears that hear !
5:29:005:0	For forty years I led you through the wilderness , yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out .
5:29:006:0	You ate no bread and drank no wine or other alcoholic drink , but he provided for you so you would know that he is the Lord your God .
5:29:007:0	“ When we came here , King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us , but we defeated them .
5:29:008:0	We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh as their grant of land .
5:29:009:0	“ Therefore , obey the terms of this covenant so that you will prosper in everything you do .
5:29:010:0	All of you — tribal leaders , elders , officers , all the men of Israel — are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God .
5:29:011:0	Your little ones and your wives are with you , as well as the foreigners living among you who chop your wood and carry your water .
5:29:012:0	You are standing here today to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God . The Lord is making this covenant , including the curses .
5:29:013:0	By entering into the covenant today , he will establish you as his people and confirm that he is your God , just as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
5:29:014:0	“ But you are not the only ones with whom I am making this covenant with its curses .
5:29:015:0	I am making this covenant both with you who stand here today in the presence of the Lord our God , and also with the future generations who are not standing here today .
5:29:016:0	“ You remember how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the lands of enemy nations as we left .
5:29:017:0	You have seen their detestable practices and their idols made of wood , stone , silver , and gold .
5:29:018:0	I am making this covenant with you so that no one among you — no man , woman , clan , or tribe — will turn away from the Lord our God to worship these gods of other nations , and so that no root among you bears bitter and poisonous fruit .
5:29:019:0	“ Those who hear the warnings of this curse should not congratulate themselves , thinking , ‘ I am safe , even though I am following the desires of my own stubborn heart . ' This would lead to utter ruin !
5:29:020:0	The Lord will never pardon such people . Instead his anger and jealousy will burn against them . All the curses written in this book will come down on them , and the Lord will erase their names from under heaven .
5:29:021:0	The Lord will separate them from all the tribes of Israel , to pour out on them all the curses of the covenant recorded in this Book of Instruction .
5:29:022:0	“ Then the generations to come , both your own descendants and the foreigners who come from distant lands , will see the devastation of the land and the diseases the Lord inflicts on it .
5:29:023:0	They will exclaim , ‘ The whole land is devastated by sulfur and salt . It is a wasteland with nothing planted and nothing growing , not even a blade of grass . It is like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboiim , which the Lord destroyed in his intense anger . '
5:29:024:0	“ And all the surrounding nations will ask , ‘ Why has the Lord done this to this land ? Why was he so angry ? '
5:29:025:0	“ And the answer will be , ‘ This happened because the people of the land abandoned the covenant that the Lord , the God of their ancestors , made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
5:29:026:0	Instead , they turned away to serve and worship gods they had not known before , gods that were not from the Lord .
5:29:027:0	That is why the Lord 's anger has burned against this land , bringing down on it every curse recorded in this book .
5:29:028:0	In great anger and fury the Lord uprooted his people from their land and banished them to another land , where they still live today ! '
5:29:029:0	“ The Lord our God has secrets known to no one . We are not accountable for them , but we and our children are accountable forever for all that he has revealed to us , so that we may obey all the terms of these instructions .
