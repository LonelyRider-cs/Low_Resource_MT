5:13:001:1	A Warning against Idolatry
5:13:001:0	“ Suppose there are prophets among you or those who dream dreams about the future , and they promise you signs or miracles ,
5:13:002:0	and the predicted signs or miracles occur . If they then say , ‘ Come , let us worship other gods'—gods you have not known before—
5:13:003:0	do not listen to them . The Lord your God is testing you to see if you truly love him with all your heart and soul .
5:13:004:0	Serve only the Lord your God and fear him alone . Obey his commands , listen to his voice , and cling to him .
5:13:005:0	The false prophets or visionaries who try to lead you astray must be put to death , for they encourage rebellion against the Lord your God , who redeemed you from slavery and brought you out of the land of Egypt . Since they try to lead you astray from the way the Lord your God commanded you to live , you must put them to death . In this way you will purge the evil from among you .
5:13:006:0	“ Suppose someone secretly entices you—even your brother , your son or daughter , your beloved wife , or your closest friend—and says , ‘ Let us go worship other gods'—gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known .
5:13:007:0	They might suggest that you worship the gods of peoples who live nearby or who come from the ends of the earth .
5:13:008:0	But do not give in or listen . Have no pity , and do not spare or protect them .
5:13:009:0	You must put them to death ! Strike the first blow yourself , and then all the people must join in .
5:13:010:0	Stone the guilty ones to death because they have tried to draw you away from the Lord your God , who rescued you from the land of Egypt , the place of slavery .
5:13:011:0	Then all Israel will hear about it and be afraid , and no one will act so wickedly again .
5:13:012:0	“ When you begin living in the towns the Lord your God is giving you , you may hear
5:13:013:0	that scoundrels among you are leading their fellow citizens astray by saying , ‘ Let us go worship other gods'—gods you have not known before .
5:13:014:0	In such cases , you must examine the facts carefully . If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you ,
5:13:015:0	you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants , as well as all the livestock .
5:13:016:0	Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it . Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the Lord your God . That town must remain a ruin forever ; it may never be rebuilt .
5:13:017:0	Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction . Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you . He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation , just as he swore to your ancestors .
5:13:018:0	“ The Lord your God will be merciful only if you listen to his voice and keep all his commands that I am giving you today , doing what pleases him .
