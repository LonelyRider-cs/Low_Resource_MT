48:4:001:0	Think of it this way . If a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children , those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up , even though they actually own everything their father had .
48:4:002:0	They have to obey their guardians until they reach whatever age their father set .
48:4:003:0	And that 's the way it was with us before Christ came . We were like children ; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles of this world .
48:4:004:0	But when the right time came , God sent his Son , born of a woman , subject to the law .
48:4:005:0	God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law , so that he could adopt us as his very own children .
48:4:006:0	And because we are his children , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , prompting us to call out , “ Abba , Father . ”
48:4:001:1	Paul 's Concern for the Galatians
48:4:007:0	Now you are no longer a slave but God 's own child . And since you are his child , God has made you his heir .
48:4:008:0	Before you Gentiles knew God , you were slaves to so-called gods that do not even exist .
48:4:009:0	So now that you know God ( or should I say , now that God knows you ) , why do you want to go back again and become slaves once more to the weak and useless spiritual principles of this world ?
48:4:010:0	You are trying to earn favor with God by observing certain days or months or seasons or years .
48:4:011:0	I fear for you . Perhaps all my hard work with you was for nothing .
48:4:012:0	Dear brothers and sisters , I plead with you to live as I do in freedom from these things , for I have become like you Gentiles — free from those laws.You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you .
48:4:013:0	Surely you remember that I was sick when I first brought you the Good News .
48:4:014:0	But even though my condition tempted you to reject me , you did not despise me or turn me away . No , you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself .
48:4:015:0	Where is that joyful and grateful spirit you felt then ? I am sure you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if it had been possible .
48:4:016:0	Have I now become your enemy because I am telling you the truth ?
48:4:017:0	Those false teachers are so eager to win your favor , but their intentions are not good . They are trying to shut you off from me so that you will pay attention only to them .
48:4:018:0	If someone is eager to do good things for you , that 's all right ; but let them do it all the time , not just when I 'm with you .
48:4:019:0	Oh , my dear children ! I feel as if I 'm going through labor pains for you again , and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives .
48:4:002:1	Abraham 's Two Children
48:4:020:0	I wish I were with you right now so I could change my tone . But at this distance I do n't know how else to help you .
48:4:021:0	Tell me , you who want to live under the law , do you know what the law actually says ?
48:4:022:0	The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons , one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife .
48:4:023:0	The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God 's promise . But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God 's own fulfillment of his promise .
48:4:024:0	These two women serve as an illustration of God 's two covenants . The first woman , Hagar , represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them .
48:4:025:0	And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia , because she and her children live in slavery to the law .
48:4:026:0	But the other woman , Sarah , represents the heavenly Jerusalem . She is the free woman , and she is our mother .
48:4:027:0	As Isaiah said , “ Rejoice , O childless woman , you who have never given birth ! Break into a joyful shout , you who have never been in labor ! For the desolate woman now has more childrenthan the woman who lives with her husband ! ”
48:4:028:0	And you , dear brothers and sisters , are children of the promise , just like Isaac .
48:4:029:0	But you are now being persecuted by those who want you to keep the law , just as Ishmael , the child born by human effort , persecuted Isaac , the child born by the power of the Spirit .
48:4:030:0	But what do the Scriptures say about that ? “ Get rid of the slave and her son , for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the free woman 's son . ”
48:4:031:0	So , dear brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman ; we are children of the free woman .
