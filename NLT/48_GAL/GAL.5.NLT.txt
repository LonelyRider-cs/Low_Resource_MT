48:5:001:1	Freedom in Christ
48:5:001:0	So Christ has truly set us free . Now make sure that you stay free , and do n't get tied up again in slavery to the law .
48:5:002:0	Listen ! I , Paul , tell you this : If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God , then Christ will be of no benefit to you .
48:5:003:0	I 'll say it again . If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised , you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses .
48:5:004:0	For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law , you have been cut off from Christ ! You have fallen away from God 's grace .
48:5:005:0	But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us .
48:5:006:0	For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus , there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised . What is important is faith expressing itself in love .
48:5:007:0	You were running the race so well . Who has held you back from following the truth ?
48:5:008:0	It certainly is n't God , for he is the one who called you to freedom .
48:5:009:0	This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough !
48:5:010:0	I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings . God will judge that person , whoever he is , who has been confusing you .
48:5:011:0	Dear brothers and sisters , if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised — as some say I do — why am I still being persecuted ? If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ , no one would be offended .
48:5:012:0	I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves .
48:5:013:0	For you have been called to live in freedom , my brothers and sisters . But do n't use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature . Instead , use your freedom to serve one another in love .
48:5:014:0	For the whole law can be summed up in this one command : “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
48:5:002:1	Living by the Spirit 's Power
48:5:015:0	But if you are always biting and devouring one another , watch out ! Beware of destroying one another .
48:5:016:0	So I say , let the Holy Spirit guide your lives . Then you wo n't be doing what your sinful nature craves .
48:5:017:0	The sinful nature wants to do evil , which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants . And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires . These two forces are constantly fighting each other , so you are not free to carry out your good intentions .
48:5:018:0	But when you are directed by the Spirit , you are not under obligation to the law of Moses .
48:5:019:0	When you follow the desires of your sinful nature , the results are very clear : sexual immorality , impurity , lustful pleasures ,
48:5:020:0	idolatry , sorcery , hostility , quarreling , jealousy , outbursts of anger , selfish ambition , dissension , division ,
48:5:021:0	envy , drunkenness , wild parties , and other sins like these . Let me tell you again , as I have before , that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
48:5:022:0	But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives : love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48:5:023:0	gentleness , and self-control . There is no law against these things !
48:5:024:0	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there .
48:5:025:0	Since we are living by the Spirit , let us follow the Spirit 's leading in every part of our lives .
48:5:026:0	Let us not become conceited , or provoke one another , or be jealous of one another .
