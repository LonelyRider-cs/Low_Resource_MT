48:6:001:1	We Harvest What We Plant
48:6:001:0	Dear brothers and sisters , if another believer is overcome by some sin , you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path . And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself .
48:6:002:0	Share each other 's burdens , and in this way obey the law of Christ .
48:6:003:0	If you think you are too important to help someone , you are only fooling yourself . You are not that important .
48:6:004:0	Pay careful attention to your own work , for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done , and you wo n't need to compare yourself to anyone else .
48:6:005:0	For we are each responsible for our own conduct .
48:6:006:0	Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers , sharing all good things with them .
48:6:007:0	Do n't be misled — you can not mock the justice of God . You will always harvest what you plant .
48:6:008:0	Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature . But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit .
48:6:009:0	So let 's not get tired of doing what is good . At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we do n't give up .
48:6:002:1	Paul 's Final Advice
48:6:010:0	Therefore , whenever we have the opportunity , we should do good to everyone — especially to those in the family of faith .
48:6:011:0	Notice what large letters I use as I write these closing words in my own handwriting .
48:6:012:0	Those who are trying to force you to be circumcised want to look good to others . They do n't want to be persecuted for teaching that the cross of Christ alone can save .
48:6:013:0	And even those who advocate circumcision do n't keep the whole law themselves . They only want you to be circumcised so they can boast about it and claim you as their disciples .
48:6:014:0	As for me , may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of that cross , my interest in this world has been crucified , and the world 's interest in me has also died .
48:6:015:0	It does n't matter whether we have been circumcised or not . What counts is whether we have been transformed into a new creation .
48:6:016:0	May God 's peace and mercy be upon all who live by this principle ; they are the new people of God .
48:6:017:0	From now on , do n't let anyone trouble me with these things . For I bear on my body the scars that show I belong to Jesus .
48:6:018:0	Dear brothers and sisters , may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
