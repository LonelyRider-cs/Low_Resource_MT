48:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
48:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , an apostle . I was not appointed by any group of people or any human authority , but by Jesus Christ himself and by God the Father , who raised Jesus from the dead .
48:1:002:0	All the brothers and sisters here join me in sending this letter to the churches of Galatia .
48:1:003:0	May God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
48:1:004:0	Jesus gave his life for our sins , just as God our Father planned , in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live .
48:1:002:1	There Is Only One Good News
48:1:005:0	All glory to God forever and ever ! Amen .
48:1:006:0	I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God , who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ . You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News
48:1:007:0	but is not the Good News at all . You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ .
48:1:008:0	Let God 's curse fall on anyone , including us or even an angel from heaven , who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you .
48:1:009:0	I say again what we have said before : If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed , let that person be cursed .
48:1:003:1	Paul 's Message Comes from Christ
48:1:010:0	Obviously , I 'm not trying to win the approval of people , but of God . If pleasing people were my goal , I would not be Christ 's servant .
48:1:011:0	Dear brothers and sisters , I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human reasoning .
48:1:012:0	I received my message from no human source , and no one taught me . Instead , I received it by direct revelation from Jesus Christ .
48:1:013:0	You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion — how I violently persecuted God 's church . I did my best to destroy it .
48:1:014:0	I was far ahead of my fellow Jews in my zeal for the traditions of my ancestors .
48:1:015:0	But even before I was born , God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace . Then it pleased him
48:1:016:0	to reveal his Son to me so that I would proclaim the Good News about Jesus to the Gentiles.When this happened , I did not rush out to consult with any human being .
48:1:017:0	Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was . Instead , I went away into Arabia , and later I returned to the city of Damascus .
48:1:018:0	Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to get to know Peter , and I stayed with him for fifteen days .
48:1:019:0	The only other apostle I met at that time was James , the Lord 's brother .
48:1:020:0	I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie .
48:1:021:0	After that visit I went north into the provinces of Syria and Cilicia .
48:1:022:0	And still the churches in Christ that are in Judea did n't know me personally .
48:1:023:0	All they knew was that people were saying , “ The one who used to persecute us is now preaching the very faith he tried to destroy ! ”
48:1:024:0	And they praised God because of me .
