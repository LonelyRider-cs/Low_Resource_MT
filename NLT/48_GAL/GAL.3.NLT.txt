48:3:001:1	The Law and Faith in Christ
48:3:001:0	Oh , foolish Galatians ! Who has cast an evil spell on you ? For the meaning of Jesus Christ 's death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross .
48:3:002:0	Let me ask you this one question : Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses ? Of course not ! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ .
48:3:003:0	How foolish can you be ? After starting your new lives in the Spirit , why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort ?
48:3:004:0	Have you experienced so much for nothing ? Surely it was not in vain , was it ?
48:3:005:0	I ask you again , does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law ? Of course not ! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ .
48:3:006:0	In the same way , “ Abraham believed God , and God counted him as righteous because of his faith . ”
48:3:007:0	The real children of Abraham , then , are those who put their faith in God .
48:3:008:0	What 's more , the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would make the Gentiles right in his sight because of their faith . God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said , “ All nations will be blessed through you . ”
48:3:009:0	So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith .
48:3:010:0	But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse , for the Scriptures say , “ Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God 's Book of the Law . ”
48:3:011:0	So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law . For the Scriptures say , “ It is through faith that a righteous person has life . ”
48:3:012:0	This way of faith is very different from the way of law , which says , “ It is through obeying the law that a person has life . ”
48:3:013:0	But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law . When he was hung on the cross , he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing . For it is written in the Scriptures , “ Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree . ”
48:3:002:1	The Law and God 's Promise
48:3:014:0	Through Christ Jesus , God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham , so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith .
48:3:015:0	Dear brothers and sisters , here 's an example from everyday life . Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement , so it is in this case .
48:3:016:0	God gave the promises to Abraham and his child . And notice that the Scripture does n't say “ to his children , ” as if it meant many descendants . Rather , it says “ to his child ” —and that , of course , means Christ .
48:3:017:0	This is what I am trying to say : The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses . God would be breaking his promise .
48:3:018:0	For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law , then it would not be the result of accepting God 's promise . But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise .
48:3:019:0	Why , then , was the law given ? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins . But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised . God gave his law through angels to Moses , who was the mediator between God and the people .
48:3:020:0	Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement . But God , who is one , did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham .
48:3:021:0	Is there a conflict , then , between God 's law and God 's promises ? Absolutely not ! If the law could give us new life , we could be made right with God by obeying it .
48:3:003:1	God 's Children through Faith
48:3:022:0	But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin , so we receive God 's promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ .
48:3:023:0	Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us , we were placed under guard by the law . We were kept in protective custody , so to speak , until the way of faith was revealed .
48:3:024:0	Let me put it another way . The law was our guardian until Christ came ; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith .
48:3:025:0	And now that the way of faith has come , we no longer need the law as our guardian .
48:3:026:0	For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
48:3:027:0	And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ , like putting on new clothes .
48:3:028:0	There is no longer Jew or Gentile , slave or free , male and female . For you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48:3:029:0	And now that you belong to Christ , you are the true children of Abraham . You are his heirs , and God 's promise to Abraham belongs to you .
