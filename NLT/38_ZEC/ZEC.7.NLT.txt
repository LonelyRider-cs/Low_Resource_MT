38:7:001:1	A Call to Justice and Mercy
38:7:001:0	On December 7 of the fourth year of King Darius 's reign , another message came to Zechariah from the Lord .
38:7:002:0	The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech , along with their attendants , to seek the Lord 's favor .
38:7:003:0	They were to ask this question of the prophets and the priests at the Temple of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies : “ Should we continue to mourn and fast each summer on the anniversary of the Temple 's destruction , as we have done for so many years ? ”
38:7:004:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies sent me this message in reply :
38:7:005:0	“ Say to all your people and your priests , ‘ During these seventy years of exile , when you fasted and mourned in the summer and in early autumn , was it really for me that you were fasting ?
38:7:006:0	And even now in your holy festivals , are n't you eating and drinking just to please yourselves ?
38:7:007:0	Is n't this the same message the Lord proclaimed through the prophets in years past when Jerusalem and the towns of Judah were bustling with people , and the Negev and the foothills of Judah were well populated ? ' ”
38:7:008:0	Then this message came to Zechariah from the Lord :
38:7:009:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Judge fairly , and show mercy and kindness to one another .
38:7:010:0	Do not oppress widows , orphans , foreigners , and the poor . And do not scheme against each other .
38:7:011:0	“ Your ancestors refused to listen to this message . They stubbornly turned away and put their fingers in their ears to keep from hearing .
38:7:012:0	They made their hearts as hard as stone , so they could not hear the instructions or the messages that the Lord of Heaven 's Armies had sent them by his Spirit through the earlier prophets . That is why the Lord of Heaven 's Armies was so angry with them .
38:7:013:0	“ Since they refused to listen when I called to them , I would not listen when they called to me , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
38:7:014:0	As with a whirlwind , I scattered them among the distant nations , where they lived as strangers . Their land became so desolate that no one even traveled through it . They turned their pleasant land into a desert . ”
