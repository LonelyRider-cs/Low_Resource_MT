38:10:001:1	The
38:10:002:1	Lord
38:10:003:1	Will Restore His People
38:10:001:0	Ask the Lord for rain in the spring , for he makes the storm clouds.And he will send showers of rainso every field becomes a lush pasture .
38:10:002:0	Household gods give worthless advice , fortune-tellers predict only lies , and interpreters of dreams pronouncefalsehoods that give no comfort.So my people are wandering like lost sheep ; they are attacked because they have no shepherd .
38:10:003:0	“ My anger burns against your shepherds , and I will punish these leaders.For the Lord of Heaven 's Armies has arrivedto look after Judah , his flock.He will make them strong and glorious , like a proud warhorse in battle .
38:10:004:0	From Judah will come the cornerstone , the tent peg , the bow for battle , and all the rulers .
38:10:005:0	They will be like mighty warriors in battle , trampling their enemies in the mud under their feet.Since the Lord is with them as they fight , they will overthrow even the enemy 's horsemen .
38:10:006:0	“ I will strengthen Judah and save Israel ; I will restore them because of my compassion.It will be as though I had never rejected them , for I am the Lord their God , who will hear their cries .
38:10:007:0	The people of Israel will become like mighty warriors , and their hearts will be made happy as if by wine.Their children , too , will see it and be glad ; their hearts will rejoice in the Lord .
38:10:008:0	When I whistle to them , they will come running , for I have redeemed them.From the few who are left , they will grow as numerous as they were before .
38:10:009:0	Though I have scattered them like seeds among the nations , they will still remember me in distant lands.They and their children will surviveand return again to Israel .
38:10:010:0	I will bring them back from Egyptand gather them from Assyria.I will resettle them in Gilead and Lebanonuntil there is no more room for them all .
38:10:011:0	They will pass safely through the sea of distress , for the waves of the sea will be held back , and the waters of the Nile will dry up.The pride of Assyria will be crushed , and the rule of Egypt will end .
38:10:012:0	By my power I will make my people strong , and by my authority they will go wherever they wish.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
