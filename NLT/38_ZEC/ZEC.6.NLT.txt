38:6:001:1	Four Chariots
38:6:001:0	Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains .
38:6:002:0	The first chariot was pulled by red horses , the second by black horses ,
38:6:003:0	the third by white horses , and the fourth by powerful dappled-gray horses .
38:6:004:0	“ And what are these , my lord ? ” I asked the angel who was talking with me .
38:6:005:0	The angel replied , “ These are the four spirits of heaven who stand before the Lord of all the earth . They are going out to do his work .
38:6:006:0	The chariot with black horses is going north , the chariot with white horses is going west , and the chariot with dappled-gray horses is going south . ”
38:6:007:0	The powerful horses were eager to set out to patrol the earth . And the Lord said , “ Go and patrol the earth ! ” So they left at once on their patrol .
38:6:002:1	The Crowning of Jeshua
38:6:008:0	Then the Lord summoned me and said , “ Look , those who went north have vented the anger of my Spirit there in the land of the north . ”
38:6:009:0	Then I received another message from the Lord :
38:6:010:0	“ Heldai , Tobijah , and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon . As soon as they arrive , meet them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah .
38:6:011:0	Accept their gifts , and make a crown from the silver and gold . Then put the crown on the head of Jeshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest .
38:6:012:0	Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Here is the man called the Branch . He will branch out from where he is and build the Temple of the Lord .
38:6:013:0	Yes , he will build the Temple of the Lord . Then he will receive royal honor and will rule as king from his throne . He will also serve as priest from his throne , and there will be perfect harmony between his two roles . '
38:6:014:0	“ The crown will be a memorial in the Temple of the Lord to honor those who gave it — Heldai , Tobijah , Jedaiah , and Josiah son of Zephaniah . ”
38:6:015:0	People will come from distant lands to rebuild the Temple of the Lord . And when this happens , you will know that my messages have been from the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . All this will happen if you carefully obey what the Lord your God says .
