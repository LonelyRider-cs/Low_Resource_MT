38:9:001:1	Judgment against Israel 's Enemies
38:9:001:0	This is the message from the Lord against the land of Aram and the city of Damascus , for the eyes of humanity , including all the tribes of Israel , are on the Lord .
38:9:002:0	Doom is certain for Hamath , near Damascus , and for the cities of Tyre and Sidon , though they are so clever .
38:9:003:0	Tyre has built a strong fortressand has made silver and goldas plentiful as dust in the streets !
38:9:004:0	But now the Lord will strip away Tyre 's possessionsand hurl its fortifications into the sea , and it will be burned to the ground .
38:9:005:0	The city of Ashkelon will see Tyre falland will be filled with fear.Gaza will shake with terror , as will Ekron , for their hopes will be dashed.Gaza 's king will be killed , and Ashkelon will be deserted .
38:9:006:0	Foreigners will occupy the city of Ashdod.I will destroy the pride of the Philistines .
38:9:007:0	I will grab the bloody meat from their mouthsand snatch the detestable sacrifices from their teeth.Then the surviving Philistines will worship our Godand become like a clan in Judah.The Philistines of Ekron will join my people , as the ancient Jebusites once did .
38:9:002:1	Zion 's Coming King
38:9:008:0	I will guard my Templeand protect it from invading armies.I am watching closely to ensurethat no more foreign oppressors overrun my people 's land .
38:9:009:0	Rejoice , O people of Zion ! Shout in triumph , O people of Jerusalem ! Look , your king is coming to you.He is righteous and victorious , yet he is humble , riding on a donkey â€” riding on a donkey 's colt .
38:9:010:0	I will remove the battle chariots from Israeland the warhorses from Jerusalem.I will destroy all the weapons used in battle , and your king will bring peace to the nations.His realm will stretch from sea to seaand from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth .
38:9:011:0	Because of the covenant I made with you , sealed with blood , I will free your prisonersfrom death in a waterless dungeon .
38:9:012:0	Come back to the place of safety , all you prisoners who still have hope ! I promise this very daythat I will repay two blessings for each of your troubles .
38:9:013:0	Judah is my bow , and Israel is my arrow.Jerusalem is my sword , and like a warrior , I will brandish it against the Greeks .
38:9:014:0	The Lord will appear above his people ; his arrows will fly like lightning ! The Sovereign Lord will sound the ram 's hornand attack like a whirlwind from the southern desert .
38:9:015:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies will protect his people , and they will defeat their enemies by hurling great stones.They will shout in battle as though drunk with wine.They will be filled with blood like a bowl , drenched with blood like the corners of the altar .
38:9:016:0	On that day the Lord their God will rescue his people , just as a shepherd rescues his sheep.They will sparkle in his landlike jewels in a crown .
38:9:017:0	How wonderful and beautiful they will be ! The young men will thrive on abundant grain , and the young women will flourish on new wine .
