38:4:001:1	A Lampstand and Two Olive Trees
38:4:001:0	Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me , as though I had been asleep .
38:4:002:0	“ What do you see now ? ” he asked.I answered , “ I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl of oil on top of it . Around the bowl are seven lamps , each having seven spouts with wicks .
38:4:003:0	And I see two olive trees , one on each side of the bowl . ”
38:4:004:0	Then I asked the angel , “ What are these , my lord ? What do they mean ? ”
38:4:005:0	“ Do n't you know ? ” the angel asked. “ No , my lord , ” I replied .
38:4:006:0	Then he said to me , “ This is what the Lord says to Zerubbabel : It is not by force nor by strength , but by my Spirit , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
38:4:007:0	Nothing , not even a mighty mountain , will stand in Zerubbabel 's way ; it will become a level plain before him ! And when Zerubbabel sets the final stone of the Temple in place , the people will shout : ‘ May God bless it ! May God bless it ! ' ”
38:4:008:0	Then another message came to me from the Lord :
38:4:009:0	“ Zerubbabel is the one who laid the foundation of this Temple , and he will complete it . Then you will know that the Lord of Heaven 's Armies has sent me .
38:4:010:0	Do not despise these small beginnings , for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin , to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel 's hand. ” ( The seven lamps represent the eyes of the Lord that search all around the world . )
38:4:011:0	Then I asked the angel , “ What are these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand ,
38:4:012:0	and what are the two olive branches that pour out golden oil through two gold tubes ? ”
38:4:013:0	“ Do n't you know ? ” he asked. “ No , my lord , ” I replied .
38:4:014:0	Then he said to me , “ They represent the two anointed ones who stand in the court of the Lord of all the earth . ”
