38:2:001:1	Future Prosperity of Jerusalem
38:2:001:0	When I looked again , I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand .
38:2:002:0	“ Where are you going ? ” I asked.He replied , “ I am going to measure Jerusalem , to see how wide and how long it is . ”
38:2:003:0	Then the angel who was with me went to meet a second angel who was coming toward him .
38:2:004:0	The other angel said , “ Hurry , and say to that young man , ‘ Jerusalem will someday be so full of people and livestock that there wo n't be room enough for everyone ! Many will live outside the city walls .
38:2:002:1	The Exiles Are Called Home
38:2:005:0	Then I , myself , will be a protective wall of fire around Jerusalem , says the Lord . And I will be the glory inside the city ! ' ”
38:2:006:0	The Lord says , “ Come away ! Flee from Babylon in the land of the north , for I have scattered you to the four winds .
38:2:007:0	Come away , people of Zion , you who are exiled in Babylon ! ”
38:2:008:0	After a period of glory , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies sent me against the nations who plundered you . For he said , “ Anyone who harms you harms my most precious possession .
38:2:009:0	I will raise my fist to crush them , and their own slaves will plunder them. ” Then you will know that the Lord of Heaven 's Armies has sent me .
38:2:010:0	The Lord says , “ Shout and rejoice , O beautiful Jerusalem , for I am coming to live among you .
38:2:011:0	Many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day , and they , too , will be my people . I will live among you , and you will know that the Lord of Heaven 's Armies sent me to you .
38:2:012:0	The land of Judah will be the Lord 's special possession in the holy land , and he will once again choose Jerusalem to be his own city .
38:2:013:0	Be silent before the Lord , all humanity , for he is springing into action from his holy dwelling . ”
