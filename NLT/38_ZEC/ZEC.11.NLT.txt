38:11:001:0	Open your doors , Lebanon , so that fire may devour your cedar forests .
38:11:002:0	Weep , you cypress trees , for all the ruined cedars ; the most majestic ones have fallen.Weep , you oaks of Bashan , for the thick forests have been cut down .
38:11:001:1	The Good and Evil Shepherds
38:11:003:0	Listen to the wailing of the shepherds , for their rich pastures are destroyed.Hear the young lions roaring , for their thickets in the Jordan Valley are ruined .
38:11:004:0	This is what the Lord my God says : “ Go and care for the flock that is intended for slaughter .
38:11:005:0	The buyers slaughter their sheep without remorse . The sellers say , ‘ Praise the Lord ! Now I 'm rich ! ' Even the shepherds have no compassion for them .
38:11:006:0	Likewise , I will no longer have pity on the people of the land , ” says the Lord . “ I will let them fall into each other 's hands and into the hands of their king . They will turn the land into a wilderness , and I will not rescue them . ”
38:11:007:0	So I cared for the flock intended for slaughter—the flock that was oppressed . Then I took two shepherd 's staffs and named one Favor and the other Union .
38:11:008:0	I got rid of their three evil shepherds in a single month.But I became impatient with these sheep , and they hated me , too .
38:11:009:0	So I told them , “ I wo n't be your shepherd any longer . If you die , you die . If you are killed , you are killed . And let those who remain devour each other ! ”
38:11:010:0	Then I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two , showing that I had revoked the covenant I had made with all the nations .
38:11:011:0	That was the end of my covenant with them . The suffering flock was watching me , and they knew that the Lord was speaking through my actions .
38:11:012:0	And I said to them , “ If you like , give me my wages , whatever I am worth ; but only if you want to. ” So they counted out for my wages thirty pieces of silver .
38:11:013:0	And the Lord said to me , “ Throw it to the potter ” —this magnificent sum at which they valued me ! So I took the thirty coins and threw them to the potter in the Temple of the Lord .
38:11:014:0	Then I took my other staff , Union , and cut it in two , showing that the bond of unity between Judah and Israel was broken .
38:11:015:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Go again and play the part of a worthless shepherd .
38:11:016:0	This illustrates how I will give this nation a shepherd who will not care for those who are dying , nor look after the young , nor heal the injured , nor feed the healthy . Instead , this shepherd will eat the meat of the fattest sheep and tear off their hooves .
38:11:017:0	“ What sorrow awaits this worthless shepherdwho abandons the flock ! The sword will cut his armand pierce his right eye.His arm will become useless , and his right eye completely blind . ”
