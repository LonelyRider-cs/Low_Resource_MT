38:8:001:1	Promised Blessings for Jerusalem
38:8:001:0	Then another message came to me from the Lord of Heaven 's Armies :
38:8:002:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : My love for Mount Zion is passionate and strong ; I am consumed with passion for Jerusalem !
38:8:003:0	“ And now the Lord says : I am returning to Mount Zion , and I will live in Jerusalem . Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City ; the mountain of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies will be called the Holy Mountain .
38:8:004:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Once again old men and women will walk Jerusalem 's streets with their canes and will sit together in the city squares .
38:8:005:0	And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls at play .
38:8:006:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : All this may seem impossible to you now , a small remnant of God 's people . But is it impossible for me ? says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
38:8:007:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : You can be sure that I will rescue my people from the east and from the west .
38:8:008:0	I will bring them home again to live safely in Jerusalem . They will be my people , and I will be faithful and just toward them as their God .
38:8:009:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Be strong and finish the task ! Ever since the laying of the foundation of the Temple of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , you have heard what the prophets have been saying about completing the building .
38:8:010:0	Before the work on the Temple began , there were no jobs and no money to hire people or animals . No traveler was safe from the enemy , for there were enemies on all sides . I had turned everyone against each other .
38:8:011:0	“ But now I will not treat the remnant of my people as I treated them before , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
38:8:012:0	For I am planting seeds of peace and prosperity among you . The grapevines will be heavy with fruit . The earth will produce its crops , and the heavens will release the dew . Once more I will cause the remnant in Judah and Israel to inherit these blessings .
38:8:013:0	Among the other nations , Judah and Israel became symbols of a cursed nation . But no longer ! Now I will rescue you and make you both a symbol and a source of blessing . So do n't be afraid . Be strong , and get on with rebuilding the Temple !
38:8:014:0	“ For this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : I was determined to punish you when your ancestors angered me , and I did not change my mind , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
38:8:015:0	But now I am determined to bless Jerusalem and the people of Judah . So do n't be afraid .
38:8:016:0	But this is what you must do : Tell the truth to each other . Render verdicts in your courts that are just and that lead to peace .
38:8:017:0	Do n't scheme against each other . Stop your love of telling lies that you swear are the truth . I hate all these things , says the Lord . ”
38:8:018:0	Here is another message that came to me from the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
38:8:019:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : The traditional fasts and times of mourning you have kept in early summer , midsummer , autumn , and winter are now ended . They will become festivals of joy and celebration for the people of Judah . So love truth and peace .
38:8:020:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : People from nations and cities around the world will travel to Jerusalem .
38:8:021:0	The people of one city will say to the people of another , ‘ Come with us to Jerusalem to ask the Lord to bless us . Let 's worship the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . I 'm determined to go . '
38:8:022:0	Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord of Heaven 's Armies and to ask for his blessing .
38:8:023:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : In those days ten men from different nations and languages of the world will clutch at the sleeve of one Jew . And they will say , ‘ Please let us walk with you , for we have heard that God is with you . ' ”
