38:12:001:1	Future Deliverance for Jerusalem
38:12:001:0	This message concerning the fate of Israel came from the Lord : “ This message is from the Lord , who stretched out the heavens , laid the foundations of the earth , and formed the human spirit .
38:12:002:0	I will make Jerusalem like an intoxicating drink that makes the nearby nations stagger when they send their armies to besiege Jerusalem and Judah .
38:12:003:0	On that day I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock . All the nations will gather against it to try to move it , but they will only hurt themselves .
38:12:004:0	“ On that day , ” says the Lord , “ I will cause every horse to panic and every rider to lose his nerve . I will watch over the people of Judah , but I will blind all the horses of their enemies .
38:12:005:0	And the clans of Judah will say to themselves , ‘ The people of Jerusalem have found strength in the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , their God . '
38:12:006:0	“ On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a flame that sets a woodpile ablaze or like a burning torch among sheaves of grain . They will burn up all the neighboring nations right and left , while the people living in Jerusalem remain secure .
38:12:007:0	“ The Lord will give victory to the rest of Judah first , before Jerusalem , so that the people of Jerusalem and the royal line of David will not have greater honor than the rest of Judah .
38:12:008:0	On that day the Lord will defend the people of Jerusalem ; the weakest among them will be as mighty as King David ! And the royal descendants will be like God , like the angel of the Lord who goes before them !
38:12:009:0	For on that day I will begin to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
38:12:010:0	“ Then I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on the family of David and on the people of Jerusalem . They will look on me whom they have pierced and mourn for him as for an only son . They will grieve bitterly for him as for a firstborn son who has died .
38:12:011:0	The sorrow and mourning in Jerusalem on that day will be like the great mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo .
38:12:012:0	“ All Israel will mourn , each clan by itself , and with the husbands separate from their wives . The clan of David will mourn alone , as will the clan of Nathan ,
38:12:013:0	the clan of Levi , and the clan of Shimei .
38:12:014:0	Each of the surviving clans from Judah will mourn separately , and with the husbands separate from their wives .
