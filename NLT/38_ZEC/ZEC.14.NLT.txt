38:14:001:1	The
38:14:002:1	Lord
38:14:003:1	Will Rule the Earth
38:14:001:0	Watch , for the day of the Lord is coming when your possessions will be plundered right in front of you !
38:14:002:0	I will gather all the nations to fight against Jerusalem . The city will be taken , the houses looted , and the women raped . Half the population will be taken into captivity , and the rest will be left among the ruins of the city .
38:14:003:0	Then the Lord will go out to fight against those nations , as he has fought in times past .
38:14:004:0	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives , east of Jerusalem . And the Mount of Olives will split apart , making a wide valley running from east to west . Half the mountain will move toward the north and half toward the south .
38:14:005:0	You will flee through this valley , for it will reach across to Azal . Yes , you will flee as you did from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah . Then the Lord my God will come , and all his holy ones with him .
38:14:006:0	On that day the sources of light will no longer shine ,
38:14:007:0	yet there will be continuous day ! Only the Lord knows how this could happen . There will be no normal day and night , for at evening time it will still be light .
38:14:008:0	On that day life-giving waters will flow out from Jerusalem , half toward the Dead Sea and half toward the Mediterranean , flowing continuously in both summer and winter .
38:14:009:0	And the Lord will be king over all the earth . On that day there will be one Lord — his name alone will be worshiped .
38:14:010:0	All the land from Geba , north of Judah , to Rimmon , south of Jerusalem , will become one vast plain . But Jerusalem will be raised up in its original place and will be inhabited all the way from the Benjamin Gate over to the site of the old gate , then to the Corner Gate , and from the Tower of Hananel to the king 's winepresses .
38:14:011:0	And Jerusalem will be filled , safe at last , never again to be cursed and destroyed .
38:14:012:0	And the Lord will send a plague on all the nations that fought against Jerusalem . Their people will become like walking corpses , their flesh rotting away . Their eyes will rot in their sockets , and their tongues will rot in their mouths .
38:14:013:0	On that day they will be terrified , stricken by the Lord with great panic . They will fight their neighbors hand to hand .
38:14:014:0	Judah , too , will be fighting at Jerusalem . The wealth of all the neighboring nations will be captured — great quantities of gold and silver and fine clothing .
38:14:015:0	This same plague will strike the horses , mules , camels , donkeys , and all the other animals in the enemy camps .
38:14:016:0	In the end , the enemies of Jerusalem who survive the plague will go up to Jerusalem each year to worship the King , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters .
38:14:017:0	Any nation in the world that refuses to come to Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , will have no rain .
38:14:018:0	If the people of Egypt refuse to attend the festival , the Lord will punish them with the same plague that he sends on the other nations who refuse to go .
38:14:019:0	Egypt and the other nations will all be punished if they do n't go to celebrate the Festival of Shelters .
38:14:020:0	On that day even the harness bells of the horses will be inscribed with these words : Holy to the Lord . And the cooking pots in the Temple of the Lord will be as sacred as the basins used beside the altar .
38:14:021:0	In fact , every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . All who come to worship will be free to use any of these pots to boil their sacrifices . And on that day there will no longer be traders in the Temple of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
