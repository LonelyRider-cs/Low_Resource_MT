38:5:001:1	A Flying Scroll
38:5:001:0	I looked up again and saw a scroll flying through the air .
38:5:002:0	“ What do you see ? ” the angel asked. “ I see a flying scroll , ” I replied . “ It appears to be about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide . ”
38:5:003:0	Then he said to me , “ This scroll contains the curse that is going out over the entire land . One side of the scroll says that those who steal will be banished from the land ; the other side says that those who swear falsely will be banished from the land .

38:5:004:0	And this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : I am sending this curse into the house of every thief and into the house of everyone who swears falsely using my name . And my curse will remain in that house and completely destroy it — even its timbers and stones . ”
38:5:005:0	Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said , “ Look up and see what 's coming . ”
38:5:006:0	“ What is it ? ” I asked.He replied , “ It is a basket for measuring grain , and it 's filled with the sins of everyone throughout the land . ”
38:5:007:0	Then the heavy lead cover was lifted off the basket , and there was a woman sitting inside it .
38:5:008:0	The angel said , “ The woman 's name is Wickedness , ” and he pushed her back into the basket and closed the heavy lid again .
38:5:009:0	Then I looked up and saw two women flying toward us , gliding on the wind . They had wings like a stork , and they picked up the basket and flew into the sky .
38:5:010:0	“ Where are they taking the basket ? ” I asked the angel .
38:5:011:0	He replied , “ To the land of Babylonia , where they will build a temple for the basket . And when the temple is ready , they will set the basket there on its pedestal . ”
