38:1:001:1	A Call to Return to the
38:1:002:1	Lord
38:1:001:0	In November of the second year of King Darius 's reign , the Lord gave this message to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo :
38:1:002:0	“ I , the Lord , was very angry with your ancestors .
38:1:003:0	Therefore , say to the people , ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Return to me , and I will return to you , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . '
38:1:004:0	Do n't be like your ancestors who would not listen or pay attention when the earlier prophets said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Turn from your evil ways , and stop all your evil practices . '
38:1:005:0	“ Where are your ancestors now ? They and the prophets are long dead .
38:1:003:1	A Man among the Myrtle Trees
38:1:006:0	But everything I said through my servants the prophets happened to your ancestors , just as I said . As a result , they repented and said , ‘ We have received what we deserved from the Lord of Heaven 's Armies . He has done what he said he would do . ' ”
38:1:007:0	Three months later , on February 15 , the Lord sent another message to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo .
38:1:008:0	In a vision during the night , I saw a man sitting on a red horse that was standing among some myrtle trees in a small valley . Behind him were riders on red , brown , and white horses .
38:1:009:0	I asked the angel who was talking with me , “ My lord , what do these horses mean ? ” “ I will show you , ” the angel replied .
38:1:010:0	The rider standing among the myrtle trees then explained , “ They are the ones the Lord has sent out to patrol the earth . ”
38:1:011:0	Then the other riders reported to the angel of the Lord , who was standing among the myrtle trees , “ We have been patrolling the earth , and the whole earth is at peace . ”
38:1:012:0	Upon hearing this , the angel of the Lord prayed this prayer : “ O Lord of Heaven 's Armies , for seventy years now you have been angry with Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . How long until you again show mercy to them ? ”
38:1:013:0	And the Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me .
38:1:014:0	Then the angel said to me , “ Shout this message for all to hear : ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : My love for Jerusalem and Mount Zion is passionate and strong .
38:1:015:0	But I am very angry with the other nations that are now enjoying peace and security . I was only a little angry with my people , but the nations inflicted harm on them far beyond my intentions .
38:1:016:0	“ ‘ Therefore , this is what the Lord says : I have returned to show mercy to Jerusalem . My Temple will be rebuilt , says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , and measurements will be taken for the reconstruction of Jerusalem . '
38:1:004:1	Four Horns and Four Blacksmiths
38:1:017:0	“ Say this also : ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : The towns of Israel will again overflow with prosperity , and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem as his own . ' ”
38:1:018:0	Then I looked up and saw four animal horns .
38:1:019:0	“ What are these ? ” I asked the angel who was talking with me.He replied , “ These horns represent the nations that scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem . ”
38:1:020:0	Then the Lord showed me four blacksmiths .
38:1:021:0	“ What are these men coming to do ? ” I asked.The angel replied , “ These four horns — these nations — scattered and humbled Judah . Now these blacksmiths have come to terrify those nations and throw them down and destroy them . ”
