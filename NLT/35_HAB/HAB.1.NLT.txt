35:1:001:1	Habakkuk 's Complaint
35:1:001:0	This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision .
35:1:002:0	How long , O Lord , must I call for help ? But you do not listen ! “ Violence is everywhere ! ” I cry , but you do not come to save .
35:1:003:0	Must I forever see these evil deeds ? Why must I watch all this misery ? Wherever I look , I see destruction and violence.I am surrounded by peoplewho love to argue and fight .
35:1:002:1	The
35:1:003:1	Lord
35:1:004:1	's Reply
35:1:004:0	The law has become paralyzed , and there is no justice in the courts.The wicked far outnumber the righteous , so that justice has become perverted .
35:1:005:0	The Lord replied , “ Look around at the nations ; look and be amazed ! For I am doing something in your own day , something you would n't believeeven if someone told you about it .
35:1:006:0	I am raising up the Babylonians , a cruel and violent people.They will march across the worldand conquer other lands .
35:1:007:0	They are notorious for their crueltyand do whatever they like .
35:1:008:0	Their horses are swifter than cheetahsand fiercer than wolves at dusk.Their charioteers charge from far away.Like eagles , they swoop down to devour their prey .
35:1:009:0	“ On they come , all bent on violence.Their hordes advance like a desert wind , sweeping captives ahead of them like sand .
35:1:010:0	They scoff at kings and princesand scorn all their fortresses.They simply pile ramps of earthagainst their walls and capture them !

35:1:011:0	They sweep past like the windand are gone.But they are deeply guilty , for their own strength is their god . ”
35:1:012:0	O Lord my God , my Holy One , you who are eternal—surely you do not plan to wipe us out ? O Lord , our Rock , you have sent these Babylonians to correct us , to punish us for our many sins .
35:1:013:0	But you are pure and can not stand the sight of evil.Will you wink at their treachery ? Should you be silent while the wickedswallow up people more righteous than they ?
35:1:014:0	Are we only fish to be caught and killed ? Are we only sea creatures that have no leader ?
35:1:015:0	Must we be strung up on their hooksand caught in their nets while they rejoice and celebrate ?
35:1:016:0	Then they will worship their netsand burn incense in front of them. “ These nets are the gods who have made us rich ! ” they will claim .
35:1:017:0	Will you let them get away with this forever ? Will they succeed forever in their heartless conquests ?
