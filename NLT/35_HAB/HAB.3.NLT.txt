35:3:001:1	Habakkuk 's Prayer
35:3:001:0	This prayer was sung by the prophet Habakkuk :
35:3:002:0	I have heard all about you , Lord.I am filled with awe by your amazing works.In this time of our deep need , help us again as you did in years gone by.And in your anger , remember your mercy .
35:3:003:0	I see God moving across the deserts from Edom , the Holy One coming from Mount Paran.His brilliant splendor fills the heavens , and the earth is filled with his praise .
35:3:004:0	His coming is as brilliant as the sunrise.Rays of light flash from his hands , where his awesome power is hidden .
35:3:005:0	Pestilence marches before him ; plague follows close behind .
35:3:006:0	When he stops , the earth shakes.When he looks , the nations tremble.He shatters the everlasting mountainsand levels the eternal hills.He is the Eternal One !
35:3:007:0	I see the people of Cushan in distress , and the nation of Midian trembling in terror .
35:3:008:0	Was it in anger , Lord , that you struck the riversand parted the sea ? Were you displeased with them ? No , you were sending your chariots of salvation !
35:3:009:0	You brandished your bowand your quiver of arrows.You split open the earth with flowing rivers .
35:3:010:0	The mountains watched and trembled.Onward swept the raging waters.The mighty deep cried out , lifting its hands in submission .
35:3:011:0	The sun and moon stood still in the skyas your brilliant arrows flewand your glittering spear flashed .
35:3:012:0	You marched across the land in angerand trampled the nations in your fury .
35:3:013:0	You went out to rescue your chosen people , to save your anointed ones.You crushed the heads of the wickedand stripped their bones from head to toe .
35:3:014:0	With his own weapons , you destroyed the chief of thosewho rushed out like a whirlwind , thinking Israel would be easy prey .
35:3:015:0	You trampled the sea with your horses , and the mighty waters piled high .
35:3:016:0	I trembled inside when I heard this ; my lips quivered with fear.My legs gave way beneath me , and I shook in terror.I will wait quietly for the coming daywhen disaster will strike the people who invade us .
35:3:017:0	Even though the fig trees have no blossoms , and there are no grapes on the vines ; even though the olive crop fails , and the fields lie empty and barren ; even though the flocks die in the fields , and the cattle barns are empty ,
35:3:018:0	yet I will rejoice in the Lord ! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation !
35:3:019:0	The Sovereign Lord is my strength ! He makes me as surefooted as a deer , able to tread upon the heights . ( For the choir director : This prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments . )
