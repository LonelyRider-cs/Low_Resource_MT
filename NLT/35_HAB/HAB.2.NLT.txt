35:2:003:1	's Second Reply
35:2:001:0	I will climb up to my watchtowerand stand at my guardpost.There I will wait to see what the Lord saysand how he will answer my complaint .
35:2:002:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Write my answer plainly on tablets , so that a runner can carry the correct message to others .
35:2:003:0	This vision is for a future time.It describes the end , and it will be fulfilled.If it seems slow in coming , wait patiently , for it will surely take place.It will not be delayed .
35:2:004:0	“ Look at the proud ! They trust in themselves , and their lives are crooked.But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God .
35:2:005:0	Wealth is treacherous , and the arrogant are never at rest.They open their mouths as wide as the grave , and like death , they are never satisfied.In their greed they have gathered up many nationsand swallowed many peoples .
35:2:006:0	“ But soon their captives will taunt them.They will mock them , saying , ‘ What sorrow awaits you thieves ! Now you will get what you deserve ! You 've become rich by extortion , but how much longer can this go on ? '
35:2:007:0	Suddenly , your debtors will take action.They will turn on you and take all you have , while you stand trembling and helpless .
35:2:008:0	Because you have plundered many nations , now all the survivors will plunder you.You committed murder throughout the countrysideand filled the towns with violence .
35:2:009:0	“ What sorrow awaits you who build big houseswith money gained dishonestly ! You believe your wealth will buy security , putting your family 's nest beyond the reach of danger .
35:2:010:0	But by the murders you committed , you have shamed your name and forfeited your lives .
35:2:011:0	The very stones in the walls cry out against you , and the beams in the ceilings echo the complaint .
35:2:012:0	“ What sorrow awaits you who build citieswith money gained through murder and corruption !
35:2:013:0	Has not the Lord of Heaven 's Armies promisedthat the wealth of nations will turn to ashes ? They work so hard , but all in vain !
35:2:014:0	For as the waters fill the sea , the earth will be filled with an awarenessof the glory of the Lord .
35:2:015:0	“ What sorrow awaits you who make your neighbors drunk ! You force your cup on themso you can gloat over their shameful nakedness .
35:2:016:0	But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced.Come , drink and be exposed ! Drink from the cup of the Lord 's judgment , and all your glory will be turned to shame .
35:2:017:0	You cut down the forests of Lebanon.Now you will be cut down.You destroyed the wild animals , so now their terror will be yours.You committed murder throughout the countrysideand filled the towns with violence .
35:2:018:0	“ What good is an idol carved by man , or a cast image that deceives you ? How foolish to trust in your own creation — a god that ca n't even talk !
35:2:019:0	What sorrow awaits you who say to wooden idols , ‘ Wake up and save us ! 'To speechless stone images you say , ‘ Rise up and teach us ! 'Can an idol tell you what to do ? They may be overlaid with gold and silver , but they are lifeless inside .
35:2:020:0	But the Lord is in his holy Temple.Let all the earth be silent before him . ”
