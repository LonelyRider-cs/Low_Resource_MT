53:1:002:0	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
53:1:003:0	Dear brothers and sisters , we ca n't help but thank God for you , because your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing .
53:1:004:0	We proudly tell God 's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering .
53:1:005:0	And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom , for which you are suffering .
53:1:006:0	In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you .
53:1:007:0	And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven . He will come with his mighty angels ,
53:1:008:0	in flaming fire , bringing judgment on those who do n't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus .
53:1:009:0	They will be punished with eternal destruction , forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power .
53:1:010:0	When he comes on that day , he will receive glory from his holy peopleâ€”praise from all who believe . And this includes you , for you believed what we told you about him .
53:1:011:0	So we keep on praying for you , asking our God to enable you to live a life worthy of his call . May he give you the power to accomplish all the good things your faith prompts you to do .
53:1:012:0	Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored because of the way you live , and you will be honored along with him . This is all made possible because of the grace of our God and Lord , Jesus Christ .
