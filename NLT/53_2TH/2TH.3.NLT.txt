53:3:001:1	Paul 's Request for Prayer
53:3:001:0	Finally , dear brothers and sisters , we ask you to pray for us . Pray that the Lord 's message will spread rapidly and be honored wherever it goes , just as when it came to you .
53:3:002:0	Pray , too , that we will be rescued from wicked and evil people , for not everyone is a believer .
53:3:003:0	But the Lord is faithful ; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one .
53:3:004:0	And we are confident in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we commanded you .
53:3:002:1	An Exhortation to Proper Living
53:3:005:0	May the Lord lead your hearts into a full understanding and expression of the love of God and the patient endurance that comes from Christ .
53:3:006:0	And now , dear brothers and sisters , we give you this command in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ : Stay away from all believers who live idle lives and do n't follow the tradition they received from us .
53:3:007:0	For you know that you ought to imitate us . We were not idle when we were with you .
53:3:008:0	We never accepted food from anyone without paying for it . We worked hard day and night so we would not be a burden to any of you .
53:3:009:0	We certainly had the right to ask you to feed us , but we wanted to give you an example to follow .
53:3:010:0	Even while we were with you , we gave you this command : “ Those unwilling to work will not get to eat . ”
53:3:011:0	Yet we hear that some of you are living idle lives , refusing to work and meddling in other people 's business .
53:3:012:0	We command such people and urge them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work to earn their own living .
53:3:013:0	As for the rest of you , dear brothers and sisters , never get tired of doing good .
53:3:014:0	Take note of those who refuse to obey what we say in this letter . Stay away from them so they will be ashamed .
53:3:003:1	Paul 's Final Greetings
53:3:015:0	Do n't think of them as enemies , but warn them as you would a brother or sister .
53:3:016:0	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you his peace at all times and in every situation . The Lord be with you all .
53:3:017:0	Here is my greeting in my own handwriting — Paul . I do this in all my letters to prove they are from me .
53:3:018:0	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
