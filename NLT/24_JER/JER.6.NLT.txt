24:6:001:1	Jerusalem 's Last Warning
24:6:001:0	“ Run for your lives , you people of Benjamin ! Get out of Jerusalem ! Sound the alarm in Tekoa ! Send up a signal at Beth-hakkerem ! A powerful army is coming from the north , coming with disaster and destruction .
24:6:002:0	O Jerusalem , you are my beautiful and delicate daughter — but I will destroy you !
24:6:003:0	Enemies will surround you , like shepherds camped around the city.Each chooses a place for his troops to devour .
24:6:004:0	They shout , ‘ Prepare for battle ! Attack at noon ! ' ‘ No , it 's too late ; the day is fading , and the evening shadows are falling . '
24:6:005:0	‘ Well then , let 's attack at nightand destroy her palaces ! ' ”
24:6:006:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ Cut down the trees for battering rams.Build siege ramps against the walls of Jerusalem.This is the city to be punished , for she is wicked through and through .
24:6:007:0	She spouts evil like a fountain.Her streets echo with the sounds of violence and destruction.I always see her sickness and sores .
24:6:008:0	Listen to this warning , Jerusalem , or I will turn from you in disgust.Listen , or I will turn you into a heap of ruins , a land where no one lives . ”
24:6:002:1	Judah 's Constant Rebellion
24:6:009:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ Even the few who remain in Israelwill be picked over again , as when a harvester checks each vine a second timeto pick the grapes that were missed . ”
24:6:010:0	To whom can I give warning ? Who will listen when I speak ? Their ears are closed , and they can not hear.They scorn the word of the Lord.They do n't want to listen at all .
24:6:011:0	So now I am filled with the Lord 's fury.Yes , I am tired of holding it in ! “ I will pour out my fury on children playing in the streetsand on gatherings of young men , on husbands and wivesand on those who are old and gray .
24:6:012:0	Their homes will be turned over to their enemies , as will their fields and their wives.For I will raise my powerful fistagainst the people of this land , ” says the Lord .
24:6:013:0	“ From the least to the greatest , their lives are ruled by greed.From prophets to priests , they are all frauds .
24:6:014:0	They offer superficial treatmentsfor my people 's mortal wound.They give assurances of peacewhen there is no peace .
24:6:003:1	Judah Rejects the
24:6:004:1	Lord
24:6:005:1	's Way
24:6:015:0	Are they ashamed of their disgusting actions ? Not at all — they do n't even know how to blush ! Therefore , they will lie among the slaughtered.They will be brought down when I punish them , ” says the Lord .
24:6:016:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Stop at the crossroads and look around.Ask for the old , godly way , and walk in it.Travel its path , and you will find rest for your souls.But you reply , ‘ No , that 's not the road we want ! '
24:6:017:0	I posted watchmen over you who said , ‘ Listen for the sound of the alarm . 'But you replied , ‘ No ! We wo n't pay attention ! '
24:6:018:0	“ Therefore , listen to this , all you nations.Take note of my people 's situation .
24:6:019:0	Listen , all the earth ! I will bring disaster on my people.It is the fruit of their own schemes , because they refuse to listen to me.They have rejected my word .
24:6:020:0	There 's no use offering me sweet frankincense from Sheba.Keep your fragrant calamus imported from distant lands ! I will not accept your burnt offerings.Your sacrifices have no pleasing aroma for me . ”
24:6:006:1	An Invasion from the North
24:6:021:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord says : “ I will put obstacles in my people 's path.Fathers and sons will both fall over them.Neighbors and friends will die together . ”
24:6:022:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Look ! A great army coming from the north ! A great nation is rising against you from far-off lands .
24:6:023:0	They are armed with bows and spears.They are cruel and show no mercy.They sound like a roaring seaas they ride forward on horses.They are coming in battle formation , planning to destroy you , beautiful Jerusalem . ”
24:6:024:0	We have heard reports about the enemy , and we wring our hands in fright.Pangs of anguish have gripped us , like those of a woman in labor .
24:6:025:0	Do n't go out to the fields ! Do n't travel on the roads ! The enemy 's sword is everywhereand terrorizes us at every turn !
24:6:026:0	Oh , my people , dress yourselves in burlapand sit among the ashes.Mourn and weep bitterly , as for the loss of an only son.For suddenly the destroying armies will be upon you !
24:6:027:0	“ Jeremiah , I have made you a tester of metals , that you may determine the quality of my people .
24:6:028:0	They are the worst kind of rebel , full of slander.They are as hard as bronze and iron , and they lead others into corruption .
24:6:029:0	The bellows fiercely fan the flamesto burn out the corruption.But it does not purify them , for the wickedness remains .
24:6:030:0	I will label them ‘ Rejected Silver , 'for I , the Lord , am discarding them . ”
