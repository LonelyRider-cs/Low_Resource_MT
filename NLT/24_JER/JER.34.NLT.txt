24:34:001:1	A Warning for Zedekiah
24:34:001:0	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all the armies from the kingdoms he ruled , and he fought against Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . At that time this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
24:34:002:0	“ Go to King Zedekiah of Judah , and tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon , and he will burn it down .
24:34:003:0	You will not escape his grasp but will be captured and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face . Then you will be exiled to Babylon .
24:34:004:0	“ ‘ But listen to this promise from the Lord , O Zedekiah , king of Judah . This is what the Lord says : You will not be killed in war
24:34:005:0	but will die peacefully . People will burn incense in your memory , just as they did for your ancestors , the kings who preceded you . They will mourn for you , crying , “ Alas , our master is dead ! ” This I have decreed , says the Lord . ' ”
24:34:006:0	So Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah .
24:34:002:1	Freedom for Hebrew Slaves
24:34:007:0	At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem , Lachish , and Azekah — the only fortified cities of Judah not yet captured .
24:34:008:0	This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah made a covenant with the people , proclaiming freedom for the slaves .
24:34:009:0	He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves — both men and women . No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage .
24:34:010:0	The officials and all the people had obeyed the king 's command ,
24:34:011:0	but later they changed their minds . They took back the men and women they had freed , forcing them to be slaves again .
24:34:012:0	So the Lord gave them this message through Jeremiah :
24:34:013:0	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I made a covenant with your ancestors long ago when I rescued them from their slavery in Egypt .
24:34:014:0	I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years . But your ancestors paid no attention to me .
24:34:015:0	Recently you repented and did what was right , following my command . You freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in the Temple that bears my name .
24:34:016:0	But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking back the men and women you had freed , forcing them to be slaves once again .
24:34:017:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Lord says : Since you have not obeyed me by setting your countrymen free , I will set you free to be destroyed by war , disease , and famine . You will be an object of horror to all the nations of the earth .
24:34:018:0	Because you have broken the terms of our covenant , I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows .
24:34:019:0	Yes , I will cut you apart , whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem , court officials , priests , or common people — for you have broken your oath .
24:34:020:0	I will give you to your enemies , and they will kill you . Your bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals .
24:34:021:0	“ I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon . And although they have left Jerusalem for a while ,
24:34:022:0	I will call the Babylonian armies back again . They will fight against this city and will capture it and burn it down . I will see to it that all the towns of Judah are destroyed , with no one living there . ”
