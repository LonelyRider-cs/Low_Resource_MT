24:21:001:1	No Deliverance from Babylon
24:21:001:0	The Lord spoke through Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malkijah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah , the priest , to speak with him . They begged Jeremiah ,
24:21:002:0	“ Please speak to the Lord for us and ask him to help us . King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is attacking Judah . Perhaps the Lord will be gracious and do a mighty miracle as he has done in the past . Perhaps he will force Nebuchadnezzar to withdraw his armies . ”
24:21:003:0	Jeremiah replied , “ Go back to King Zedekiah and tell him ,
24:21:004:0	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I will make your weapons useless against the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside your walls attacking you . In fact , I will bring your enemies right into the heart of this city .
24:21:005:0	I myself will fight against you with a strong hand and a powerful arm , for I am very angry . You have made me furious !
24:21:006:0	I will send a terrible plague upon this city , and both people and animals will die .
24:21:007:0	And after all that , says the Lord , I will hand over King Zedekiah , his staff , and everyone else in the city who survives the disease , war , and famine . I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their other enemies . He will slaughter them and show them no mercy , pity , or compassion . '
24:21:008:0	“ Tell all the people , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Take your choice of life or death !
24:21:009:0	Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war , famine , or disease , but those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will live . Their reward will be life !
24:21:002:1	Judgment on Judah 's Kings
24:21:010:0	For I have decided to bring disaster and not good upon this city , says the Lord . It will be handed over to the king of Babylon , and he will reduce it to ashes . '
24:21:011:0	“ Say to the royal family of Judah , ‘ Listen to this message from the Lord !
24:21:012:0	This is what the Lord says to the dynasty of David : “ ‘ Give justice each morning to the people you judge ! Help those who have been robbed ; rescue them from their oppressors.Otherwise , my anger will burn like an unquenchable firebecause of all your sins .
24:21:013:0	I will personally fight against the people in Jerusalem , that mighty fortress — the people who boast , “ No one can touch us here.No one can break in here . ”
24:21:014:0	And I myself will punish you for your sinfulness , says the Lord.I will light a fire in your foreststhat will burn up everything around you . ' ”
