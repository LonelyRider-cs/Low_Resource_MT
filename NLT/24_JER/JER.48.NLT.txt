24:48:001:1	A Message about Moab
24:48:001:0	This message was given concerning Moab . This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : “ What sorrow awaits the city of Nebo ; it will soon lie in ruins.The city of Kiriathaim will be humiliated and captured ; the fortress will be humiliated and broken down .
24:48:002:0	No one will ever brag about Moab again , for in Heshbon there is a plot to destroy her. ‘ Come , ' they say , ‘ we will cut her off from being a nation . 'The town of Madmen , too , will be silenced ; the sword will follow you there .
24:48:003:0	Listen to the cries from Horonaim , cries of devastation and great destruction .
24:48:004:0	All Moab is destroyed.Her little ones will cry out .
24:48:005:0	Her refugees weep bitterly , climbing the slope to Luhith.They cry out in terror , descending the slope to Horonaim .
24:48:006:0	Flee for your lives ! Hide in the wilderness !
24:48:007:0	Because you have trusted in your wealth and skill , you will be taken captive.Your god Chemosh , with his priests and officials , will be hauled off to distant lands !
24:48:008:0	“ All the towns will be destroyed , and no one will escape—either on the plateaus or in the valleys , for the Lord has spoken .
24:48:009:0	Oh , that Moab had wingsso she could fly away , for her towns will be left empty , with no one living in them .
24:48:010:0	Cursed are those who refuse to do the Lord 's work , who hold back their swords from shedding blood !
24:48:011:0	“ From his earliest history , Moab has lived in peace , never going into exile.He is like wine that has been allowed to settle.He has not been poured from flask to flask , and he is now fragrant and smooth .
24:48:012:0	But the time is coming soon , ” says the Lord , “ when I will send men to pour him from his jar.They will pour him out , then shatter the jar !
24:48:013:0	At last Moab will be ashamed of his idol Chemosh , as the people of Israel were ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel .
24:48:014:0	“ You used to boast , ‘ We are heroes , mighty men of war . '
24:48:015:0	But now Moab and his towns will be destroyed.His most promising youth are doomed to slaughter , ” says the King , whose name is the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
24:48:016:0	“ Destruction is coming fast for Moab ; calamity threatens ominously .
24:48:017:0	You friends of Moab , weep for him and cry ! See how the strong scepter is broken , how the beautiful staff is shattered !
24:48:018:0	“ Come down from your gloryand sit in the dust , you people of Dibon , for those who destroy Moab will shatter Dibon , too.They will tear down all your towers .
24:48:019:0	You people of Aroer , stand beside the road and watch.Shout to those who flee from Moab , ‘ What has happened there ? '
24:48:020:0	“ And the reply comes back , ‘ Moab lies in ruins , disgraced ; weep and wail ! Tell it by the banks of the Arnon River : Moab has been destroyed ! '
24:48:021:0	Judgment has been poured out on the towns of the plateau—on Holon and Jahaz and Mephaath ,
24:48:022:0	on Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim ,
24:48:023:0	on Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon ,
24:48:024:0	on Kerioth and Bozrah—all the towns of Moab , far and near .
24:48:025:0	“ The strength of Moab has ended.His arm has been broken , ” says the Lord .
24:48:026:0	“ Let him stagger and fall like a drunkard , for he has rebelled against the Lord.Moab will wallow in his own vomit , ridiculed by all .
24:48:027:0	Did you not ridicule the people of Israel ? Were they caught in the company of thievesthat you should despise them as you do ?
24:48:028:0	“ You people of Moab , flee from your towns and live in the caves.Hide like doves that nestin the clefts of the rocks .
24:48:029:0	We have all heard of the pride of Moab , for his pride is very great.We know of his lofty pride , his arrogance , and his haughty heart .
24:48:030:0	I know about his insolence , ” says the Lord , “ but his boasts are empty—as empty as his deeds .
24:48:031:0	So now I wail for Moab ; yes , I will mourn for Moab.My heart is broken for the men of Kir-hareseth .
24:48:032:0	“ You people of Sibmah , rich in vineyards , I will weep for you even more than I did for Jazer.Your spreading vines once reached as far as the Dead Sea , but the destroyer has stripped you bare ! He has harvested your grapes and summer fruits .
24:48:033:0	Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab.The presses yield no wine.No one treads the grapes with shouts of joy.There is shouting , yes , but not of joy .
24:48:034:0	“ Instead , their awful cries of terror can be heard from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and Jahaz ; from Zoar all the way to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah . Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up now .
24:48:035:0	“ I will put an end to Moab , ” says the Lord , “ for the people offer sacrifices at the pagan shrines and burn incense to their false gods .
24:48:036:0	My heart moans like a flute for Moab and Kir-hareseth , for all their wealth has disappeared .
24:48:037:0	The people shave their heads and beards in mourning . They slash their hands and put on clothes made of burlap .
24:48:038:0	There is crying and sorrow in every Moabite home and on every street . For I have smashed Moab like an old , unwanted jar .
24:48:039:0	How it is shattered ! Hear the wailing ! See the shame of Moab ! It has become an object of ridicule , an example of ruin to all its neighbors . ”
24:48:040:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Look ! The enemy swoops down like an eagle , spreading his wings over Moab .
24:48:041:0	Its cities will fall , and its strongholds will be seized.Even the mightiest warriors will be in anguishlike a woman in labor .
24:48:042:0	Moab will no longer be a nation , for it has boasted against the Lord .
24:48:043:0	“ Terror and traps and snares will be your lot , O Moab , ” says the Lord .
24:48:044:0	“ Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap , and those who escape the trap will step into a snare.I will see to it that you do not get away , for the time of your judgment has come , ” says the Lord .
24:48:045:0	“ The people flee as far as Heshbonbut are unable to go on.For a fire comes from Heshbon , King Sihon 's ancient home , to devour the entire landwith all its rebellious people .
24:48:046:0	“ What sorrow awaits you , O people of Moab ! The people of the god Chemosh are destroyed ! Your sons and your daughtershave been taken away as captives .
24:48:047:0	But I will restore the fortunes of Moabin days to come.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ” This is the end of Jeremiah 's prophecy concerning Moab .
