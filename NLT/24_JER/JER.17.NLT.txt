24:17:001:1	Judah 's Sin and Punishment
24:17:001:0	“ The sin of Judahis inscribed with an iron chisel — engraved with a diamond point on their stony heartsand on the corners of their altars .
24:17:002:0	Even their children go to worshipat their pagan altars and Asherah poles , beneath every green treeand on every high hill .
24:17:003:0	So I will hand over my holy mountain — along with all your wealth and treasuresand your pagan shrines — as plunder to your enemies , for sin runs rampant in your land .
24:17:002:1	Wisdom from the
24:17:003:1	Lord
24:17:004:0	The wonderful possession I have reserved for youwill slip from your hands.I will tell your enemies to take youas captives to a foreign land.For my anger blazes like a firethat will burn forever . ”
24:17:005:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans , who rely on human strengthand turn their hearts away from the Lord .
24:17:006:0	They are like stunted shrubs in the desert , with no hope for the future.They will live in the barren wilderness , in an uninhabited salty land .
24:17:007:0	“ But blessed are those who trust in the Lordand have made the Lord their hope and confidence .
24:17:008:0	They are like trees planted along a riverbank , with roots that reach deep into the water.Such trees are not bothered by the heator worried by long months of drought.Their leaves stay green , and they never stop producing fruit .
24:17:009:0	“ The human heart is the most deceitful of all things , and desperately wicked.Who really knows how bad it is ?
24:17:004:1	Jeremiah 's Trust in the
24:17:005:1	Lord
24:17:010:0	But I , the Lord , search all heartsand examine secret motives.I give all people their due rewards , according to what their actions deserve . ”
24:17:011:0	Like a partridge that hatches eggs she has not laid , so are those who get their wealth by unjust means.At midlife they will lose their riches ; in the end , they will become poor old fools .
24:17:012:0	But we worship at your throne — eternal , high , and glorious !
24:17:013:0	O Lord , the hope of Israel , all who turn away from you will be disgraced.They will be buried in the dust of the earth , for they have abandoned the Lord , the fountain of living water .
24:17:014:0	O Lord , if you heal me , I will be truly healed ; if you save me , I will be truly saved.My praises are for you alone !
24:17:015:0	People scoff at me and say , “ What is this ‘ message from the Lord ' you talk about ? Why do n't your predictions come true ? ”
24:17:016:0	Lord , I have not abandoned my jobas a shepherd for your people.I have not urged you to send disaster.You have heard everything I 've said .
24:17:017:0	Lord , do n't terrorize me ! You alone are my hope in the day of disaster .
24:17:006:1	Observing the Sabbath
24:17:018:0	Bring shame and dismay on all who persecute me , but do n't let me experience shame and dismay.Bring a day of terror on them.Yes , bring double destruction upon them !
24:17:019:0	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Go and stand in the gates of Jerusalem , first in the gate where the king goes in and out , and then in each of the other gates .
24:17:020:0	Say to all the people , ‘ Listen to this message from the Lord , you kings of Judah and all you people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem .
24:17:021:0	This is what the Lord says : Listen to my warning ! Stop carrying on your trade at Jerusalem 's gates on the Sabbath day .
24:17:022:0	Do not do your work on the Sabbath , but make it a holy day . I gave this command to your ancestors ,
24:17:023:0	but they did not listen or obey . They stubbornly refused to pay attention or accept my discipline .
24:17:024:0	“ ‘ But if you obey me , says the Lord , and do not carry on your trade at the gates or work on the Sabbath day , and if you keep it holy ,
24:17:025:0	then kings and their officials will go in and out of these gates forever . There will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem . Kings and their officials will always ride in and out among the people of Judah in chariots and on horses , and this city will remain forever .
24:17:026:0	And from all around Jerusalem , from the towns of Judah and Benjamin , from the western foothills and the hill country and the Negev , the people will come with their burnt offerings and sacrifices . They will bring their grain offerings , frankincense , and thanksgiving offerings to the Lord 's Temple .
24:17:027:0	“ ‘ But if you do not listen to me and refuse to keep the Sabbath holy , and if on the Sabbath day you bring loads of merchandise through the gates of Jerusalem just as on other days , then I will set fire to these gates . The fire will spread to the palaces , and no one will be able to put out the roaring flames . ' ”
