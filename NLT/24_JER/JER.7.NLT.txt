24:7:001:1	Jeremiah Speaks at the Temple
24:7:001:0	The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah . He said ,
24:7:002:0	“ Go to the entrance of the Lord 's Temple , and give this message to the people : ‘ O Judah , listen to this message from the Lord ! Listen to it , all of you who worship here !
24:7:003:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : “ ‘ Even now , if you quit your evil ways , I will let you stay in your own land .
24:7:004:0	But do n't be fooled by those who promise you safety simply because the Lord 's Temple is here . They chant , “ The Lord 's Temple is here ! The Lord 's Temple is here ! ”
24:7:005:0	But I will be merciful only if you stop your evil thoughts and deeds and start treating each other with justice ;
24:7:006:0	only if you stop exploiting foreigners , orphans , and widows ; only if you stop your murdering ; and only if you stop harming yourselves by worshiping idols .
24:7:007:0	Then I will let you stay in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever .
24:7:008:0	“ ‘ Do n't be fooled into thinking that you will never suffer because the Temple is here . It 's a lie !
24:7:009:0	Do you really think you can steal , murder , commit adultery , lie , and burn incense to Baal and all those other new gods of yours ,
24:7:010:0	and then come here and stand before me in my Temple and chant , “ We are safe ! ” —only to go right back to all those evils again ?
24:7:011:0	Do n't you yourselves admit that this Temple , which bears my name , has become a den of thieves ? Surely I see all the evil going on there . I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:7:012:0	“ ‘ Go now to the place at Shiloh where I once put the Tabernacle that bore my name . See what I did there because of all the wickedness of my people , the Israelites .
24:7:013:0	While you were doing these wicked things , says the Lord , I spoke to you about it repeatedly , but you would not listen . I called out to you , but you refused to answer .
24:7:014:0	So just as I destroyed Shiloh , I will now destroy this Temple that bears my name , this Temple that you trust in for help , this place that I gave to you and your ancestors .
24:7:002:1	Judah 's Persistent Idolatry
24:7:015:0	And I will send you out of my sight into exile , just as I did your relatives , the people of Israel . '
24:7:016:0	“ Pray no more for these people , Jeremiah . Do not weep or pray for them , and do n't beg me to help them , for I will not listen to you .
24:7:017:0	Do n't you see what they are doing throughout the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
24:7:018:0	No wonder I am so angry ! Watch how the children gather wood and the fathers build sacrificial fires . See how the women knead dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven . And they pour out liquid offerings to their other idol gods !
24:7:019:0	Am I the one they are hurting ? ” asks the Lord . “ Most of all , they hurt themselves , to their own shame . ”
24:7:020:0	So this is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ I will pour out my terrible fury on this place . Its people , animals , trees , and crops will be consumed by the unquenchable fire of my anger . ”
24:7:021:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : “ Take your burnt offerings and your other sacrifices and eat them yourselves !
24:7:022:0	When I led your ancestors out of Egypt , it was not burnt offerings and sacrifices I wanted from them .
24:7:023:0	This is what I told them : ‘ Obey me , and I will be your God , and you will be my people . Do everything as I say , and all will be well ! '
24:7:024:0	“ But my people would not listen to me . They kept doing whatever they wanted , following the stubborn desires of their evil hearts . They went backward instead of forward .
24:7:025:0	From the day your ancestors left Egypt until now , I have continued to send my servants , the prophets—day in and day out .
24:7:026:0	But my people have not listened to me or even tried to hear . They have been stubborn and sinful—even worse than their ancestors .
24:7:027:0	“ Tell them all this , but do not expect them to listen . Shout out your warnings , but do not expect them to respond .
24:7:028:0	Say to them , ‘ This is the nation whose people will not obey the Lord their God and who refuse to be taught . Truth has vanished from among them ; it is no longer heard on their lips .
24:7:003:1	The Valley of Slaughter
24:7:029:0	Shave your head in mourning , and weep alone on the mountains . For the Lord has rejected and forsaken this generation that has provoked his fury . '
24:7:030:0	“ The people of Judah have sinned before my very eyes , ” says the Lord . “ They have set up their abominable idols right in the Temple that bears my name , defiling it .
24:7:031:0	They have built pagan shrines at Topheth , the garbage dump in the valley of Ben-Hinnom , and there they burn their sons and daughters in the fire . I have never commanded such a horrible deed ; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing !
24:7:032:0	So beware , for the time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when that garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-Hinnom , but the Valley of Slaughter . They will bury the bodies in Topheth until there is no more room for them .
24:7:033:0	The bodies of my people will be food for the vultures and wild animals , and no one will be left to scare them away .
24:7:034:0	I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in the streets of Jerusalem . The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard in the towns of Judah . The land will lie in complete desolation .
