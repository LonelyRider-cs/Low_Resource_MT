24:24:001:1	Good and Bad Figs
24:24:001:0	After King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon exiled Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , to Babylon along with the officials of Judah and all the craftsmen and artisans , the Lord gave me this vision . I saw two baskets of figs placed in front of the Lord 's Temple in Jerusalem .
24:24:002:0	One basket was filled with fresh , ripe figs , while the other was filled with bad figs that were too rotten to eat .
24:24:003:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I replied , “ Figs , some very good and some very bad , too rotten to eat . ”
24:24:004:0	Then the Lord gave me this message :
24:24:005:0	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : The good figs represent the exiles I sent from Judah to the land of the Babylonians .
24:24:006:0	I will watch over and care for them , and I will bring them back here again . I will build them up and not tear them down . I will plant them and not uproot them .
24:24:007:0	I will give them hearts that recognize me as the Lord . They will be my people , and I will be their God , for they will return to me wholeheartedly .
24:24:008:0	“ But the bad figs , ” the Lord said , “ represent King Zedekiah of Judah , his officials , all the people left in Jerusalem , and those who live in Egypt . I will treat them like bad figs , too rotten to eat .
24:24:009:0	I will make them an object of horror and a symbol of evil to every nation on earth . They will be disgraced and mocked , taunted and cursed , wherever I scatter them .
24:24:010:0	And I will send war , famine , and disease until they have vanished from the land of Israel , which I gave to them and their ancestors . ”
