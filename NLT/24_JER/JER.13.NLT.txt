24:13:001:1	Jeremiah 's Linen Loincloth
24:13:001:0	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it on , but do not wash it . ”
24:13:002:0	So I bought the loincloth as the Lord directed me , and I put it on .
24:13:003:0	Then the Lord gave me another message :
24:13:004:0	“ Take the linen loincloth you are wearing , and go to the Euphrates River . Hide it there in a hole in the rocks . ”
24:13:005:0	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord had instructed me .
24:13:006:0	A long time afterward the Lord said to me , “ Go back to the Euphrates and get the loincloth I told you to hide there . ”
24:13:007:0	So I went to the Euphrates and dug it out of the hole where I had hidden it . But now it was rotting and falling apart . The loincloth was good for nothing .
24:13:008:0	Then I received this message from the Lord :
24:13:009:0	“ This is what the Lord says : This shows how I will rot away the pride of Judah and Jerusalem .
24:13:010:0	These wicked people refuse to listen to me . They stubbornly follow their own desires and worship other gods . Therefore , they will become like this loincloth — good for nothing !
24:13:011:0	As a loincloth clings to a man 's waist , so I created Judah and Israel to cling to me , says the Lord . They were to be my people , my pride , my glory — an honor to my name . But they would not listen to me .
24:13:012:0	“ So tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : May all your jars be filled with wine . ' And they will reply , ‘ Of course ! Jars are made to be filled with wine ! '
24:13:013:0	“ Then tell them , ‘ No , this is what the Lord means : I will fill everyone in this land with drunkenness — from the king sitting on David 's throne to the priests and the prophets , right down to the common people of Jerusalem .
24:13:002:1	A Warning against Pride
24:13:014:0	I will smash them against each other , even parents against children , says the Lord . I will not let my pity or mercy or compassion keep me from destroying them . ' ”
24:13:015:0	Listen and pay attention ! Do not be arrogant , for the Lord has spoken .
24:13:016:0	Give glory to the Lord your Godbefore it is too late.Acknowledge him before he brings darkness upon you , causing you to stumble and fall on the darkening mountains.For then , when you look for light , you will find only terrible darkness and gloom .
24:13:017:0	And if you still refuse to listen , I will weep alone because of your pride.My eyes will overflow with tears , because the Lord 's flock will be led away into exile .
24:13:018:0	Say to the king and his mother , “ Come down from your thronesand sit in the dust , for your glorious crownswill soon be snatched from your heads . ”
24:13:019:0	The towns of the Negev will close their gates , and no one will be able to open them.The people of Judah will be taken away as captives.All will be carried into exile .
24:13:020:0	Open up your eyes and seethe armies marching down from the north ! Where is your flock — your beautiful flock — that he gave you to care for ?
24:13:021:0	What will you say when the Lord takes the allies you have cultivatedand appoints them as your rulers ? Pangs of anguish will grip you , like those of a woman in labor !
24:13:022:0	You may ask yourself , “ Why is all this happening to me ? ” It is because of your many sins ! That is why you have been strippedand raped by invading armies .
24:13:023:0	Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin ? Can a leopard take away its spots ? Neither can you start doing good , for you have always done evil .
24:13:024:0	“ I will scatter you like chaffthat is blown away by the desert winds .
24:13:025:0	This is your allotment , the portion I have assigned to you , ” says the Lord , “ for you have forgotten me , putting your trust in false gods .
24:13:026:0	I myself will strip youand expose you to shame .
24:13:027:0	I have seen your adultery and lust , and your disgusting idol worship out in the fields and on the hills.What sorrow awaits you , Jerusalem ! How long before you are pure ? ”
