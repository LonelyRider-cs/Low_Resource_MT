24:10:001:1	Idolatry Brings Destruction
24:10:001:0	Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you , O Israel !
24:10:002:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Do not act like the other nations , who try to read their future in the stars.Do not be afraid of their predictions , even though other nations are terrified by them .
24:10:003:0	Their ways are futile and foolish.They cut down a tree , and a craftsman carves an idol .
24:10:004:0	They decorate it with gold and silverand then fasten it securely with hammer and nailsso it wo n't fall over .
24:10:005:0	Their gods are likehelpless scarecrows in a cucumber field ! They can not speak , and they need to be carried because they can not walk.Do not be afraid of such gods , for they can neither harm you nor do you any good . ”
24:10:006:0	Lord , there is no one like you ! For you are great , and your name is full of power .
24:10:007:0	Who would not fear you , O King of nations ? That title belongs to you alone ! Among all the wise people of the earthand in all the kingdoms of the world , there is no one like you .
24:10:008:0	People who worship idols are stupid and foolish.The things they worship are made of wood !
24:10:009:0	They bring beaten sheets of silver from Tarshishand gold from Uphaz , and they give these materials to skillful craftsmenwho make their idols.Then they dress these gods in royal blue and purple robesmade by expert tailors .
24:10:010:0	But the Lord is the only true God.He is the living God and the everlasting King ! The whole earth trembles at his anger.The nations can not stand up to his wrath .
24:10:011:0	Say this to those who worship other gods : “ Your so-called gods , who did not make the heavens and earth , will vanish from the earth and from under the heavens . ”
24:10:012:0	But the Lord made the earth by his power , and he preserves it by his wisdom.With his own understandinghe stretched out the heavens .
24:10:013:0	When he speaks in the thunder , the heavens roar with rain.He causes the clouds to rise over the earth.He sends the lightning with the rainand releases the wind from his storehouses .
24:10:014:0	The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge ! The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make , for their carefully shaped works are a fraud.These idols have no breath or power .
24:10:015:0	Idols are worthless ; they are ridiculous lies ! On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed .
24:10:002:1	The Coming Destruction
24:10:016:0	But the God of Israel is no idol ! He is the Creator of everything that exists , including Israel , his own special possession.The Lord of Heaven 's Armies is his name !
24:10:017:0	Pack your bags and prepare to leave ; the siege is about to begin .
24:10:018:0	For this is what the Lord says : “ Suddenly , I will fling outall you who live in this land.I will pour great troubles upon you , and at last you will feel my anger . ”
24:10:019:0	My wound is severe , and my grief is great.My sickness is incurable , but I must bear it .
24:10:020:0	My home is gone , and no one is left to help me rebuild it.My children have been taken away , and I will never see them again .
24:10:021:0	The shepherds of my people have lost their senses.They no longer seek wisdom from the Lord.Therefore , they fail completely , and their flocks are scattered .
24:10:003:1	Jeremiah 's Prayer
24:10:022:0	Listen ! Hear the terrifying roar of great armiesas they roll down from the north.The towns of Judah will be destroyedand become a haunt for jackals .
24:10:023:0	I know , Lord , that our lives are not our own.We are not able to plan our own course .
24:10:024:0	So correct me , Lord , but please be gentle.Do not correct me in anger , for I would die .
24:10:025:0	Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you—on the peoples that do not call upon your name.For they have devoured your people Israel ; they have devoured and consumed them , making the land a desolate wilderness .
