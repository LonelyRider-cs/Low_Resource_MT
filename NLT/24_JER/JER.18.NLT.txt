24:18:001:1	The Potter and the Clay
24:18:001:0	The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah . He said ,
24:18:002:0	“ Go down to the potter 's shop , and I will speak to you there . ”
24:18:003:0	So I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel .
24:18:004:0	But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped , so he crushed it into a lump of clay again and started over .
24:18:005:0	Then the Lord gave me this message :
24:18:006:0	“ O Israel , can I not do to you as this potter has done to his clay ? As the clay is in the potter 's hand , so are you in my hand .
24:18:007:0	If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted , torn down , and destroyed ,
24:18:008:0	but then that nation renounces its evil ways , I will not destroy it as I had planned .
24:18:009:0	And if I announce that I will plant and build up a certain nation or kingdom ,
24:18:010:0	but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me , I will not bless it as I said I would .
24:18:011:0	“ Therefore , Jeremiah , go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem . Say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I am planning disaster for you instead of good . So turn from your evil ways , each of you , and do what is right . ' ”
24:18:012:0	But the people replied , “ Do n't waste your breath . We will continue to live as we want to , stubbornly following our own evil desires . ”
24:18:013:0	So this is what the Lord says : “ Has anyone ever heard of such a thing , even among the pagan nations ? My virgin daughter Israelhas done something terrible !
24:18:014:0	Does the snow ever disappear from the mountaintops of Lebanon ? Do the cold streams flowing from those distant mountains ever run dry ?
24:18:015:0	But my people are not so reliable , for they have deserted me ; they burn incense to worthless idols.They have stumbled off the ancient highwaysand walk in muddy paths .
24:18:016:0	Therefore , their land will become desolate , a monument to their stupidity.All who pass by will be astonishedand will shake their heads in amazement .
24:18:002:1	A Plot against Jeremiah
24:18:017:0	I will scatter my people before their enemiesas the east wind scatters dust.And in all their trouble I will turn my back on themand refuse to notice their distress . ”
24:18:018:0	Then the people said , “ Come on , let 's plot a way to stop Jeremiah . We have plenty of priests and wise men and prophets . We do n't need him to teach the word and give us advice and prophecies . Let 's spread rumors about him and ignore what he says . ”
24:18:019:0	Lord , hear me and help me ! Listen to what my enemies are saying .
24:18:020:0	Should they repay evil for good ? They have dug a pit to kill me , though I pleaded for themand tried to protect them from your anger .
24:18:021:0	So let their children starve ! Let them die by the sword ! Let their wives become childless widows.Let their old men die in a plague , and let their young men be killed in battle !
24:18:022:0	Let screaming be heard from their homesas warriors come suddenly upon them.For they have dug a pit for meand have hidden traps along my path .
24:18:023:0	Lord , you know all about their murderous plots against me.Do n't forgive their crimes and blot out their sins.Let them die before you.Deal with them in your anger .
