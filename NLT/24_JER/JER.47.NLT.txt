24:47:001:1	A Message about Philistia
24:47:001:0	This is the Lord 's message to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines of Gaza , before it was captured by the Egyptian army .
24:47:002:0	This is what the Lord says : “ A flood is coming from the northto overflow the land.It will destroy the land and everything in it — cities and people alike.People will scream in terror , and everyone in the land will wail .
24:47:003:0	Hear the clatter of stallions ' hoovesand the rumble of wheels as the chariots rush by.Terrified fathers run madly , without a backward glance at their helpless children .
24:47:004:0	“ The time has come for the Philistines to be destroyed , along with their allies from Tyre and Sidon.Yes , the Lord is destroying the remnant of the Philistines , those colonists from the island of Crete .
24:47:005:0	Gaza will be humiliated , its head shaved bald ; Ashkelon will lie silent.You remnant from the Mediterranean coast , how long will you cut yourselves in mourning ?
24:47:006:0	“ Now , O sword of the Lord , when will you be at rest again ? Go back into your sheath ; rest and be still .
24:47:007:0	“ But how can it be stillwhen the Lord has sent it on a mission ? For the city of Ashkelonand the people living along the seamust be destroyed . ”
