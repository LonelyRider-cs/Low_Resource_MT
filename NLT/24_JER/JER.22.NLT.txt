24:22:001:1	A Message for Judah 's Kings
24:22:001:0	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Go over and speak directly to the king of Judah . Say to him ,
24:22:002:0	‘ Listen to this message from the Lord , you king of Judah , sitting on David 's throne . Let your attendants and your people listen , too .
24:22:003:0	This is what the Lord says : Be fair-minded and just . Do what is right ! Help those who have been robbed ; rescue them from their oppressors . Quit your evil deeds ! Do not mistreat foreigners , orphans , and widows . Stop murdering the innocent !
24:22:004:0	If you obey me , there will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem . The king will ride through the palace gates in chariots and on horses , with his parade of attendants and subjects .
24:22:002:1	A Message about the Palace
24:22:005:0	But if you refuse to pay attention to this warning , I swear by my own name , says the Lord , that this palace will become a pile of rubble . ' ”
24:22:006:0	Now this is what the Lord says concerning Judah 's royal palace : “ I love you as much as fruitful Gileadand the green forests of Lebanon.But I will turn you into a desert , with no one living within your walls .
24:22:007:0	I will call for wreckers , who will bring out their tools to dismantle you.They will tear out all your fine cedar beamsand throw them on the fire .
24:22:008:0	“ People from many nations will pass by the ruins of this city and say to one another , ‘ Why did the Lord destroy such a great city ? '
24:22:003:1	A Message about Jehoahaz
24:22:009:0	And the answer will be , ‘ Because they violated their covenant with the Lord their God by worshiping other gods . ' ”
24:22:010:0	Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss.Instead , weep for the captive king being led away ! For he will never return to see his native land again .
24:22:011:0	For this is what the Lord says about Jehoahaz , who succeeded his father , King Josiah , and was taken away as a captive : “ He will never return .
24:22:004:1	A Message about Jehoiakim
24:22:012:0	He will die in a distant land and will never again see his own country . ”
24:22:013:0	And the Lord says , “ What sorrow awaits Jehoiakim , who builds his palace with forced labor.He builds injustice into its walls , for he makes his neighbors work for nothing.He does not pay them for their labor .
24:22:014:0	He says , ‘ I will build a magnificent palacewith huge rooms and many windows.I will panel it throughout with fragrant cedarand paint it a lovely red . '
24:22:015:0	But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king ! Your father , Josiah , also had plenty to eat and drink.But he was just and right in all his dealings.That is why God blessed him .
24:22:016:0	He gave justice and help to the poor and needy , and everything went well for him.Is n't that what it means to know me ? ” says the Lord .
24:22:017:0	“ But you ! You have eyes only for greed and dishonesty ! You murder the innocent , oppress the poor , and reign ruthlessly . ”
24:22:018:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim , son of King Josiah : “ The people will not mourn for him , crying to one another , ‘ Alas , my brother ! Alas , my sister ! 'His subjects will not mourn for him , crying , ‘ Alas , our master is dead ! Alas , his splendor is gone ! '
24:22:019:0	He will be buried like a dead donkey — dragged out of Jerusalem and dumped outside the gates !
24:22:020:0	Weep for your allies in Lebanon.Shout for them in Bashan.Search for them in the regions east of the river.See , they are all destroyed.Not one is left to help you .
24:22:021:0	I warned you when you were prosperous , but you replied , ‘ Do n't bother me . 'You have been that way since childhood — you simply will not obey me !
24:22:022:0	And now the wind will blow away your allies.All your friends will be taken away as captives.Surely then you will see your wickedness and be ashamed .
24:22:005:1	A Message for Jehoiachin
24:22:023:0	It may be nice to live in a beautiful palacepaneled with wood from the cedars of Lebanon , but soon you will groan with pangs of anguish — anguish like that of a woman in labor .
24:22:024:0	“ As surely as I live , ” says the Lord , “ I will abandon you , Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah . Even if you were the signet ring on my right hand , I would pull you off .
24:22:025:0	I will hand you over to those who seek to kill you , those you so desperately fear — to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the mighty Babylonian army .
24:22:026:0	I will expel you and your mother from this land , and you will die in a foreign country , not in your native land .
24:22:027:0	You will never again return to the land you yearn for .
24:22:028:0	“ Why is this man Jehoiachin like a discarded , broken jar ? Why are he and his children to be exiled to a foreign land ?
24:22:029:0	O earth , earth , earth ! Listen to this message from the Lord !
24:22:030:0	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Let the record show that this man Jehoiachin was childless.He is a failure , for none of his children will succeed him on the throne of Davidto rule over Judah . '
