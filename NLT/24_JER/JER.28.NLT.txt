24:28:001:1	Jeremiah Condemns Hananiah
24:28:001:0	One day in late summer of that same year — the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah , king of Judah — Hananiah son of Azzur , a prophet from Gibeon , addressed me publicly in the Temple while all the priests and people listened . He said ,
24:28:002:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I will remove the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks .
24:28:003:0	Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon .
24:28:004:0	And I will bring back Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and all the other captives that were taken to Babylon . I will surely break the yoke that the king of Babylon has put on your necks . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ' ”
24:28:005:0	Jeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests and people at the Temple .
24:28:006:0	He said , “ Amen ! May your prophecies come true ! I hope the Lord does everything you say . I hope he does bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple and all the captives .
24:28:007:0	But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people .
24:28:008:0	The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations , always warning of war , disaster , and disease .
24:28:009:0	So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right . Only when his predictions come true can we know that he is really from the Lord . ”
24:28:010:0	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah 's neck and broke it in pieces .
24:28:011:0	And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ Just as this yoke has been broken , within two years I will break the yoke of oppression from all the nations now subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . ' ” With that , Jeremiah left the Temple area .
24:28:012:0	Soon after this confrontation with Hananiah , the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
24:28:013:0	“ Go and tell Hananiah , ‘ This is what the Lord says : You have broken a wooden yoke , but you have replaced it with a yoke of iron .
24:28:014:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations , forcing them into slavery under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . I have put everything , even the wild animals , under his control . ' ”
24:28:015:0	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah , “ Listen , Hananiah ! The Lord has not sent you , but the people believe your lies .
24:28:016:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord says : ‘ You must die . Your life will end this very year because you have rebelled against the Lord . ' ”
24:28:017:0	Two months later the prophet Hananiah died .
