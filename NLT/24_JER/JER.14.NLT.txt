24:14:001:1	Judah 's Terrible Drought
24:14:001:0	This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord , explaining why he was holding back the rain :
24:14:002:0	“ Judah wilts ; commerce at the city gates grinds to a halt.All the people sit on the ground in mourning , and a great cry rises from Jerusalem .
24:14:003:0	The nobles send servants to get water , but all the wells are dry.The servants return with empty pitchers , confused and desperate , covering their heads in grief .
24:14:004:0	The ground is parchedand cracked for lack of rain.The farmers are deeply troubled ; they , too , cover their heads .
24:14:005:0	Even the doe abandons her newborn fawnbecause there is no grass in the field .
24:14:006:0	The wild donkeys stand on the bare hillspanting like thirsty jackals.They strain their eyes looking for grass , but there is none to be found . ”
24:14:007:0	The people say , “ Our wickedness has caught up with us , Lord , but help us for the sake of your own reputation.We have turned away from youand sinned against you again and again .
24:14:008:0	O Hope of Israel , our Savior in times of trouble , why are you like a stranger to us ? Why are you like a traveler passing through the land , stopping only for the night ?
24:14:009:0	Are you also confused ? Is our champion helpless to save us ? You are right here among us , Lord.We are known as your people.Please do n't abandon us now ! ”
24:14:002:1	The
24:14:003:1	Lord
24:14:004:1	Forbids Jeremiah to Intercede
24:14:010:0	So this is what the Lord says to his people : “ You love to wander far from meand do not restrain yourselves.Therefore , I will no longer accept you as my people.Now I will remember all your wickednessand will punish you for your sins . ”
24:14:011:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Do not pray for these people anymore .
24:14:012:0	When they fast , I will pay no attention . When they present their burnt offerings and grain offerings to me , I will not accept them . Instead , I will devour them with war , famine , and disease . ”
24:14:013:0	Then I said , “ O Sovereign Lord , their prophets are telling them , ‘ All is well—no war or famine will come . The Lord will surely send you peace . ' ”
24:14:014:0	Then the Lord said , “ These prophets are telling lies in my name . I did not send them or tell them to speak . I did not give them any messages . They prophesy of visions and revelations they have never seen or heard . They speak foolishness made up in their own lying hearts .
24:14:015:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord says : I will punish these lying prophets , for they have spoken in my name even though I never sent them . They say that no war or famine will come , but they themselves will die by war and famine !
24:14:016:0	As for the people to whom they prophesy—their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem , victims of famine and war . There will be no one left to bury them . Husbands , wives , sons , and daughters—all will be gone . For I will pour out their own wickedness on them .
24:14:017:0	Now , Jeremiah , say this to them : “ Night and day my eyes overflow with tears.I can not stop weeping , for my virgin daughter—my precious people—has been struck downand lies mortally wounded .
24:14:005:1	A Prayer for Healing
24:14:018:0	If I go out into the fields , I see the bodies of people slaughtered by the enemy.If I walk the city streets , I see people who have died of starvation.The prophets and priests continue with their work , but they do n't know what they 're doing . ”
24:14:019:0	Lord , have you completely rejected Judah ? Do you really hate Jerusalem ? Why have you wounded us past all hope of healing ? We hoped for peace , but no peace came.We hoped for a time of healing , but found only terror .
24:14:020:0	Lord , we confess our wickednessand that of our ancestors , too.We all have sinned against you .
24:14:021:0	For the sake of your reputation , Lord , do not abandon us.Do not disgrace your own glorious throne.Please remember us , and do not break your covenant with us .
24:14:022:0	Can any of the worthless foreign gods send us rain ? Does it fall from the sky by itself ? No , you are the one , O Lord our God ! Only you can do such things.So we will wait for you to help us .
