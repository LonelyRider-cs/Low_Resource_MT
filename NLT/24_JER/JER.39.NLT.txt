24:39:001:1	The Fall of Jerusalem
24:39:001:0	In January of the ninth year of King Zedekiah 's reign , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with his entire army to besiege Jerusalem .
24:39:002:0	Two and a half years later , on July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah 's reign , a section of the city wall was broken down .
24:39:003:0	All the officers of the Babylonian army came in and sat in triumph at the Middle Gate : Nergal-sharezer of Samgar , and Nebo-sarsekim , a chief officer , and Nergal-sharezer , the king 's adviser , and all the other officers of the king of Babylon .
24:39:004:0	When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw that the Babylonians had broken into the city , they fled . They waited for nightfall and then slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king 's garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley .
24:39:005:0	But the Babylonian troops chased them and overtook Zedekiah on the plains of Jericho . They captured him and took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who was at Riblah in the land of Hamath . There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah .
24:39:006:0	The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons at Riblah . The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah .
24:39:007:0	Then he gouged out Zedekiah 's eyes and bound him in bronze chains to lead him away to Babylon .
24:39:008:0	Meanwhile , the Babylonians burned Jerusalem , including the royal palace and the houses of the people , and they tore down the walls of the city .
24:39:009:0	Then Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , took as exiles to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city , those who had defected to him , and everyone else who remained .

24:39:010:0	But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind in the land of Judah , and he assigned them to care for the vineyards and fields .
24:39:011:0	King Nebuchadnezzar had told Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , to find Jeremiah .
24:39:012:0	“ See that he is n't hurt , ” he said . “ Look after him well , and give him anything he wants . ”
24:39:013:0	So Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard ; Nebushazban , a chief officer ; Nergal-sharezer , the king 's adviser ; and the other officers of Babylon 's king
24:39:014:0	sent messengers to bring Jeremiah out of the prison . They put him under the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan , who took him back to his home . So Jeremiah stayed in Judah among his own people .
24:39:015:0	The Lord had given the following message to Jeremiah while he was still in prison :
24:39:016:0	“ Say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : I will do to this city everything I have threatened . I will send disaster , not prosperity . You will see its destruction ,
24:39:017:0	but I will rescue you from those you fear so much .
24:39:018:0	Because you trusted me , I will give you your life as a reward . I will rescue you and keep you safe . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ' ”
