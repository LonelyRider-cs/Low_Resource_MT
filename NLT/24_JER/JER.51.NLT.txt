24:51:001:0	This is what the Lord says : “ I will stir up a destroyer against Babylonand the people of Babylonia .
24:51:002:0	Foreigners will come and winnow her , blowing her away as chaff.They will come from every sideto rise against her in her day of trouble .
24:51:003:0	Do n't let the archers put on their armoror draw their bows.Do n't spare even her best soldiers ! Let her army be completely destroyed .
24:51:004:0	They will fall dead in the land of the Babylonians , slashed to death in her streets .
24:51:005:0	For the Lord of Heaven 's Armieshas not abandoned Israel and Judah.He is still their God , even though their land was filled with sinagainst the Holy One of Israel . ”
24:51:006:0	Flee from Babylon ! Save yourselves ! Do n't get trapped in her punishment ! It is the Lord 's time for vengeance ; he will repay her in full .
24:51:007:0	Babylon has been a gold cup in the Lord 's hands , a cup that made the whole earth drunk.The nations drank Babylon 's wine , and it drove them all mad .
24:51:008:0	But suddenly Babylon , too , has fallen.Weep for her.Give her medicine.Perhaps she can yet be healed .
24:51:009:0	We would have helped her if we could , but nothing can save her now.Let her go ; abandon her.Return now to your own land.For her punishment reaches to the heavens ; it is so great it can not be measured .
24:51:010:0	The Lord has vindicated us.Come , let us announce in Jerusalemeverything the Lord our God has done .
24:51:011:0	Sharpen the arrows ! Lift up the shields ! For the Lord has inspired the kings of the Medesto march against Babylon and destroy her.This is his vengeance against thosewho desecrated his Temple .
24:51:012:0	Raise the battle flag against Babylon ! Reinforce the guard and station the watchmen.Prepare an ambush , for the Lord will fulfill all his plans against Babylon .
24:51:013:0	You are a city by a great river , a great center of commerce , but your end has come.The thread of your life is cut .
24:51:001:1	A Hymn of Praise to the
24:51:002:1	Lord
24:51:014:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies has taken this vowand has sworn to it by his own name : “ Your cities will be filled with enemies , like fields swarming with locusts , and they will shout in triumph over you . ”
24:51:015:0	The Lord made the earth by his power , and he preserves it by his wisdom.With his own understandinghe stretched out the heavens .
24:51:016:0	When he speaks in the thunder , the heavens roar with rain.He causes the clouds to rise over the earth.He sends the lightning with the rainand releases the wind from his storehouses .
24:51:017:0	The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge ! The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make , for their carefully shaped works are a fraud.These idols have no breath or power .
24:51:018:0	Idols are worthless ; they are ridiculous lies ! On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed .
24:51:003:1	Babylon 's Great Punishment
24:51:019:0	But the God of Israel is no idol ! He is the Creator of everything that exists , including his people , his own special possession.The Lord of Heaven 's Armies is his name !
24:51:020:0	“ You are my battle-ax and sword , ” says the Lord. “ With you I will shatter nationsand destroy many kingdoms .
24:51:021:0	With you I will shatter armies — destroying the horse and rider , the chariot and charioteer .
24:51:022:0	With you I will shatter men and women , old people and children , young men and young women .
24:51:023:0	With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks , farmers and oxen , captains and officers .
24:51:024:0	“ I will repay Babylonand the people of Babyloniafor all the wrong they have doneto my people in Jerusalem , ” says the Lord .
24:51:025:0	“ Look , O mighty mountain , destroyer of the earth ! I am your enemy , ” says the Lord. “ I will raise my fist against you , to knock you down from the heights.When I am finished , you will be nothing but a heap of burnt rubble .
24:51:026:0	You will be desolate forever.Even your stones will never again be used for building.You will be completely wiped out , ” says the Lord .
24:51:027:0	Raise a signal flag to the nations.Sound the battle cry ! Mobilize them all against Babylon.Prepare them to fight against her ! Bring out the armies of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz.Appoint a commander , and bring a multitude of horses like swarming locusts !
24:51:028:0	Bring against her the armies of the nations — led by the kings of the Medesand all their captains and officers .
24:51:029:0	The earth trembles and writhes in pain , for everything the Lord has planned against Babylon stands unchanged.Babylon will be left desolate without a single inhabitant .
24:51:030:0	Her mightiest warriors no longer fight.They stay in their barracks , their courage gone.They have become like women.The invaders have burned the housesand broken down the city gates .
24:51:031:0	The news is passed from one runner to the nextas the messengers hurry to tell the kingthat his city has been captured .
24:51:032:0	All the escape routes are blocked.The marshes have been set aflame , and the army is in a panic .
24:51:033:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : “ Babylon is like wheat on a threshing floor , about to be trampled.In just a little whileher harvest will begin . ”
24:51:034:0	“ King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has eaten and crushed usand drained us of strength.He has swallowed us like a great monsterand filled his belly with our riches.He has thrown us out of our own country .
24:51:004:1	The
24:51:005:1	Lord
24:51:006:1	's Vengeance on Babylon
24:51:035:0	Make Babylon suffer as she made us suffer , ” say the people of Zion. “ Make the people of Babylonia pay for spilling our blood , ” says Jerusalem .
24:51:036:0	This is what the Lord says to Jerusalem : “ I will be your lawyer to plead your case , and I will avenge you.I will dry up her river , as well as her springs ,
24:51:037:0	and Babylon will become a heap of ruins , haunted by jackals.She will be an object of horror and contempt , a place where no one lives .
24:51:038:0	Her people will roar together like strong lions.They will growl like lion cubs .
24:51:039:0	And while they lie inflamed with all their wine , I will prepare a different kind of feast for them.I will make them drink until they fall asleep , and they will never wake up again , ” says the Lord .
24:51:040:0	“ I will bring them downlike lambs to the slaughter , like rams and goats to be sacrificed .
24:51:041:0	“ How Babylon is fallen — great Babylon , praised throughout the earth ! Now she has become an object of horroramong the nations .
24:51:042:0	The sea has risen over Babylon ; she is covered by its crashing waves .
24:51:043:0	Her cities now lie in ruins ; she is a dry wastelandwhere no one lives or even passes by .
24:51:007:1	A Message for the Exiles
24:51:044:0	And I will punish Bel , the god of Babylon , and make him vomit up all he has eaten.The nations will no longer come and worship him.The wall of Babylon has fallen !
24:51:045:0	“ Come out , my people , flee from Babylon.Save yourselves ! Run from the Lord 's fierce anger .
24:51:046:0	But do not panic ; do n't be afraidwhen you hear the first rumor of approaching forces.For rumors will keep coming year by year.Violence will erupt in the landas the leaders fight against each other .
24:51:047:0	For the time is surely comingwhen I will punish this great city and all her idols.Her whole land will be disgraced , and her dead will lie in the streets .
24:51:048:0	Then the heavens and earth will rejoice , for out of the north will come destroying armiesagainst Babylon , ” says the Lord .
24:51:049:0	“ Just as Babylon killed the people of Israeland others throughout the world , so must her people be killed .
24:51:050:0	Get out , all you who have escaped the sword ! Do not stand and watch — flee while you can ! Remember the Lord , though you are in a far-off land , and think about your home in Jerusalem . ”
24:51:051:0	“ We are ashamed , ” the people say. “ We are insulted and disgracedbecause the Lord 's Templehas been defiled by foreigners . ”
24:51:052:0	“ Yes , ” says the Lord , “ but the time is comingwhen I will destroy Babylon 's idols.The groans of her wounded peoplewill be heard throughout the land .
24:51:008:1	Babylon 's Complete Destruction
24:51:053:0	Though Babylon reaches as high as the heavensand makes her fortifications incredibly strong , I will still send enemies to plunder her.I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:51:054:0	“ Listen ! Hear the cry of Babylon , the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians .
24:51:055:0	For the Lord is destroying Babylon.He will silence her loud voice.Waves of enemies pound against her ; the noise of battle rings through the city .
24:51:056:0	Destroying armies come against Babylon.Her mighty men are captured , and their weapons break in their hands.For the Lord is a God who gives just punishment ; he always repays in full .
24:51:057:0	I will make her officials and wise men drunk , along with her captains , officers , and warriors.They will fall asleepand never wake up again ! ” says the King , whose name isthe Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
24:51:009:1	Jeremiah 's Message Sent to Babylon
24:51:058:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ The thick walls of Babylon will be leveled to the ground , and her massive gates will be burned.The builders from many lands have worked in vain , for their work will be destroyed by fire ! ”
24:51:059:0	The prophet Jeremiah gave this message to Seraiah son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah , a staff officer , when Seraiah went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah . This was during the fourth year of Zedekiah 's reign .
24:51:060:0	Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll all the terrible disasters that would soon come upon Babylon — all the words written here .
24:51:061:0	He said to Seraiah , “ When you get to Babylon , read aloud everything on this scroll .
24:51:062:0	Then say , ‘ Lord , you have said that you will destroy Babylon so that neither people nor animals will remain here . She will lie empty and abandoned forever . '
24:51:063:0	When you have finished reading the scroll , tie it to a stone and throw it into the Euphrates River .
24:51:064:0	Then say , ‘ In this same way Babylon and her people will sink , never again to rise , because of the disasters I will bring upon her . ' ” This is the end of Jeremiah 's messages .
