24:12:001:1	Jeremiah Questions the
24:12:002:1	Lord
24:12:003:1	's Justice
24:12:001:0	Lord , you always give me justicewhen I bring a case before you.So let me bring you this complaint : Why are the wicked so prosperous ? Why are evil people so happy ?
24:12:002:0	You have planted them , and they have taken root and prospered.Your name is on their lips , but you are far from their hearts .
24:12:003:0	But as for me , Lord , you know my heart.You see me and test my thoughts.Drag these people away like sheep to be butchered ! Set them aside to be slaughtered !
24:12:004:1	The
24:12:005:1	Lord
24:12:006:1	's Reply to Jeremiah
24:12:004:0	How long must this land mourn ? Even the grass in the fields has withered.The wild animals and birds have disappearedbecause of the evil in the land.For the people have said , “ The Lord does n't see what 's ahead for us ! ”
24:12:005:0	“ If racing against mere men makes you tired , how will you race against horses ? If you stumble and fall on open ground , what will you do in the thickets near the Jordan ?
24:12:006:0	Even your brothers , members of your own family , have turned against you.They plot and raise complaints against you.Do not trust them , no matter how pleasantly they speak .
24:12:007:0	“ I have abandoned my people , my special possession.I have surrendered my dearest ones to their enemies .
24:12:008:0	My chosen people have roared at me like a lion of the forest , so I have treated them with contempt .
24:12:009:0	My chosen people act like speckled vultures , but they themselves are surrounded by vultures.Bring on the wild animals to pick their corpses clean !
24:12:010:0	“ Many rulers have ravaged my vineyard , trampling down the vinesand turning all its beauty into a barren wilderness .
24:12:011:0	They have made it an empty wasteland ; I hear its mournful cry.The whole land is desolate , and no one even cares .
24:12:012:0	On all the bare hilltops , destroying armies can be seen.The sword of the Lord devours peoplefrom one end of the nation to the other.No one will escape !
24:12:007:1	A Message for Israel 's Neighbors
24:12:013:0	My people have planted wheatbut are harvesting thorns.They have worn themselves out , but it has done them no good.They will harvest a crop of shamebecause of the fierce anger of the Lord . ”
24:12:014:0	Now this is what the Lord says : “ I will uproot from their land all the evil nations reaching out for the possession I gave my people Israel . And I will uproot Judah from among them .
24:12:015:0	But afterward I will return and have compassion on all of them . I will bring them home to their own lands again , each nation to its own possession .
24:12:016:0	And if these nations truly learn the ways of my people , and if they learn to swear by my name , saying , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives ' ( just as they taught my people to swear by the name of Baal ) , then they will be given a place among my people .
24:12:017:0	But any nation who refuses to obey me will be uprooted and destroyed . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
