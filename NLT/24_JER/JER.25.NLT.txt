24:25:001:1	Seventy Years of Captivity
24:25:001:0	This message for all the people of Judah came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the fourth year of Jehoiakim 's reign over Judah . This was the year when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon began his reign .
24:25:002:0	Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people in Judah and Jerusalem ,
24:25:003:0	“ For the past twenty-three years — from the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon , king of Judah , until now — the Lord has been giving me his messages . I have faithfully passed them on to you , but you have not listened .
24:25:004:0	“ Again and again the Lord has sent you his servants , the prophets , but you have not listened or even paid attention .
24:25:005:0	Each time the message was this : ‘ Turn from the evil road you are traveling and from the evil things you are doing . Only then will I let you live in this land that the Lord gave to you and your ancestors forever .
24:25:006:0	Do not provoke my anger by worshiping idols you made with your own hands . Then I will not harm you . '
24:25:007:0	“ But you would not listen to me , ” says the Lord . “ You made me furious by worshiping idols you made with your own hands , bringing on yourselves all the disasters you now suffer .
24:25:008:0	And now the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Because you have not listened to me ,
24:25:009:0	I will gather together all the armies of the north under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , whom I have appointed as my deputy . I will bring them all against this land and its people and against the surrounding nations . I will completely destroy you and make you an object of horror and contempt and a ruin forever .
24:25:010:0	I will take away your happy singing and laughter . The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard . Your millstones will fall silent , and the lights in your homes will go out .
24:25:011:0	This entire land will become a desolate wasteland . Israel and her neighboring lands will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years .
24:25:012:0	“ Then , after the seventy years of captivity are over , I will punish the king of Babylon and his people for their sins , ” says the Lord . “ I will make the country of the Babylonians a wasteland forever .
24:25:013:0	I will bring upon them all the terrors I have promised in this book — all the penalties announced by Jeremiah against the nations .
24:25:002:1	The Cup of the
24:25:003:1	Lord
24:25:004:1	's Anger
24:25:014:0	Many nations and great kings will enslave the Babylonians , just as they enslaved my people . I will punish them in proportion to the suffering they cause my people . ”
24:25:015:0	This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , said to me : “ Take from my hand this cup filled to the brim with my anger , and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it .
24:25:016:0	When they drink from it , they will stagger , crazed by the warfare I will send against them . ”
24:25:017:0	So I took the cup of anger from the Lord and made all the nations drink from it — every nation to which the Lord sent me .
24:25:018:0	I went to Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah , and their kings and officials drank from the cup . From that day until this , they have been a desolate ruin , an object of horror , contempt , and cursing .
24:25:019:0	I gave the cup to Pharaoh , king of Egypt , his attendants , his officials , and all his people ,
24:25:020:0	along with all the foreigners living in that land . I also gave it to all the kings of the land of Uz and the kings of the Philistine cities of Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and what remains of Ashdod .
24:25:021:0	Then I gave the cup to the nations of Edom , Moab , and Ammon ,
24:25:022:0	and the kings of Tyre and Sidon , and the kings of the regions across the sea .
24:25:023:0	I gave it to Dedan , Tema , and Buz , and to the people who live in distant places .
24:25:024:0	I gave it to the kings of Arabia , the kings of the nomadic tribes of the desert ,
24:25:025:0	and to the kings of Zimri , Elam , and Media .
24:25:026:0	And I gave it to the kings of the northern countries , far and near , one after the other — all the kingdoms of the world . And finally , the king of Babylon himself drank from the cup of the Lord 's anger .
24:25:027:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Now tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : Drink from this cup of my anger . Get drunk and vomit ; fall to rise no more , for I am sending terrible wars against you . '
24:25:028:0	And if they refuse to accept the cup , tell them , ‘ The Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : You have no choice but to drink from it .
24:25:029:0	I have begun to punish Jerusalem , the city that bears my name . Now should I let you go unpunished ? No , you will not escape disaster . I will call for war against all the nations of the earth . I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken ! '
24:25:030:0	“ Now prophesy all these things , and say to them , “ ‘ The Lord will roar against his own landfrom his holy dwelling in heaven.He will shout like those who tread grapes ; he will shout against everyone on earth .
24:25:031:0	His cry of judgment will reach the ends of the earth , for the Lord will bring his case against all the nations.He will judge all the people of the earth , slaughtering the wicked with the sword.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ' ”
24:25:032:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ Look ! Disaster will fall upon nation after nation ! A great whirlwind of fury is risingfrom the most distant corners of the earth ! ”
24:25:033:0	In that day those the Lord has slaughtered will fill the earth from one end to the other . No one will mourn for them or gather up their bodies to bury them . They will be scattered on the ground like manure .
24:25:034:0	Weep and moan , you evil shepherds ! Roll in the dust , you leaders of the flock ! The time of your slaughter has arrived ; you will fall and shatter like a fragile vase .
24:25:035:0	You will find no place to hide ; there will be no way to escape .
24:25:036:0	Listen to the frantic cries of the shepherds.The leaders of the flock are wailing in despair , for the Lord is ruining their pastures .
24:25:037:0	Peaceful meadows will be turned into a wastelandby the Lord 's fierce anger .
24:25:038:0	He has left his den like a strong lion seeking its prey , and their land will be made desolateby the sword of the enemyand the Lord 's fierce anger .
