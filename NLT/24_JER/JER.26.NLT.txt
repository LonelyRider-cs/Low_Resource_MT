24:26:001:1	Jeremiah 's Escape from Death
24:26:001:0	This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah , king of Judah .
24:26:002:0	“ This is what the Lord says : Stand in the courtyard in front of the Temple of the Lord , and make an announcement to the people who have come there to worship from all over Judah . Give them my entire message ; include every word .
24:26:003:0	Perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways . Then I will change my mind about the disaster I am ready to pour out on them because of their sins .
24:26:004:0	“ Say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord says : If you will not listen to me and obey my word I have given you ,
24:26:005:0	and if you will not listen to my servants , the prophets — for I sent them again and again to warn you , but you would not listen to them —
24:26:006:0	then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed Shiloh , the place where the Tabernacle was located . And I will make Jerusalem an object of cursing in every nation on earth . ' ”
24:26:007:0	The priests , the prophets , and all the people listened to Jeremiah as he spoke in front of the Lord 's Temple .
24:26:008:0	But when Jeremiah had finished his message , saying everything the Lord had told him to say , the priests and prophets and all the people at the Temple mobbed him . “ Kill him ! ” they shouted .
24:26:009:0	“ What right do you have to prophesy in the Lord 's name that this Temple will be destroyed like Shiloh ? What do you mean , saying that Jerusalem will be destroyed and left with no inhabitants ? ” And all the people threatened him as he stood in front of the Temple .
24:26:010:0	When the officials of Judah heard what was happening , they rushed over from the palace and sat down at the New Gate of the Temple to hold court .
24:26:011:0	The priests and prophets presented their accusations to the officials and the people . “ This man should die ! ” they said . “ You have heard with your own ears what a traitor he is , for he has prophesied against this city . ”
24:26:012:0	Then Jeremiah spoke to the officials and the people in his own defense . “ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this Temple and this city , ” he said . “ The Lord gave me every word that I have spoken .
24:26:013:0	But if you stop your sinning and begin to obey the Lord your God , he will change his mind about this disaster that he has announced against you .
24:26:014:0	As for me , I am in your hands — do with me as you think best .
24:26:015:0	But if you kill me , rest assured that you will be killing an innocent man ! The responsibility for such a deed will lie on you , on this city , and on every person living in it . For it is absolutely true that the Lord sent me to speak every word you have heard . ”
24:26:016:0	Then the officials and the people said to the priests and prophets , “ This man does not deserve the death sentence , for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God . ”
24:26:017:0	Then some of the wise old men stood and spoke to all the people assembled there .
24:26:018:0	They said , “ Remember when Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah . He told the people of Judah , ‘ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field ; Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins ! A thicket will grow on the heightswhere the Temple now stands . '
24:26:019:0	But did King Hezekiah and the people kill him for saying this ? No , they turned from their sins and worshiped the Lord . They begged him for mercy . Then the Lord changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had pronounced against them . So we are about to do ourselves great harm . ”
24:26:020:0	At this time Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim was also prophesying for the Lord . And he predicted the same terrible disaster against the city and nation as Jeremiah did .
24:26:021:0	When King Jehoiakim and the army officers and officials heard what he was saying , the king sent someone to kill him . But Uriah heard about the plan and escaped in fear to Egypt .
24:26:022:0	Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt along with several other men to capture Uriah .
24:26:023:0	They took him prisoner and brought him back to King Jehoiakim . The king then killed Uriah with a sword and had him buried in an unmarked grave .
24:26:024:0	Nevertheless , Ahikam son of Shaphan stood up for Jeremiah and persuaded the court not to turn him over to the mob to be killed .
