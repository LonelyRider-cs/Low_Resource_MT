24:15:001:1	Judah 's Inevitable Doom
24:15:001:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me pleading for these people , I would n't help them . Away with them ! Get them out of my sight !
24:15:002:0	And if they say to you , ‘ But where can we go ? ' tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ ‘ Those who are destined for death , to death ; those who are destined for war , to war ; those who are destined for famine , to famine ; those who are destined for captivity , to captivity . '
24:15:003:0	“ I will send four kinds of destroyers against them , ” says the Lord . “ I will send the sword to kill , the dogs to drag away , the vultures to devour , and the wild animals to finish up what is left .
24:15:004:0	Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , did in Jerusalem , I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth .
24:15:005:0	“ Who will feel sorry for you , Jerusalem ? Who will weep for you ? Who will even bother to ask how you are ?
24:15:006:0	You have abandoned meand turned your back on me , ” says the Lord. “ Therefore , I will raise my fist to destroy you.I am tired of always giving you another chance .
24:15:007:0	I will winnow you like grain at the gates of your citiesand take away the children you hold dear.I will destroy my own people , because they refuse to change their evil ways .
24:15:008:0	There will be more widowsthan the grains of sand on the seashore.At noontime I will bring a destroyeragainst the mothers of young men.I will cause anguish and terrorto come upon them suddenly .
24:15:002:1	Jeremiah 's Complaint
24:15:009:0	The mother of seven grows faint and gasps for breath ; her sun has gone down while it is still day.She sits childless now , disgraced and humiliated.And I will hand over those who are leftto be killed by the enemy.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:15:010:0	Then I said , “ What sorrow is mine , my mother.Oh , that I had died at birth ! I am hated everywhere I go.I am neither a lender who threatens to foreclosenor a borrower who refuses to pay — yet they all curse me . ”
24:15:011:0	The Lord replied , “ I will take care of you , Jeremiah.Your enemies will ask you to plead on their behalfin times of trouble and distress .
24:15:012:0	Can a man break a bar of iron from the north , or a bar of bronze ?
24:15:013:0	At no cost to them , I will hand over your wealth and treasuresas plunder to your enemies , for sin runs rampant in your land .
24:15:014:0	I will tell your enemies to take youas captives to a foreign land.For my anger blazes like a firethat will burn forever . ”
24:15:015:0	Then I said , “ Lord , you know what 's happening to me.Please step in and help me . Punish my persecutors ! Please give me time ; do n't let me die young.It 's for your sake that I am suffering .
24:15:016:0	When I discovered your words , I devoured them.They are my joy and my heart 's delight , for I bear your name , O Lord God of Heaven 's Armies .
24:15:017:0	I never joined the people in their merry feasts.I sat alone because your hand was on me.I was filled with indignation at their sins .
24:15:018:0	Why then does my suffering continue ? Why is my wound so incurable ? Your help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook , like a spring that has gone dry . ”
24:15:019:0	This is how the Lord responds : “ If you return to me , I will restore youso you can continue to serve me.If you speak good words rather than worthless ones , you will be my spokesman.You must influence them ; do not let them influence you !
24:15:020:0	They will fight against you like an attacking army , but I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze.They will not conquer you , for I am with you to protect and rescue you.I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:15:021:0	Yes , I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men.I will rescue you from their cruel hands . ”
