24:8:001:0	“ In that day , ” says the Lord , “ the enemy will break open the graves of the kings and officials of Judah , and the graves of the priests , prophets , and common people of Jerusalem .
24:8:002:0	They will spread out their bones on the ground before the sun , moon , and stars — the gods my people have loved , served , and worshiped . Their bones will not be gathered up again or buried but will be scattered on the ground like manure .
24:8:001:1	Deception by False Prophets
24:8:003:0	And the people of this evil nation who survive will wish to die rather than live where I will send them . I , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken !
24:8:004:0	“ Jeremiah , say to the people , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ ‘ When people fall down , do n't they get up again ? When they discover they 're on the wrong road , do n't they turn back ?
24:8:005:0	Then why do these people stay on their self-destructive path ? Why do the people of Jerusalem refuse to turn back ? They cling tightly to their liesand will not turn around .
24:8:006:0	I listen to their conversationsand do n't hear a word of truth.Is anyone sorry for doing wrong ? Does anyone say , “ What a terrible thing I have done ” ? No ! All are running down the path of sinas swiftly as a horse galloping into battle !
24:8:007:0	Even the stork that flies across the skyknows the time of her migration , as do the turtledove , the swallow , and the crane.They all return at the proper time each year.But not my people ! They do not know the Lord 's laws .
24:8:008:0	“ ‘ How can you say , “ We are wise because we have the word of the Lord , ” when your teachers have twisted it by writing lies ?
24:8:009:0	These wise teachers will fallinto the trap of their own foolishness , for they have rejected the word of the Lord.Are they so wise after all ?
24:8:010:0	I will give their wives to othersand their farms to strangers.From the least to the greatest , their lives are ruled by greed.Yes , even my prophets and priests are like that.They are all frauds .
24:8:011:0	They offer superficial treatmentsfor my people 's mortal wound.They give assurances of peacewhen there is no peace .
24:8:012:0	Are they ashamed of these disgusting actions ? Not at all — they do n't even know how to blush ! Therefore , they will lie among the slaughtered.They will be brought down when I punish them , says the Lord .
24:8:013:0	I will surely consume them.There will be no more harvests of figs and grapes.Their fruit trees will all die.Whatever I gave them will soon be gone.I , the Lord , have spoken ! '
24:8:014:0	“ Then the people will say , ‘ Why should we wait here to die ? Come , let 's go to the fortified towns and die there.For the Lord our God has decreed our destructionand has given us a cup of poison to drinkbecause we sinned against the Lord .
24:8:015:0	We hoped for peace , but no peace came.We hoped for a time of healing , but found only terror . '
24:8:016:0	“ The snorting of the enemies ' warhorses can be heardall the way from the land of Dan in the north ! The neighing of their stallions makes the whole land tremble.They are coming to devour the land and everything in it — cities and people alike .
24:8:002:1	Jeremiah Weeps for Sinful Judah
24:8:017:0	I will send these enemy troops among youlike poisonous snakes you can not charm.They will bite you , and you will die.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:8:018:0	My grief is beyond healing ; my heart is broken .
24:8:019:0	Listen to the weeping of my people ; it can be heard all across the land. “ Has the Lord abandoned Jerusalem ? ” the people ask. “ Is her King no longer there ? ” “ Oh , why have they provoked my anger with their carved idolsand their worthless foreign gods ? ” says the Lord .
24:8:020:0	“ The harvest is finished , and the summer is gone , ” the people cry , “ yet we are not saved ! ”
24:8:021:0	I hurt with the hurt of my people.I mourn and am overcome with grief .
24:8:022:0	Is there no medicine in Gilead ? Is there no physician there ? Why is there no healingfor the wounds of my people ?
