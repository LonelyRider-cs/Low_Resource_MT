24:1:001:0	These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah , one of the priests from the town of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin .
24:1:002:0	The Lord first gave messages to Jeremiah during the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon , king of Judah .
24:1:001:1	Jeremiah 's Call and First Visions
24:1:003:0	The Lord 's messages continued throughout the reign of King Jehoiakim , Josiah 's son , until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah , another of Josiah 's sons . In August of that eleventh year the people of Jerusalem were taken away as captives .
24:1:004:0	The Lord gave me this message :
24:1:005:0	“ I knew you before I formed you in your mother 's womb.Before you were born I set you apartand appointed you as my prophet to the nations . ”
24:1:006:0	“ O Sovereign Lord , ” I said , “ I ca n't speak for you ! I 'm too young ! ”
24:1:007:0	The Lord replied , “ Do n't say , ‘ I 'm too young , ' for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you .
24:1:008:0	And do n't be afraid of the people , for I will be with you and will protect you . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:1:009:0	Then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth and said , “ Look , I have put my words in your mouth !
24:1:010:0	Today I appoint you to stand upagainst nations and kingdoms.Some you must uproot and tear down , destroy and overthrow.Others you must build upand plant . ”
24:1:011:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Look , Jeremiah ! What do you see ? ” And I replied , “ I see a branch from an almond tree . ”
24:1:012:0	And the Lord said , “ That 's right , and it means that I am watching , and I will certainly carry out all my plans . ”
24:1:013:0	Then the Lord spoke to me again and asked , “ What do you see now ? ” And I replied , “ I see a pot of boiling water , spilling from the north . ”
24:1:014:0	“ Yes , ” the Lord said , “ for terror from the north will boil out on the people of this land .
24:1:015:0	Listen ! I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to Jerusalem . I , the Lord , have spoken ! “ They will set their thronesat the gates of the city.They will attack its wallsand all the other towns of Judah .
24:1:016:0	I will pronounce judgmenton my people for all their evil—for deserting me and burning incense to other gods.Yes , they worship idols made with their own hands !
24:1:017:0	“ Get up and prepare for action.Go out and tell them everything I tell you to say.Do not be afraid of them , or I will make you look foolish in front of them .
24:1:018:0	For see , today I have made you stronglike a fortified city that can not be captured , like an iron pillar or a bronze wall.You will stand against the whole land—the kings , officials , priests , and people of Judah .
24:1:019:0	They will fight you , but they will fail.For I am with you , and I will take care of you.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
