24:30:001:1	Promises of Deliverance
24:30:001:0	The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah . He said ,
24:30:002:0	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Write down for the record everything I have said to you , Jeremiah .
24:30:003:0	For the time is coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people of Israel and Judah . I will bring them home to this land that I gave to their ancestors , and they will possess it again . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:30:004:0	This is the message the Lord gave concerning Israel and Judah .
24:30:005:0	This is what the Lord says : “ I hear cries of fear ; there is terror and no peace .
24:30:006:0	Now let me ask you a question : Do men give birth to babies ? Then why do they stand there , ashen-faced , hands pressed against their sideslike a woman in labor ?
24:30:007:0	In all history there has never been such a time of terror.It will be a time of trouble for my people Israel.Yet in the end they will be saved !
24:30:008:0	For in that day , ” says the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , “ I will break the yoke from their necksand snap their chains.Foreigners will no longer be their masters .
24:30:009:0	For my people will serve the Lord their Godand their king descended from David—the king I will raise up for them .
24:30:010:0	“ So do not be afraid , Jacob , my servant ; do not be dismayed , Israel , ” says the Lord. “ For I will bring you home again from distant lands , and your children will return from their exile.Israel will return to a life of peace and quiet , and no one will terrorize them .
24:30:011:0	For I am with you and will save you , ” says the Lord. “ I will completely destroy the nations where I have scattered you , but I will not completely destroy you.I will discipline you , but with justice ; I can not let you go unpunished . ”
24:30:012:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Your injury is incurable—a terrible wound .
24:30:013:0	There is no one to help youor to bind up your injury.No medicine can heal you .
24:30:014:0	All your lovers—your allies—have left youand do not care about you anymore.I have wounded you cruelly , as though I were your enemy.For your sins are many , and your guilt is great .
24:30:015:0	Why do you protest your punishment—this wound that has no cure ? I have had to punish youbecause your sins are manyand your guilt is great .
24:30:016:0	“ But all who devour you will be devoured , and all your enemies will be sent into exile.All who plunder you will be plundered , and all who attack you will be attacked .
24:30:017:0	I will give you back your healthand heal your wounds , ” says the Lord. “ For you are called an outcast— ‘ Jerusalem for whom no one cares . ' ”
24:30:018:0	This is what the Lord says : “ When I bring Israel home again from captivityand restore their fortunes , Jerusalem will be rebuilt on its ruins , and the palace reconstructed as before .
24:30:019:0	There will be joy and songs of thanksgiving , and I will multiply my people , not diminish them ; I will honor them , not despise them .
24:30:020:0	Their children will prosper as they did long ago.I will establish them as a nation before me , and I will punish anyone who hurts them .
24:30:021:0	They will have their own ruler again , and he will come from their own people.I will invite him to approach me , ” says the Lord , “ for who would dare to come unless invited ?
24:30:022:0	You will be my people , and I will be your God . ”
24:30:023:0	Look ! The Lord 's anger bursts out like a storm , a driving wind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked .
24:30:024:0	The fierce anger of the Lord will not diminishuntil it has finished all he has planned.In the days to comeyou will understand all this .
