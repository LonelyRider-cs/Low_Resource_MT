24:2:001:1	The
24:2:002:1	Lord
24:2:003:1	's Case against His People
24:2:001:0	The Lord gave me another message . He said ,
24:2:002:0	“ Go and shout this message to Jerusalem . This is what the Lord says : “ I remember how eager you were to please meas a young bride long ago , how you loved me and followed meeven through the barren wilderness .
24:2:003:0	In those days Israel was holy to the Lord , the first of his children.All who harmed his people were declared guilty , and disaster fell on them.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:2:004:0	Listen to the word of the Lord , people of Jacob—all you families of Israel !
24:2:005:0	This is what the Lord says : “ What did your ancestors find wrong with methat led them to stray so far from me ? They worshiped worthless idols , only to become worthless themselves .
24:2:006:0	They did not ask , ‘ Where is the Lordwho brought us safely out of Egyptand led us through the barren wilderness—a land of deserts and pits , a land of drought and death , where no one lives or even travels ? '
24:2:007:0	“ And when I brought you into a fruitful landto enjoy its bounty and goodness , you defiled my land andcorrupted the possession I had promised you .
24:2:008:0	The priests did not ask , ‘ Where is the Lord ? 'Those who taught my word ignored me , the rulers turned against me , and the prophets spoke in the name of Baal , wasting their time on worthless idols .
24:2:009:0	Therefore , I will bring my case against you , ” says the Lord. “ I will even bring charges against your children 's childrenin the years to come .
24:2:010:0	“ Go west and look in the land of Cyprus ; go east and search through the land of Kedar.Has anyone ever heard of anythingas strange as this ?
24:2:011:0	Has any nation ever traded its gods for new ones , even though they are not gods at all ? Yet my people have exchanged their glorious Godfor worthless idols !
24:2:012:0	The heavens are shocked at such a thingand shrink back in horror and dismay , ” says the Lord .
24:2:004:1	The Results of Israel 's Sin
24:2:013:0	“ For my people have done two evil things : They have abandoned me—the fountain of living water.And they have dug for themselves cracked cisternsthat can hold no water at all !
24:2:014:0	“ Why has Israel become a slave ? Why has he been carried away as plunder ?
24:2:015:0	Strong lions have roared against him , and the land has been destroyed.The towns are now in ruins , and no one lives in them anymore .
24:2:016:0	Egyptians , marching from their cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes , have destroyed Israel 's glory and power .
24:2:017:0	And you have brought this upon yourselvesby rebelling against the Lord your God , even though he was leading you on the way !
24:2:018:0	“ What have you gained by your alliances with Egyptand your covenants with Assyria ? What good to you are the streams of the Nileor the waters of the Euphrates River ?
24:2:019:0	Your wickedness will bring its own punishment.Your turning from me will shame you.You will see what an evil , bitter thing it isto abandon the Lord your God and not to fear him.I , the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , have spoken !
24:2:020:0	“ Long ago I broke the yoke that oppressed youand tore away the chains of your slavery , but still you said , ‘ I will not serve you . 'On every hill and under every green tree , you have prostituted yourselves by bowing down to idols .
24:2:021:0	But I was the one who planted you , choosing a vine of the purest stock—the very best.How did you grow into this corrupt wild vine ?
24:2:005:1	Israel , an Unfaithful Wife
24:2:022:0	No amount of soap or lye can make you clean.I still see the stain of your guilt.I , the Sovereign Lord , have spoken !
24:2:023:0	“ You say , ‘ That 's not true ! I have n't worshiped the images of Baal ! 'But how can you say that ? Go and look in any valley in the land ! Face the awful sins you have done.You are like a restless female cameldesperately searching for a mate .
24:2:024:0	You are like a wild donkey , sniffing the wind at mating time.Who can restrain her lust ? Those who desire her do n't need to search , for she goes running to them !
24:2:025:0	When will you stop running ? When will you stop panting after other gods ? But you say , ‘ Save your breath.I 'm in love with these foreign gods , and I ca n't stop loving them now ! '
24:2:026:0	“ Israel is like a thiefwho feels shame only when he gets caught.They , their kings , officials , priests , and prophets—all are alike in this .
24:2:027:0	To an image carved from a piece of wood they say , ‘ You are my father . 'To an idol chiseled from a block of stone they say , ‘ You are my mother . 'They turn their backs on me , but in times of trouble they cry out to me , ‘ Come and save us ! '
24:2:028:0	But why not call on these gods you have made ? When trouble comes , let them save you if they can ! For you have as many godsas there are towns in Judah .
24:2:029:0	Why do you accuse me of doing wrong ? You are the ones who have rebelled , ” says the Lord .
24:2:030:0	“ I have punished your children , but they did not respond to my discipline.You yourselves have killed your prophetsas a lion kills its prey .
24:2:031:0	“ O my people , listen to the words of the Lord ! Have I been like a desert to Israel ? Have I been to them a land of darkness ? Why then do my people say , ‘ At last we are free from God ! We do n't need him anymore ! '
24:2:032:0	Does a young woman forget her jewelry , or a bride her wedding dress ? Yet for years on endmy people have forgotten me .
24:2:033:0	“ How you plot and scheme to win your lovers.Even an experienced prostitute could learn from you !
24:2:034:0	Your clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor , though you did n't catch them breaking into your houses !
24:2:035:0	And yet you say , ‘ I have done nothing wrong.Surely God is n't angry with me ! 'But now I will punish you severelybecause you claim you have not sinned .
24:2:036:0	First here , then there—you flit from one ally to another asking for help.But your new friends in Egypt will let you down , just as Assyria did before .
24:2:037:0	In despair , you will be led into exilewith your hands on your heads , for the Lord has rejected the nations you trust.They will not help you at all .
