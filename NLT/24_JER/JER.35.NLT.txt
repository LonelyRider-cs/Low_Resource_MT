24:35:001:1	The Faithful Recabites
24:35:001:0	This is the message the Lord gave Jeremiah when Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah :
24:35:002:0	“ Go to the settlement where the families of the Recabites live , and invite them to the Lord 's Temple . Take them into one of the inner rooms , and offer them some wine . ”
24:35:003:0	So I went to see Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah and grandson of Habazziniah and all his brothers and sons—representing all the Recabite families .
24:35:004:0	I took them to the Temple , and we went into the room assigned to the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah , a man of God . This room was located next to the one used by the Temple officials , directly above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum , the Temple gatekeeper .
24:35:005:0	I set cups and jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink ,
24:35:006:0	but they refused . “ No , ” they said , “ we do n't drink wine , because our ancestor Jehonadab son of Recab gave us this command : ‘ You and your descendants must never drink wine .
24:35:007:0	And do not build houses or plant crops or vineyards , but always live in tents . If you follow these commands , you will live long , good lives in the land . '
24:35:008:0	So we have obeyed him in all these things . We have never had a drink of wine to this day , nor have our wives , our sons , or our daughters .
24:35:009:0	We have n't built houses or owned vineyards or farms or planted crops .
24:35:010:0	We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed all the commands of Jehonadab , our ancestor .
24:35:011:0	But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked this country , we were afraid of the Babylonian and Syrian armies . So we decided to move to Jerusalem . That is why we are here . ”
24:35:012:0	Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
24:35:013:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : Go and say to the people in Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ Come and learn a lesson about how to obey me .
24:35:014:0	The Recabites do not drink wine to this day because their ancestor Jehonadab told them not to . But I have spoken to you again and again , and you refuse to obey me .
24:35:015:0	Time after time I sent you prophets , who told you , “ Turn from your wicked ways , and start doing things right . Stop worshiping other gods so that you might live in peace here in the land I have given to you and your ancestors. ” But you would not listen to me or obey me .
24:35:016:0	The descendants of Jehonadab son of Recab have obeyed their ancestor completely , but you have refused to listen to me . '
24:35:017:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Because you refuse to listen or answer when I call , I will send upon Judah and Jerusalem all the disasters I have threatened . ' ”
24:35:018:0	Then Jeremiah turned to the Recabites and said , “ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You have obeyed your ancestor Jehonadab in every respect , following all his instructions . '
24:35:019:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Jehonadab son of Recab will always have descendants who serve me . ' ”
