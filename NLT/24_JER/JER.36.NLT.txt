24:36:001:1	Baruch Reads the
24:36:002:1	Lord
24:36:003:1	's Messages
24:36:001:0	During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king in Judah , the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
24:36:002:0	“ Get a scroll , and write down all my messages against Israel , Judah , and the other nations . Begin with the first message back in the days of Josiah , and write down every message , right up to the present time .
24:36:003:0	Perhaps the people of Judah will repent when they hear again all the terrible things I have planned for them . Then I will be able to forgive their sins and wrongdoings . ”
24:36:004:0	So Jeremiah sent for Baruch son of Neriah , and as Jeremiah dictated all the prophecies that the Lord had given him , Baruch wrote them on a scroll .
24:36:005:0	Then Jeremiah said to Baruch , “ I am a prisoner here and unable to go to the Temple .
24:36:006:0	So you go to the Temple on the next day of fasting , and read the messages from the Lord that I have had you write on this scroll . Read them so the people who are there from all over Judah will hear them .
24:36:007:0	Perhaps even yet they will turn from their evil ways and ask the Lord 's forgiveness before it is too late . For the Lord has threatened them with his terrible anger . ”
24:36:008:0	Baruch did as Jeremiah told him and read these messages from the Lord to the people at the Temple .
24:36:009:0	He did this on a day of sacred fasting held in late autumn , during the fifth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah . People from all over Judah had come to Jerusalem to attend the services at the Temple on that day .
24:36:010:0	Baruch read Jeremiah 's words on the scroll to all the people . He stood in front of the Temple room of Gemariah , son of Shaphan the secretary . This room was just off the upper courtyard of the Temple , near the New Gate entrance .
24:36:011:0	When Micaiah son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan heard the messages from the Lord ,
24:36:012:0	he went down to the secretary 's room in the palace where the administrative officials were meeting . Elishama the secretary was there , along with Delaiah son of Shemaiah , Elnathan son of Acbor , Gemariah son of Shaphan , Zedekiah son of Hananiah , and all the other officials .
24:36:013:0	When Micaiah told them about the messages Baruch was reading to the people ,
24:36:014:0	the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah , grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi , to ask Baruch to come and read the messages to them , too . So Baruch took the scroll and went to them .
24:36:015:0	“ Sit down and read the scroll to us , ” the officials said , and Baruch did as they requested .
24:36:016:0	When they heard all the messages , they looked at one another in alarm . “ We must tell the king what we have heard , ” they said to Baruch .
24:36:017:0	“ But first , tell us how you got these messages . Did they come directly from Jeremiah ? ”
24:36:018:0	So Baruch explained , “ Jeremiah dictated them , and I wrote them down in ink , word for word , on this scroll . ”
24:36:019:0	“ You and Jeremiah should both hide , ” the officials told Baruch . “ Do n't tell anyone where you are ! ”
24:36:004:1	King Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll
24:36:020:0	Then the officials left the scroll for safekeeping in the room of Elishama the secretary and went to tell the king what had happened .
24:36:021:0	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll . Jehudi brought it from Elishama 's room and read it to the king as all his officials stood by .
24:36:022:0	It was late autumn , and the king was in a winterized part of the palace , sitting in front of a fire to keep warm .
24:36:023:0	Each time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns , the king took a knife and cut off that section of the scroll . He then threw it into the fire , section by section , until the whole scroll was burned up .
24:36:024:0	Neither the king nor his attendants showed any signs of fear or repentance at what they heard .
24:36:025:0	Even when Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll , he would n't listen .
24:36:005:1	Jeremiah Rewrites the Scroll
24:36:026:0	Then the king commanded his son Jerahmeel , Seraiah son of Azriel , and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah . But the Lord had hidden them .
24:36:027:0	After the king had burned the scroll on which Baruch had written Jeremiah 's words , the Lord gave Jeremiah another message . He said ,
24:36:028:0	“ Get another scroll , and write everything again just as you did on the scroll King Jehoiakim burned .
24:36:029:0	Then say to the king , ‘ This is what the Lord says : You burned the scroll because it said the king of Babylon would destroy this land and empty it of people and animals .
24:36:030:0	Now this is what the Lord says about King Jehoiakim of Judah : He will have no heirs to sit on the throne of David . His dead body will be thrown out to lie unburied — exposed to the heat of the day and the frost of the night .
24:36:031:0	I will punish him and his family and his attendants for their sins . I will pour out on them and on all the people of Jerusalem and Judah all the disasters I promised , for they would not listen to my warnings . ' ”
24:36:032:0	So Jeremiah took another scroll and dictated again to his secretary , Baruch . He wrote everything that had been on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned in the fire . Only this time he added much more !
