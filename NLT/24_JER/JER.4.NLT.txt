24:4:001:0	“ O Israel , ” says the Lord , “ if you wanted to return to me , you could.You could throw away your detestable idolsand stray away no more .
24:4:001:1	Coming Judgment against Judah
24:4:002:0	Then when you swear by my name , saying , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , 'you could do sowith truth , justice , and righteousness.Then you would be a blessing to the nations of the world , and all people would come and praise my name . ”
24:4:003:0	This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem : “ Plow up the hard ground of your hearts ! Do not waste your good seed among thorns .
24:4:004:0	O people of Judah and Jerusalem , surrender your pride and power.Change your hearts before the Lord , or my anger will burn like an unquenchable firebecause of all your sins .
24:4:005:0	“ Shout to Judah , and broadcast to Jerusalem ! Tell them to sound the alarm throughout the land : ‘ Run for your lives ! Flee to the fortified cities ! '
24:4:006:0	Raise a signal flag as a warning for Jerusalem : ‘ Flee now ! Do not delay ! 'For I am bringing terrible destruction upon youfrom the north . ”
24:4:007:0	A lion stalks from its den , a destroyer of nations.It has left its lair and is headed your way.It 's going to devastate your land ! Your towns will lie in ruins , with no one living in them anymore .
24:4:008:0	So put on clothes of mourningand weep with broken hearts , for the fierce anger of the Lordis still upon us .
24:4:009:0	“ In that day , ” says the Lord , “ the king and the officials will tremble in fear.The priests will be struck with horror , and the prophets will be appalled . ”
24:4:010:0	Then I said , “ O Sovereign Lord , the people have been deceived by what you said , for you promised peace for Jerusalem.But the sword is held at their throats ! ”
24:4:011:0	The time is coming when the Lord will sayto the people of Jerusalem , “ My dear people , a burning wind is blowing in from the desert , and it 's not a gentle breeze useful for winnowing grain .
24:4:012:0	It is a roaring blast sent by me ! Now I will pronounce your destruction ! ”
24:4:013:0	Our enemy rushes down on us like storm clouds ! His chariots are like whirlwinds.His horses are swifter than eagles.How terrible it will be , for we are doomed !
24:4:014:0	O Jerusalem , cleanse your heartthat you may be saved.How long will you harboryour evil thoughts ?
24:4:015:0	Your destruction has been announcedfrom Dan and the hill country of Ephraim .
24:4:016:0	“ Warn the surrounding nationsand announce this to Jerusalem : The enemy is coming from a distant land , raising a battle cry against the towns of Judah .
24:4:017:0	They surround Jerusalem like watchmen around a field , for my people have rebelled against me , ” says the Lord .
24:4:002:1	Jeremiah Weeps for His People
24:4:018:0	“ Your own actions have brought this upon you.This punishment is bitter , piercing you to the heart ! ”
24:4:019:0	My heart , my heart—I writhe in pain ! My heart pounds within me ! I can not be still.For I have heard the blast of enemy trumpetsand the roar of their battle cries .
24:4:020:0	Waves of destruction roll over the land , until it lies in complete desolation.Suddenly my tents are destroyed ; in a moment my shelters are crushed .
24:4:021:0	How long must I see the battle flagsand hear the trumpets of war ?
24:4:003:1	Jeremiah 's Vision of Coming Disaster
24:4:022:0	“ My people are foolishand do not know me , ” says the Lord. “ They are stupid childrenwho have no understanding.They are clever enough at doing wrong , but they have no idea how to do right ! ”
24:4:023:0	I looked at the earth , and it was empty and formless.I looked at the heavens , and there was no light .
24:4:024:0	I looked at the mountains and hills , and they trembled and shook .
24:4:025:0	I looked , and all the people were gone.All the birds of the sky had flown away .
24:4:026:0	I looked , and the fertile fields had become a wilderness.The towns lay in ruins , crushed by the Lord 's fierce anger .
24:4:027:0	This is what the Lord says : “ The whole land will be ruined , but I will not destroy it completely .
24:4:028:0	The earth will mournand the heavens will be draped in blackbecause of my decree against my people.I have made up my mind and will not change it . ”
24:4:029:0	At the noise of charioteers and archers , the people flee in terror.They hide in the bushesand run for the mountains.All the towns have been abandoned—not a person remains !
24:4:030:0	What are you doing , you who have been plundered ? Why do you dress up in beautiful clothingand put on gold jewelry ? Why do you brighten your eyes with mascara ? Your primping will do you no good ! The allies who were your loversdespise you and seek to kill you .
24:4:031:0	I hear a cry , like that of a woman in labor , the groans of a woman giving birth to her first child.It is beautiful Jerusalemgasping for breath and crying out , “ Help ! I 'm being murdered ! ”
