24:46:002:1	Messages about Egypt
24:46:001:0	The following messages were given to Jeremiah the prophet from the Lord concerning foreign nations .
24:46:002:0	This message concerning Egypt was given in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah , the king of Judah , on the occasion of the battle of Carchemish when Pharaoh Neco , king of Egypt , and his army were defeated beside the Euphrates River by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon .
24:46:003:0	“ Prepare your shields , and advance into battle !
24:46:004:0	Harness the horses , and mount the stallions.Take your positions.Put on your helmets.Sharpen your spears , and prepare your armor .
24:46:005:0	But what do I see ? The Egyptian army flees in terror.The bravest of its fighting men runwithout a backward glance.They are terrorized at every turn , ” says the Lord .
24:46:006:0	“ The swiftest runners can not flee ; the mightiest warriors can not escape.By the Euphrates River to the north , they stumble and fall .
24:46:007:0	“ Who is this , rising like the Nile at floodtime , overflowing all the land ?
24:46:008:0	It is the Egyptian army , overflowing all the land , boasting that it will cover the earth like a flood , destroying cities and their people .
24:46:009:0	Charge , you horses and chariots ; attack , you mighty warriors of Egypt ! Come , all you allies from Ethiopia , Libya , and Lydiawho are skilled with the shield and bow !
24:46:010:0	For this is the day of the Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , a day of vengeance on his enemies.The sword will devour until it is satisfied , yes , until it is drunk with your blood ! The Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , will receive a sacrifice todayin the north country beside the Euphrates River .
24:46:011:0	“ Go up to Gilead to get medicine , O virgin daughter of Egypt ! But your many treatmentswill bring you no healing .
24:46:012:0	The nations have heard of your shame.The earth is filled with your cries of despair.Your mightiest warriors will run into each otherand fall down together . ”
24:46:013:0	Then the Lord gave the prophet Jeremiah this message about King Nebuchadnezzar 's plans to attack Egypt .
24:46:014:0	“ Shout it out in Egypt ! Publish it in the cities of Migdol , Memphis , and Tahpanhes ! Mobilize for battle , for the sword will devour everyone around you .
24:46:015:0	Why have your warriors fallen ? They can not stand , for the Lord has knocked them down .
24:46:016:0	They stumble and fall over each otherand say among themselves , ‘ Come , let 's go back to our people , to the land of our birth.Let 's get away from the sword of the enemy ! '
24:46:017:0	There they will say , ‘ Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , is a loudmouthwho missed his opportunity ! '
24:46:018:0	“ As surely as I live , ” says the King , whose name is the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , “ one is coming against Egyptwho is as tall as Mount Tabor , or as Mount Carmel by the sea !
24:46:019:0	Pack up ! Get ready to leave for exile , you citizens of Egypt ! The city of Memphis will be destroyed , without a single inhabitant .
24:46:020:0	Egypt is as sleek as a beautiful heifer , but a horsefly from the north is on its way !
24:46:021:0	Egypt 's mercenaries have become like fattened calves.They , too , will turn and run , for it is a day of great disaster for Egypt , a time of great punishment .
24:46:022:0	Egypt flees , silent as a serpent gliding away.The invading army marches in ; they come against her with axes like woodsmen .
24:46:023:0	They will cut down her people like trees , ” says the Lord , “ for they are more numerous than locusts .
24:46:024:0	Egypt will be humiliated ; she will be handed over to people from the north . ”
24:46:025:0	The Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : “ I will punish Amon , the god of Thebes , and all the other gods of Egypt . I will punish its rulers and Pharaoh , too , and all who trust in him .
24:46:026:0	I will hand them over to those who want them killed — to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his army . But afterward the land will recover from the ravages of war . I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:46:027:0	“ But do not be afraid , Jacob , my servant ; do not be dismayed , Israel.For I will bring you home again from distant lands , and your children will return from their exile.Israel will return to a life of peace and quiet , and no one will terrorize them .
24:46:028:0	Do not be afraid , Jacob , my servant , for I am with you , ” says the Lord. “ I will completely destroy the nations to which I have exiled you , but I will not completely destroy you.I will discipline you , but with justice ; I can not let you go unpunished . ”
