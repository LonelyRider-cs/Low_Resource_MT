24:31:001:1	Hope for Restoration
24:31:001:0	“ In that day , ” says the Lord , “ I will be the God of all the families of Israel , and they will be my people .
24:31:002:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Those who survive the coming destructionwill find blessings even in the barren land , for I will give rest to the people of Israel . ”
24:31:003:0	Long ago the Lord said to Israel : “ I have loved you , my people , with an everlasting love.With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself .
24:31:004:0	I will rebuild you , my virgin Israel.You will again be happyand dance merrily with your tambourines .
24:31:005:0	Again you will plant your vineyards on the mountains of Samariaand eat from your own gardens there .
24:31:006:0	The day will come when watchmen will shoutfrom the hill country of Ephraim , ‘ Come , let us go up to Jerusalemto worship the Lord our God . ' ”
24:31:007:0	Now this is what the Lord says : “ Sing with joy for Israel.Shout for the greatest of nations ! Shout out with praise and joy : ‘ Save your people , O Lord , the remnant of Israel ! '
24:31:008:0	For I will bring them from the northand from the distant corners of the earth.I will not forget the blind and lame , the expectant mothers and women in labor.A great company will return !
24:31:009:0	Tears of joy will stream down their faces , and I will lead them home with great care.They will walk beside quiet streamsand on smooth paths where they will not stumble.For I am Israel 's father , and Ephraim is my oldest child .
24:31:010:0	“ Listen to this message from the Lord , you nations of the world ; proclaim it in distant coastlands : The Lord , who scattered his people , will gather them and watch over themas a shepherd does his flock .
24:31:011:0	For the Lord has redeemed Israelfrom those too strong for them .
24:31:012:0	They will come home and sing songs of joy on the heights of Jerusalem.They will be radiant because of the Lord 's good gifts — the abundant crops of grain , new wine , and olive oil , and the healthy flocks and herds.Their life will be like a watered garden , and all their sorrows will be gone .
24:31:013:0	The young women will dance for joy , and the men — old and young — will join in the celebration.I will turn their mourning into joy.I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing .
24:31:002:1	Rachel 's Sadness Turns to Joy
24:31:014:0	The priests will enjoy abundance , and my people will feast on my good gifts.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:31:015:0	This is what the Lord says : “ A cry is heard in Ramah — deep anguish and bitter weeping.Rachel weeps for her children , refusing to be comforted — for her children are gone . ”
24:31:016:0	But now this is what the Lord says : “ Do not weep any longer , for I will reward you , ” says the Lord. “ Your children will come back to youfrom the distant land of the enemy .
24:31:017:0	There is hope for your future , ” says the Lord. “ Your children will come again to their own land .
24:31:018:0	I have heard Israel saying , ‘ You disciplined me severely , like a calf that needs training for the yoke.Turn me again to you and restore me , for you alone are the Lord my God .
24:31:019:0	I turned away from God , but then I was sorry.I kicked myself for my stupidity ! I was thoroughly ashamed of all I did in my younger days . '
24:31:020:0	“ Is not Israel still my son , my darling child ? ” says the Lord. “ I often have to punish him , but I still love him.That 's why I long for himand surely will have mercy on him .
24:31:021:0	Set up road signs ; put up guideposts.Mark well the pathby which you came.Come back again , my virgin Israel ; return to your towns here .
24:31:022:0	How long will you wander , my wayward daughter ? For the Lord will cause something new to happen — Israel will embrace her God . ”
24:31:023:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : “ When I bring them back from captivity , the people of Judah and its towns will again say , ‘ The Lord bless you , O righteous home , O holy mountain ! '
24:31:024:0	Townspeople and farmers and shepherds alike will live together in peace and happiness .
24:31:025:0	For I have given rest to the weary and joy to the sorrowing . ”
24:31:026:0	At this , I woke up and looked around . My sleep had been very sweet .
24:31:027:0	“ The day is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when I will greatly increase the human population and the number of animals here in Israel and Judah .
24:31:028:0	In the past I deliberately uprooted and tore down this nation . I overthrew it , destroyed it , and brought disaster upon it . But in the future I will just as deliberately plant it and build it up . I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:31:029:0	“ The people will no longer quote this proverb : ‘ The parents have eaten sour grapes , but their children 's mouths pucker at the taste . '
24:31:030:0	All people will die for their own sins — those who eat the sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths will pucker .
24:31:031:0	“ The day is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah .
24:31:032:0	This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt . They broke that covenant , though I loved them as a husband loves his wife , ” says the Lord .
24:31:033:0	“ But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days , ” says the Lord . “ I will put my instructions deep within them , and I will write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
24:31:034:0	And they will not need to teach their neighbors , nor will they need to teach their relatives , saying , ‘ You should know the Lord . ' For everyone , from the least to the greatest , will know me already , ” says the Lord . “ And I will forgive their wickedness , and I will never again remember their sins . ”
24:31:035:0	It is the Lord who provides the sun to light the dayand the moon and stars to light the night , and who stirs the sea into roaring waves.His name is the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , and this is what he says :
24:31:036:0	“ I am as likely to reject my people Israelas I am to abolish the laws of nature ! ”
24:31:037:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Just as the heavens can not be measuredand the foundations of the earth can not be explored , so I will not consider casting them awayfor the evil they have done.I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:31:038:0	“ The day is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when all Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me , from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
24:31:039:0	A measuring line will be stretched out over the hill of Gareb and across to Goah .
24:31:040:0	And the entire area — including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley , and all the fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the Horse Gate — will be holy to the Lord . The city will never again be captured or destroyed . ”
