24:3:001:0	“ If a man divorces a womanand she goes and marries someone else , he will not take her back again , for that would surely corrupt the land.But you have prostituted yourself with many lovers , so why are you trying to come back to me ? ” says the Lord .
24:3:002:0	“ Look at the shrines on every hilltop.Is there any place you have not been defiledby your adultery with other gods ? You sit like a prostitute beside the road waiting for a customer.You sit alone like a nomad in the desert.You have polluted the land with your prostitutionand your wickedness .
24:3:003:0	That 's why even the spring rains have failed.For you are a brazen prostitute and completely shameless .
24:3:004:0	Yet you say to me , ‘ Father , you have been my guide since my youth .
24:3:001:1	Judah Follows Israel 's Example
24:3:005:0	Surely you wo n't be angry forever ! Surely you can forget about it ! 'So you talk , but you keep on doing all the evil you can . ”
24:3:006:0	During the reign of King Josiah , the Lord said to me , “ Have you seen what fickle Israel has done ? Like a wife who commits adultery , Israel has worshiped other gods on every hill and under every green tree .
24:3:007:0	I thought , ‘ After she has done all this , she will return to me . ' But she did not return , and her faithless sister Judah saw this .
24:3:008:0	She saw that I divorced faithless Israel because of her adultery . But that treacherous sister Judah had no fear , and now she , too , has left me and given herself to prostitution .
24:3:009:0	Israel treated it all so lightly—she thought nothing of committing adultery by worshiping idols made of wood and stone . So now the land has been polluted .
24:3:002:1	Hope for Wayward Israel
24:3:010:0	But despite all this , her faithless sister Judah has never sincerely returned to me . She has only pretended to be sorry . I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
24:3:011:0	Then the Lord said to me , “ Even faithless Israel is less guilty than treacherous Judah !
24:3:012:0	Therefore , go and give this message to Israel . This is what the Lord says : “ O Israel , my faithless people , come home to me again , for I am merciful.I will not be angry with you forever .
24:3:013:0	Only acknowledge your guilt.Admit that you rebelled against the Lord your Godand committed adultery against himby worshiping idols under every green tree.Confess that you refused to listen to my voice.I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:3:014:0	“ Return home , you wayward children , ” says the Lord , “ for I am your master.I will bring you back to the land of Israel—one from this town and two from that family—from wherever you are scattered .
24:3:015:0	And I will give you shepherds after my own heart , who will guide you with knowledge and understanding .
24:3:016:0	“ And when your land is once more filled with people , ” says the Lord , “ you will no longer wish for ‘ the good old days ' when you possessed the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant . You will not miss those days or even remember them , and there will be no need to rebuild the Ark .
24:3:017:0	In that day Jerusalem will be known as ‘ The Throne of the Lord . ' All nations will come there to honor the Lord . They will no longer stubbornly follow their own evil desires .
24:3:018:0	In those days the people of Judah and Israel will return together from exile in the north . They will return to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance forever .
24:3:019:0	“ I thought to myself , ‘ I would love to treat you as my own children ! ' I wanted nothing more than to give you this beautiful land—the finest possession in the world.I looked forward to your calling me ‘ Father , 'and I wanted you never to turn from me .
24:3:020:0	But you have been unfaithful to me , you people of Israel ! You have been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband.I , the Lord , have spoken . ”
24:3:021:0	Voices are heard high on the windswept mountains , the weeping and pleading of Israel 's people.For they have chosen crooked pathsand have forgotten the Lord their God .
24:3:022:0	“ My wayward children , ” says the Lord , “ come back to me , and I will heal your wayward hearts. ” “ Yes , we 're coming , ” the people reply , “ for you are the Lord our God .
24:3:023:0	Our worship of idols on the hillsand our religious orgies on the mountainsare a delusion.Only in the Lord our Godwill Israel ever find salvation .
24:3:024:0	From childhood we have watchedas everything our ancestors worked for—their flocks and herds , their sons and daughters—was squandered on a delusion .
24:3:025:0	Let us now lie down in shameand cover ourselves with dishonor , for we and our ancestors have sinnedagainst the Lord our God.From our childhood to this daywe have never obeyed him . ”
