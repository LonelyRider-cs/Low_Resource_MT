24:9:001:0	If only my head were a pool of waterand my eyes a fountain of tears , I would weep day and nightfor all my people who have been slaughtered .
24:9:001:1	Judgment for Disobedience
24:9:002:0	Oh , that I could go away and forget my peopleand live in a travelers ' shack in the desert.For they are all adulterers — a pack of treacherous liars .
24:9:003:0	“ My people bend their tongues like bowsto shoot out lies.They refuse to stand up for the truth.They only go from bad to worse.They do not know me , ” says the Lord .
24:9:004:0	“ Beware of your neighbor ! Do n't even trust your brother ! For brother takes advantage of brother , and friend slanders friend .
24:9:005:0	They all fool and defraud each other ; no one tells the truth.With practiced tongues they tell lies ; they wear themselves out with all their sinning .
24:9:006:0	They pile lie upon lieand utterly refuse to acknowledge me , ” says the Lord .
24:9:007:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ See , I will melt them down in a crucibleand test them like metal.What else can I do with my people ?
24:9:008:0	For their tongues shoot lies like poisoned arrows.They speak friendly words to their neighborswhile scheming in their heart to kill them .
24:9:009:0	Should I not punish them for this ? ” says the Lord. “ Should I not avenge myself against such a nation ? ”
24:9:010:0	I will weep for the mountainsand wail for the wilderness pastures.For they are desolate and empty of life ; the lowing of cattle is heard no more ; the birds and wild animals have all fled .
24:9:011:0	“ I will make Jerusalem into a heap of ruins , ” says the Lord. “ It will be a place haunted by jackals.The towns of Judah will be ghost towns , with no one living in them . ”
24:9:012:0	Who is wise enough to understand all this ? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it to others ? Why has the land been so ruined that no one dares to travel through it ?
24:9:013:0	The Lord replies , “ This has happened because my people have abandoned my instructions ; they have refused to obey what I said .
24:9:014:0	Instead , they have stubbornly followed their own desires and worshiped the images of Baal , as their ancestors taught them .
24:9:015:0	So now , this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : Look ! I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink .
24:9:002:1	Weeping in Jerusalem
24:9:016:0	I will scatter them around the world , in places they and their ancestors never heard of , and even there I will chase them with the sword until I have destroyed them completely . ”
24:9:017:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies says : “ Consider all this , and call for the mourners.Send for the women who mourn at funerals .
24:9:018:0	Quick ! Begin your weeping ! Let the tears flow from your eyes .
24:9:019:0	Hear the people of Jerusalem crying in despair , ‘ We are ruined ! We are completely humiliated ! We must leave our land , because our homes have been torn down . ' ”
24:9:020:0	Listen , you women , to the words of the Lord ; open your ears to what he has to say.Teach your daughters to wail ; teach one another how to lament .
24:9:021:0	For death has crept in through our windowsand has entered our mansions.It has killed off the flower of our youth : Children no longer play in the streets , and young men no longer gather in the squares .
24:9:022:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Bodies will be scattered across the fields like clumps of manure , like bundles of grain after the harvest.No one will be left to bury them . ”
24:9:023:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Do n't let the wise boast in their wisdom , or the powerful boast in their power , or the rich boast in their riches .
24:9:024:0	But those who wish to boastshould boast in this alone : that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lordwho demonstrates unfailing loveand who brings justice and righteousness to the earth , and that I delight in these things.I , the Lord , have spoken !
24:9:025:0	“ A time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when I will punish all those who are circumcised in body but not in spirit —
24:9:026:0	the Egyptians , Edomites , Ammonites , Moabites , the people who live in the desert in remote places , and yes , even the people of Judah . And like all these pagan nations , the people of Israel also have uncircumcised hearts . ”
