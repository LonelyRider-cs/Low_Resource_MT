24:5:001:1	The Sins of Judah
24:5:001:0	“ Run up and down every street in Jerusalem , ” says the Lord. “ Look high and low ; search throughout the city ! If you can find even one just and honest person , I will not destroy the city .
24:5:002:0	But even when they are under oath , saying , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , 'they are still telling lies ! ”
24:5:003:0	Lord , you are searching for honesty.You struck your people , but they paid no attention.You crushed them , but they refused to be corrected.They are determined , with faces set like stone ; they have refused to repent .
24:5:004:0	Then I said , “ But what can we expect from the poor ? They are ignorant.They do n't know the ways of the Lord.They do n't understand God 's laws .
24:5:005:0	So I will go and speak to their leaders.Surely they know the ways of the Lordand understand God 's laws. ” But the leaders , too , as one man , had thrown off God 's yokeand broken his chains .
24:5:006:0	So now a lion from the forest will attack them ; a wolf from the desert will pounce on them.A leopard will lurk near their towns , tearing apart any who dare to venture out.For their rebellion is great , and their sins are many .
24:5:007:0	“ How can I pardon you ? For even your children have turned from me.They have sworn by gods that are not gods at all ! I fed my people until they were full.But they thanked me by committing adulteryand lining up at the brothels .
24:5:008:0	They are well-fed , lusty stallions , each neighing for his neighbor 's wife .
24:5:009:0	Should I not punish them for this ? ” says the Lord. “ Should I not avenge myself against such a nation ?
24:5:010:0	“ Go down the rows of the vineyards and destroy the grapevines , leaving a scattered few alive.Strip the branches from the vines , for these people do not belong to the Lord .
24:5:011:0	The people of Israel and Judahare full of treachery against me , ” says the Lord .
24:5:012:0	“ They have lied about the Lordand said , ‘ He wo n't bother us ! No disasters will come upon us.There will be no war or famine .
24:5:013:0	God 's prophets are all windbagswho do n't really speak for him.Let their predictions of disaster fall on themselves ! ' ”
24:5:014:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies says : “ Because the people are talking like this , my messages will flame out of your mouthand burn the people like kindling wood .
24:5:015:0	O Israel , I will bring a distant nation against you , ” says the Lord. “ It is a mighty nation , an ancient nation , a people whose language you do not know , whose speech you can not understand .
24:5:016:0	Their weapons are deadly ; their warriors are mighty .
24:5:017:0	They will devour the food of your harvest ; they will devour your sons and daughters.They will devour your flocks and herds ; they will devour your grapes and figs.And they will destroy your fortified towns , which you think are so safe .
24:5:018:0	“ Yet even in those days I will not blot you out completely , ” says the Lord .
24:5:002:1	A Warning for God 's People
24:5:019:0	“ And when your people ask , ‘ Why did the Lord our God do all this to us ? ' you must reply , ‘ You rejected him and gave yourselves to foreign gods in your own land . Now you will serve foreigners in a land that is not your own . '
24:5:020:0	“ Make this announcement to Israel , and say this to Judah :
24:5:021:0	Listen , you foolish and senseless people , with eyes that do not seeand ears that do not hear .
24:5:022:0	Have you no respect for me ? Why do n't you tremble in my presence ? I , the Lord , define the ocean 's sandy shorelineas an everlasting boundary that the waters can not cross.The waves may toss and roar , but they can never pass the boundaries I set .
24:5:023:0	But my people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.They have turned away and abandoned me .
24:5:024:0	They do not say from the heart , ‘ Let us live in awe of the Lord our God , for he gives us rain each spring and fall , assuring us of a harvest when the time is right . '
24:5:025:0	Your wickedness has deprived you of these wonderful blessings.Your sin has robbed you of all these good things .
24:5:026:0	“ Among my people are wicked menwho lie in wait for victims like a hunter hiding in a blind.They continually set trapsto catch people .
24:5:027:0	Like a cage filled with birds , their homes are filled with evil plots.And now they are great and rich .
24:5:028:0	They are fat and sleek , and there is no limit to their wicked deeds.They refuse to provide justice to orphansand deny the rights of the poor .
24:5:029:0	Should I not punish them for this ? ” says the Lord. “ Should I not avenge myself against such a nation ?
24:5:030:0	A horrible and shocking thinghas happened in this land —
24:5:031:0	the prophets give false prophecies , and the priests rule with an iron hand.Worse yet , my people like it that way ! But what will you do when the end comes ?
