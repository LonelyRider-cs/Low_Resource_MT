24:38:001:1	Jeremiah in a Cistern
24:38:001:0	Now Shephatiah son of Mattan , Gedaliah son of Pashhur , Jehucal son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah had been telling the people . He had been saying ,
24:38:002:0	“ This is what the Lord says : ‘ Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war , famine , or disease , but those who surrender to the Babylonians will live . Their reward will be life . They will live ! '
24:38:003:0	The Lord also says : ‘ The city of Jerusalem will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon , who will capture it . ' ”
24:38:004:0	So these officials went to the king and said , “ Sir , this man must die ! That kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few fighting men we have left , as well as that of all the people . This man is a traitor ! ”
24:38:005:0	King Zedekiah agreed . “ All right , ” he said . “ Do as you like . I ca n't stop you . ”
24:38:006:0	So the officials took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into an empty cistern in the prison yard . It belonged to Malkijah , a member of the royal family . There was no water in the cistern , but there was a thick layer of mud at the bottom , and Jeremiah sank down into it .
24:38:007:0	But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , an important court official , heard that Jeremiah was in the cistern . At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate ,
24:38:008:0	so Ebed-melech rushed from the palace to speak with him .
24:38:009:0	“ My lord the king , ” he said , “ these men have done a very evil thing in putting Jeremiah the prophet into the cistern . He will soon die of hunger , for almost all the bread in the city is gone . ”
24:38:010:0	So the king told Ebed-melech , “ Take thirty of my men with you , and pull Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies . ”
24:38:011:0	So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to a room in the palace beneath the treasury , where he found some old rags and discarded clothing . He carried these to the cistern and lowered them to Jeremiah on a rope .
24:38:012:0	Ebed-melech called down to Jeremiah , “ Put these rags under your armpits to protect you from the ropes. ” Then when Jeremiah was ready ,
24:38:002:1	Zedekiah Questions Jeremiah
24:38:013:0	they pulled him out . So Jeremiah was returned to the courtyard of the guard — the palace prison — where he remained .
24:38:014:0	One day King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the third entrance of the Lord 's Temple . “ I want to ask you something , ” the king said . “ And do n't try to hide the truth . ”
24:38:015:0	Jeremiah said , “ If I tell you the truth , you will kill me . And if I give you advice , you wo n't listen to me anyway . ”
24:38:016:0	So King Zedekiah secretly promised him , “ As surely as the Lord our Creator lives , I will not kill you or hand you over to the men who want you dead . ”
24:38:017:0	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ This is what the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : ‘ If you surrender to the Babylonian officers , you and your family will live , and the city will not be burned down .
24:38:018:0	But if you refuse to surrender , you will not escape ! This city will be handed over to the Babylonians , and they will burn it to the ground . ' ”
24:38:019:0	“ But I am afraid to surrender , ” the king said , “ for the Babylonians may hand me over to the Judeans who have defected to them . And who knows what they will do to me ! ”
24:38:020:0	Jeremiah replied , “ You wo n't be handed over to them if you choose to obey the Lord . Your life will be spared , and all will go well for you .
24:38:021:0	But if you refuse to surrender , this is what the Lord has revealed to me :
24:38:022:0	All the women left in your palace will be brought out and given to the officers of the Babylonian army . Then the women will taunt you , saying , ‘ What fine friends you have ! They have betrayed and misled you.When your feet sank in the mud , they left you to your fate ! '
24:38:023:0	All your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians , and you will not escape . You will be seized by the king of Babylon , and this city will be burned down . ”
24:38:024:0	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ Do n't tell anyone you told me this , or you will die !
24:38:025:0	My officials may hear that I spoke to you , and they may say , ‘ Tell us what you and the king were talking about . If you do n't tell us , we will kill you . '
24:38:026:0	If this happens , just tell them you begged me not to send you back to Jonathan 's dungeon , for fear you would die there . ”
24:38:027:0	Sure enough , it was n't long before the king 's officials came to Jeremiah and asked him why the king had called for him . But Jeremiah followed the king 's instructions , and they left without finding out the truth . No one had overheard the conversation between Jeremiah and the king .
24:38:028:0	And Jeremiah remained a prisoner in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured .
