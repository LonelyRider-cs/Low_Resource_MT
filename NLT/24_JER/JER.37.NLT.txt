24:37:001:1	Zedekiah Calls for Jeremiah
24:37:001:0	Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim as the king of Judah . He was appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon .
24:37:002:0	But neither King Zedekiah nor his attendants nor the people who were left in the land listened to what the Lord said through Jeremiah .
24:37:003:0	Nevertheless , King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the priest , son of Maaseiah , to ask Jeremiah , “ Please pray to the Lord our God for us . ”
24:37:004:0	Jeremiah had not yet been imprisoned , so he could come and go among the people as he pleased .
24:37:005:0	At this time the army of Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt appeared at the southern border of Judah . When the Babylonian army heard about it , they withdrew from their siege of Jerusalem .
24:37:006:0	Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah :
24:37:007:0	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : The king of Judah sent you to ask me what is going to happen . Tell him , ‘ Pharaoh 's army is about to return to Egypt , though he came here to help you .
24:37:008:0	Then the Babylonians will come back and capture this city and burn it to the ground . '
24:37:009:0	“ This is what the Lord says : Do not fool yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians are gone for good . They are n't !
24:37:002:1	Jeremiah Is Imprisoned
24:37:010:0	Even if you were to destroy the entire Babylonian army , leaving only a handful of wounded survivors , they would still stagger from their tents and burn this city to the ground ! ”
24:37:011:0	When the Babylonian army left Jerusalem because of Pharaoh 's approaching army ,
24:37:012:0	Jeremiah started to leave the city on his way to the territory of Benjamin , to claim his share of the property among his relatives there .
24:37:013:0	But as he was walking through the Benjamin Gate , a sentry arrested him and said , “ You are defecting to the Babylonians ! ” The sentry making the arrest was Irijah son of Shelemiah , grandson of Hananiah .
24:37:014:0	“ That 's not true ! ” Jeremiah protested . “ I had no intention of doing any such thing. ” But Irijah would n't listen , and he took Jeremiah before the officials .
24:37:015:0	They were furious with Jeremiah and had him flogged and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary . Jonathan 's house had been converted into a prison .
24:37:016:0	Jeremiah was put into a dungeon cell , where he remained for many days .
24:37:017:0	Later King Zedekiah secretly requested that Jeremiah come to the palace , where the king asked him , “ Do you have any messages from the Lord ? ” “ Yes , I do ! ” said Jeremiah . “ You will be defeated by the king of Babylon . ”
24:37:018:0	Then Jeremiah asked the king , “ What crime have I committed ? What have I done against you , your attendants , or the people that I should be imprisoned like this ?
24:37:019:0	Where are your prophets now who told you the king of Babylon would not attack you or this land ?
24:37:020:0	Listen , my lord the king , I beg you . Do n't send me back to the dungeon in the house of Jonathan the secretary , for I will die there . ”
24:37:021:0	So King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah not be returned to the dungeon . Instead , he was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace . The king also commanded that Jeremiah be given a loaf of fresh bread every day as long as there was any left in the city . So Jeremiah was put in the palace prison .
