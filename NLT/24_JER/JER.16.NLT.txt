24:16:001:1	Jeremiah Forbidden to Marry
24:16:001:0	The Lord gave me another message . He said ,
24:16:002:0	“ Do not get married or have children in this place .
24:16:003:0	For this is what the Lord says about the children born here in this city and about their mothers and fathers :
24:16:002:1	Judah 's Coming Punishment
24:16:004:0	They will die from terrible diseases . No one will mourn for them or bury them , and they will lie scattered on the ground like manure . They will die from war and famine , and their bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals . ”
24:16:005:0	This is what the Lord says : “ Do not go to funerals to mourn and show sympathy for these people , for I have removed my protection and peace from them . I have taken away my unfailing love and my mercy .
24:16:006:0	Both the great and the lowly will die in this land . No one will bury them or mourn for them . Their friends will not cut themselves in sorrow or shave their heads in sadness .
24:16:007:0	No one will offer a meal to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even at the death of a mother or father . No one will send a cup of wine to console them .
24:16:008:0	“ And do not go to their feasts and parties . Do not eat and drink with them at all .
24:16:009:0	For this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : In your own lifetime , before your very eyes , I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in this land . The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard .
24:16:010:0	“ When you tell the people all these things , they will ask , ‘ Why has the Lord decreed such terrible things against us ? What have we done to deserve such treatment ? What is our sin against the Lord our God ? '
24:16:011:0	“ Then you will give them the Lord 's reply : ‘ It is because your ancestors were unfaithful to me . They worshiped other gods and served them . They abandoned me and did not obey my word .
24:16:012:0	And you are even worse than your ancestors ! You stubbornly follow your own evil desires and refuse to listen to me .
24:16:003:1	Hope despite the Disaster
24:16:013:0	So I will throw you out of this land and send you into a foreign land where you and your ancestors have never been . There you can worship idols day and night—and I will grant you no favors ! '
24:16:014:0	“ But the time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when people who are taking an oath will no longer say , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt . '
24:16:015:0	Instead , they will say , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them . ' For I will bring them back to this land that I gave their ancestors .
24:16:016:0	“ But now I am sending for many fishermen who will catch them , ” says the Lord . “ I am sending for hunters who will hunt them down in the mountains , hills , and caves .
24:16:017:0	I am watching them closely , and I see every sin . They can not hope to hide from me .
24:16:004:1	Jeremiah 's Prayer of Confidence
24:16:018:0	I will double their punishment for all their sins , because they have defiled my land with lifeless images of their detestable gods and have filled my territory with their evil deeds . ”
24:16:019:0	Lord , you are my strength and fortress , my refuge in the day of trouble ! Nations from around the worldwill come to you and say , “ Our ancestors left us a foolish heritage , for they worshiped worthless idols .
24:16:020:0	Can people make their own gods ? These are not real gods at all ! ”
24:16:021:0	The Lord says , “ Now I will show them my power ; now I will show them my might.At last they will know and understandthat I am the Lord .
