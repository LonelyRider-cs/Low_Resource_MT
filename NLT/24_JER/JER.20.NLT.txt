24:20:001:1	Jeremiah and Pashhur
24:20:001:0	Now Pashhur son of Immer , the priest in charge of the Temple of the Lord , heard what Jeremiah was prophesying .
24:20:002:0	So he arrested Jeremiah the prophet and had him whipped and put in stocks at the Benjamin Gate of the Lord 's Temple .
24:20:003:0	The next day , when Pashhur finally released him , Jeremiah said , “ Pashhur , the Lord has changed your name . From now on you are to be called ‘ The Man Who Lives in Terror . '
24:20:004:0	For this is what the Lord says : ‘ I will send terror upon you and all your friends , and you will watch as they are slaughtered by the swords of the enemy . I will hand the people of Judah over to the king of Babylon . He will take them captive to Babylon or run them through with the sword .
24:20:005:0	And I will let your enemies plunder Jerusalem . All the famed treasures of the city — the precious jewels and gold and silver of your kings — will be carried off to Babylon .
24:20:002:1	Jeremiah 's Complaint
24:20:006:0	As for you , Pashhur , you and all your household will go as captives to Babylon . There you will die and be buried , you and all your friends to whom you prophesied that everything would be all right . ' ”
24:20:007:0	O Lord , you misled me , and I allowed myself to be misled.You are stronger than I am , and you overpowered me.Now I am mocked every day ; everyone laughs at me .
24:20:008:0	When I speak , the words burst out. “ Violence and destruction ! ” I shout.So these messages from the Lordhave made me a household joke .
24:20:009:0	But if I say I 'll never mention the Lordor speak in his name , his word burns in my heart like a fire.It 's like a fire in my bones ! I am worn out trying to hold it in ! I ca n't do it !
24:20:010:0	I have heard the many rumors about me.They call me “ The Man Who Lives in Terror. ” They threaten , “ If you say anything , we will report it. ” Even my old friends are watching me , waiting for a fatal slip. “ He will trap himself , ” they say , “ and then we will get our revenge on him . ”
24:20:011:0	But the Lord stands beside me like a great warrior.Before him my persecutors will stumble.They can not defeat me.They will fail and be thoroughly humiliated.Their dishonor will never be forgotten .
24:20:012:0	O Lord of Heaven 's Armies , you test those who are righteous , and you examine the deepest thoughts and secrets.Let me see your vengeance against them , for I have committed my cause to you .
24:20:013:0	Sing to the Lord ! Praise the Lord ! For though I was poor and needy , he rescued me from my oppressors .
24:20:014:0	Yet I curse the day I was born ! May no one celebrate the day of my birth .
24:20:015:0	I curse the messenger who told my father , “ Good news — you have a son ! ”
24:20:016:0	Let him be destroyed like the cities of oldthat the Lord overthrew without mercy.Terrify him all day long with battle shouts ,
24:20:017:0	because he did not kill me at birth.Oh , that I had died in my mother 's womb , that her body had been my grave !
24:20:018:0	Why was I ever born ? My entire life has been filledwith trouble , sorrow , and shame .
