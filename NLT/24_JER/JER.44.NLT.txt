24:44:001:1	Judgment for Idolatry
24:44:001:0	This is the message Jeremiah received concerning the Judeans living in northern Egypt in the cities of Migdol , Tahpanhes , and Memphis , and in southern Egypt as well :
24:44:002:0	“ This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : You saw the calamity I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah . They now lie deserted and in ruins .
24:44:003:0	They provoked my anger with all their wickedness . They burned incense and worshiped other gods — gods that neither they nor you nor any of your ancestors had ever even known .
24:44:004:0	“ Again and again I sent my servants , the prophets , to plead with them , ‘ Do n't do these horrible things that I hate so much . '
24:44:005:0	But my people would not listen or turn back from their wicked ways . They kept on burning incense to these gods .
24:44:006:0	And so my fury boiled over and fell like fire on the towns of Judah and into the streets of Jerusalem , and they are still a desolate ruin today .
24:44:007:0	“ And now the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , asks you : Why are you destroying yourselves ? For not one of you will survive — not a man , woman , or child among you who has come here from Judah , not even the babies in your arms .
24:44:008:0	Why provoke my anger by burning incense to the idols you have made here in Egypt ? You will only destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and mockery for all the nations of the earth .
24:44:009:0	Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors , the sins of the kings and queens of Judah , and the sins you and your wives committed in Judah and Jerusalem ?
24:44:010:0	To this very hour you have shown no remorse or reverence . No one has chosen to follow my word and the decrees I gave to you and your ancestors before you .
24:44:011:0	“ Therefore , this is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : I am determined to destroy every one of you !
24:44:012:0	I will take this remnant of Judah — those who were determined to come here and live in Egypt — and I will consume them . They will fall here in Egypt , killed by war and famine . All will die , from the least to the greatest . They will be an object of damnation , horror , cursing , and mockery .
24:44:013:0	I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem , by war , famine , and disease .
24:44:014:0	Of that remnant who fled to Egypt , hoping someday to return to Judah , there will be no survivors . Even though they long to return home , only a handful will do so . ”
24:44:015:0	Then all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to idols — a great crowd of all the Judeans living in northern Egypt and southern Egypt — answered Jeremiah ,
24:44:016:0	“ We will not listen to your messages from the Lord !
24:44:017:0	We will do whatever we want . We will burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven just as much as we like — just as we , and our ancestors , and our kings and officials have always done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . For in those days we had plenty to eat , and we were well off and had no troubles !
24:44:018:0	But ever since we quit burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and stopped worshiping her with liquid offerings , we have been in great trouble and have been dying from war and famine . ”
24:44:019:0	“ Besides , ” the women added , “ do you suppose that we were burning incense and pouring out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven , and making cakes marked with her image , without our husbands knowing it and helping us ? Of course not ! ”
24:44:020:0	Then Jeremiah said to all of them , men and women alike , who had given him that answer ,
24:44:021:0	“ Do you think the Lord did not know that you and your ancestors , your kings and officials , and all the people were burning incense to idols in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
24:44:022:0	It was because the Lord could no longer bear all the disgusting things you were doing that he made your land an object of cursing — a desolate ruin without inhabitants — as it is today .
24:44:023:0	All these terrible things happened to you because you have burned incense to idols and sinned against the Lord . You have refused to obey him and have not followed his instructions , his decrees , and his laws . ”
24:44:024:0	Then Jeremiah said to them all , including the women , “ Listen to this message from the Lord , all you citizens of Judah who live in Egypt .
24:44:025:0	This is what the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You and your wives have said , “ We will keep our promises to burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven , ” and you have proved by your actions that you meant it . So go ahead and carry out your promises and vows to her ! '
24:44:026:0	“ But listen to this message from the Lord , all you Judeans now living in Egypt : ‘ I have sworn by my great name , ' says the Lord , ‘ that my name will no longer be spoken by any of the Judeans in the land of Egypt . None of you may invoke my name or use this oath : “ As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives . ”
24:44:027:0	For I will watch over you to bring you disaster and not good . Everyone from Judah who is now living in Egypt will suffer war and famine until all of you are dead .
24:44:028:0	Only a small number will escape death and return to Judah from Egypt . Then all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words are true — mine or theirs !
24:44:029:0	“ ‘ And this is the proof I give you , ' says the Lord , ‘ that all I have threatened will happen to you and that I will punish you here . '
24:44:030:0	This is what the Lord says : ‘ I will turn Pharaoh Hophra , king of Egypt , over to his enemies who want to kill him , just as I turned King Zedekiah of Judah over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . ' ”
