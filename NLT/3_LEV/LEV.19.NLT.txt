3:19:001:1	Holiness in Personal Conduct
3:19:001:0	The Lord also said to Moses ,
3:19:002:0	“ Give the following instructions to the entire community of Israel . You must be holy because I , the Lord your God , am holy .
3:19:003:0	“ Each of you must show great respect for your mother and father , and you must always observe my Sabbath days of rest . I am the Lord your God .
3:19:004:0	“ Do not put your trust in idols or make metal images of gods for yourselves . I am the Lord your God .
3:19:005:0	“ When you sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord , offer it properly so you will be accepted by God .
3:19:006:0	The sacrifice must be eaten on the same day you offer it or on the next day . Whatever is left over until the third day must be completely burned up .
3:19:007:0	If any of the sacrifice is eaten on the third day , it will be contaminated , and I will not accept it .
3:19:008:0	Anyone who eats it on the third day will be punished for defiling what is holy to the Lord and will be cut off from the community .
3:19:009:0	“ When you harvest the crops of your land , do not harvest the grain along the edges of your fields , and do not pick up what the harvesters drop .
3:19:010:0	It is the same with your grape crop — do not strip every last bunch of grapes from the vines , and do not pick up the grapes that fall to the ground . Leave them for the poor and the foreigners living among you . I am the Lord your God .
3:19:011:0	“ Do not steal. “ Do not deceive or cheat one another .
3:19:012:0	“ Do not bring shame on the name of your God by using it to swear falsely . I am the Lord .
3:19:013:0	“ Do not defraud or rob your neighbor. “ Do not make your hired workers wait until the next day to receive their pay .
3:19:014:0	“ Do not insult the deaf or cause the blind to stumble . You must fear your God ; I am the Lord .
3:19:015:0	“ Do not twist justice in legal matters by favoring the poor or being partial to the rich and powerful . Always judge people fairly .
3:19:016:0	“ Do not spread slanderous gossip among your people. “ Do not stand idly by when your neighbor 's life is threatened . I am the Lord .
3:19:017:0	“ Do not nurse hatred in your heart for any of your relatives . Confront people directly so you will not be held guilty for their sin .
3:19:018:0	“ Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against a fellow Israelite , but love your neighbor as yourself . I am the Lord .
3:19:019:0	“ You must obey all my decrees. “ Do not mate two different kinds of animals . Do not plant your field with two different kinds of seed . Do not wear clothing woven from two different kinds of thread .
3:19:020:0	“ If a man has sex with a slave girl whose freedom has never been purchased but who is committed to become another man 's wife , he must pay full compensation to her master . But since she is not a free woman , neither the man nor the woman will be put to death .
3:19:021:0	The man , however , must bring a ram as a guilt offering and present it to the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
3:19:022:0	The priest will then purify him before the Lord with the ram of the guilt offering , and the man 's sin will be forgiven .
3:19:023:0	“ When you enter the land and plant fruit trees , leave the fruit unharvested for the first three years and consider it forbidden . Do not eat it .
3:19:024:0	In the fourth year the entire crop must be consecrated to the Lord as a celebration of praise .
3:19:025:0	Finally , in the fifth year you may eat the fruit . If you follow this pattern , your harvest will increase . I am the Lord your God .
3:19:026:0	“ Do not eat meat that has not been drained of its blood. “ Do not practice fortune-telling or witchcraft .
3:19:027:0	“ Do not trim off the hair on your temples or trim your beards .
3:19:028:0	“ Do not cut your bodies for the dead , and do not mark your skin with tattoos . I am the Lord .
3:19:029:0	“ Do not defile your daughter by making her a prostitute , or the land will be filled with prostitution and wickedness .
3:19:030:0	“ Keep my Sabbath days of rest , and show reverence toward my sanctuary . I am the Lord .
3:19:031:0	“ Do not defile yourselves by turning to mediums or to those who consult the spirits of the dead . I am the Lord your God .
3:19:032:0	“ Stand up in the presence of the elderly , and show respect for the aged . Fear your God . I am the Lord .
3:19:033:0	“ Do not take advantage of foreigners who live among you in your land .
3:19:034:0	Treat them like native-born Israelites , and love them as you love yourself . Remember that you were once foreigners living in the land of Egypt . I am the Lord your God .
3:19:035:0	“ Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length , weight , or volume .
3:19:036:0	Your scales and weights must be accurate . Your containers for measuring dry materials or liquids must be accurate . I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt .
3:19:037:0	“ You must be careful to keep all of my decrees and regulations by putting them into practice . I am the Lord . ”
