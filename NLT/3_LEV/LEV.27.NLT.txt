3:27:001:1	Redemption of Gifts Offered to the
3:27:002:1	Lord
3:27:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
3:27:002:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate someone to the Lord by paying the value of that person ,
3:27:003:0	here is the scale of values to be used . A man between the ages of twenty and sixty is valued at fifty shekels of silver , as measured by the sanctuary shekel .
3:27:004:0	A woman of that age is valued at thirty shekels of silver .
3:27:005:0	A boy between the ages of five and twenty is valued at twenty shekels of silver ; a girl of that age is valued at ten shekels of silver .
3:27:006:0	A boy between the ages of one month and five years is valued at five shekels of silver ; a girl of that age is valued at three shekels of silver .
3:27:007:0	A man older than sixty is valued at fifteen shekels of silver ; a woman of that age is valued at ten shekels of silver .
3:27:008:0	If you desire to make such a vow but can not afford to pay the required amount , take the person to the priest . He will determine the amount for you to pay based on what you can afford .
3:27:009:0	“ If your vow involves giving an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the Lord , any gift to the Lord will be considered holy .
3:27:010:0	You may not exchange or substitute it for another animal—neither a good animal for a bad one nor a bad animal for a good one . But if you do exchange one animal for another , then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy .
3:27:011:0	If your vow involves an unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the Lord—then you must bring the animal to the priest .
3:27:012:0	He will assess its value , and his assessment will be final , whether high or low .
3:27:013:0	If you want to buy back the animal , you must pay the value set by the priest , plus 20 percent .
3:27:014:0	“ If someone dedicates a house to the Lord , the priest will come to assess its value . The priest 's assessment will be final , whether high or low .
3:27:015:0	If the person who dedicated the house wants to buy it back , he must pay the value set by the priest , plus 20 percent . Then the house will again be his .
3:27:016:0	“ If someone dedicates to the Lord a piece of his family property , its value will be assessed according to the amount of seed required to plant it—fifty shekels of silver for a field planted with five bushels of barley seed .
3:27:017:0	If the field is dedicated to the Lord in the Year of Jubilee , then the entire assessment will apply .
3:27:018:0	But if the field is dedicated after the Year of Jubilee , the priest will assess the land 's value in proportion to the number of years left until the next Year of Jubilee . Its assessed value is reduced each year .
3:27:019:0	If the person who dedicated the field wants to buy it back , he must pay the value set by the priest , plus 20 percent . Then the field will again be legally his .
3:27:020:0	But if he does not want to buy it back , and it is sold to someone else , the field can no longer be bought back .
3:27:021:0	When the field is released in the Year of Jubilee , it will be holy , a field specially set apart for the Lord . It will become the property of the priests .
3:27:022:0	“ If someone dedicates to the Lord a field he has purchased but which is not part of his family property ,
3:27:023:0	the priest will assess its value based on the number of years left until the next Year of Jubilee . On that day he must give the assessed value of the land as a sacred donation to the Lord .
3:27:024:0	In the Year of Jubilee the field must be returned to the person from whom he purchased it , the one who inherited it as family property .
3:27:025:0	( All the payments must be measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel , which equals twenty gerahs . )
3:27:026:0	“ You may not dedicate a firstborn animal to the Lord , for the firstborn of your cattle , sheep , and goats already belong to him .
3:27:027:0	However , you may buy back the firstborn of a ceremonially unclean animal by paying the priest 's assessment of its worth , plus 20 percent . If you do not buy it back , the priest will sell it at its assessed value .
3:27:028:0	“ However , anything specially set apart for the Lord—whether a person , an animal , or family property—must never be sold or bought back . Anything devoted in this way has been set apart as holy , and it belongs to the Lord .
3:27:029:0	No person specially set apart for destruction may be bought back . Such a person must be put to death .
3:27:030:0	“ One-tenth of the produce of the land , whether grain from the fields or fruit from the trees , belongs to the Lord and must be set apart to him as holy .
3:27:031:0	If you want to buy back the Lord 's tenth of the grain or fruit , you must pay its value , plus 20 percent .
3:27:032:0	Count off every tenth animal from your herds and flocks and set them apart for the Lord as holy .
3:27:033:0	You may not pick and choose between good and bad animals , and you may not substitute one for another . But if you do exchange one animal for another , then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy and can not be bought back . ”
3:27:034:0	These are the commands that the Lord gave through Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites .
