3:9:001:1	The Priests Begin Their Work
3:9:001:0	After the ordination ceremony , on the eighth day , Moses called together Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel .
3:9:002:0	He said to Aaron , “ Take a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering , both without defects , and present them to the Lord .
3:9:003:0	Then tell the Israelites , ‘ Take a male goat for a sin offering , and take a calf and a lamb , both a year old and without defects , for a burnt offering .
3:9:004:0	Also take a bull and a ram for a peace offering and flour moistened with olive oil for a grain offering . Present all these offerings to the Lord because the Lord will appear to you today . ' ”
3:9:005:0	So the people presented all these things at the entrance of the Tabernacle , just as Moses had commanded . Then the whole community came forward and stood before the Lord .
3:9:006:0	And Moses said , “ This is what the Lord has commanded you to do so that the glory of the Lord may appear to you . ”
3:9:007:0	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to purify yourself and the people . Then present the offerings of the people to purify them , making them right with the Lord , just as he has commanded . ”
3:9:008:0	So Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself .
3:9:009:0	His sons brought him the blood , and he dipped his finger in it and put it on the horns of the altar . He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar .
3:9:010:0	Then he burned on the altar the fat , the kidneys , and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
3:9:011:0	The meat and the hide , however , he burned outside the camp .
3:9:012:0	Next Aaron slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering . His sons brought him the blood , and he splattered it against all sides of the altar .
3:9:013:0	Then they handed him each piece of the burnt offering , including the head , and he burned them on the altar .
3:9:014:0	Then he washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on the altar along with the rest of the burnt offering .
3:9:015:0	Next Aaron presented the offerings of the people . He slaughtered the people 's goat and presented it as an offering for their sin , just as he had first done with the offering for his own sin .
3:9:016:0	Then he presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it in the prescribed way .
3:9:017:0	He also presented the grain offering , burning a handful of the flour mixture on the altar , in addition to the regular burnt offering for the morning .
3:9:018:0	Then Aaron slaughtered the bull and the ram for the people 's peace offering . His sons brought him the blood , and he splattered it against all sides of the altar .
3:9:019:0	Then he took the fat of the bull and the ram—the fat of the broad tail and from around the internal organs—along with the kidneys and the long lobes of the livers .
3:9:020:0	He placed these fat portions on top of the breasts of these animals and burned them on the altar .
3:9:021:0	Aaron then lifted up the breasts and right thighs as a special offering to the Lord , just as Moses had commanded .
3:9:022:0	After that , Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them . Then , after presenting the sin offering , the burnt offering , and the peace offering , he stepped down from the altar .
3:9:023:0	Then Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle , and when they came back out , they blessed the people again , and the glory of the Lord appeared to the whole community .
3:9:024:0	Fire blazed forth from the Lord 's presence and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar . When the people saw this , they shouted with joy and fell face down on the ground .
