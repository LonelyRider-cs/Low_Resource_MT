3:1:003:0	“ If the animal you present as a burnt offering is from the herd , it must be a male with no defects . Bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle so you may be accepted by the Lord .
3:1:004:0	Lay your hand on the animal 's head , and the Lord will accept its death in your place to purify you , making you right with him .
