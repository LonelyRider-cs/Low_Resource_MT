3:23:001:1	The Appointed Festivals
3:23:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
3:23:002:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . These are the Lord 's appointed festivals , which you are to proclaim as official days for holy assembly .
3:23:003:0	“ You have six days each week for your ordinary work , but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of complete rest , an official day for holy assembly . It is the Lord 's Sabbath day , and it must be observed wherever you live .
3:23:002:1	Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread
3:23:004:0	“ In addition to the Sabbath , these are the Lord 's appointed festivals , the official days for holy assembly that are to be celebrated at their proper times each year .
3:23:005:0	“ The Lord 's Passover begins at sundown on the fourteenth day of the first month .
3:23:006:0	On the next day , the fifteenth day of the month , you must begin celebrating the Festival of Unleavened Bread . This festival to the Lord continues for seven days , and during that time the bread you eat must be made without yeast .
3:23:007:0	On the first day of the festival , all the people must stop their ordinary work and observe an official day for holy assembly .
3:23:003:1	Celebration of First Harvest
3:23:008:0	For seven days you must present special gifts to the Lord . On the seventh day the people must again stop all their ordinary work to observe an official day for holy assembly . ”
3:23:009:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:23:010:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . When you enter the land I am giving you and you harvest its first crops , bring the priest a bundle of grain from the first cutting of your grain harvest .
3:23:011:0	On the day after the Sabbath , the priest will lift it up before the Lord so it may be accepted on your behalf .
3:23:012:0	On that same day you must sacrifice a one-year-old male lamb with no defects as a burnt offering to the Lord .
3:23:013:0	With it you must present a grain offering consisting of four quarts of choice flour moistened with olive oil . It will be a special gift , a pleasing aroma to the Lord . You must also offer one quart of wine as a liquid offering .
3:23:004:1	The Festival of Harvest
3:23:014:0	Do not eat any bread or roasted grain or fresh kernels on that day until you bring this offering to your God . This is a permanent law for you , and it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live .
3:23:015:0	“ From the day after the Sabbath—the day you bring the bundle of grain to be lifted up as a special offering—count off seven full weeks .
3:23:016:0	Keep counting until the day after the seventh Sabbath , fifty days later . Then present an offering of new grain to the Lord .
3:23:017:0	From wherever you live , bring two loaves of bread to be lifted up before the Lord as a special offering . Make these loaves from four quarts of choice flour , and bake them with yeast . They will be an offering to the Lord from the first of your crops .
3:23:018:0	Along with the bread , present seven one-year-old male lambs with no defects , one young bull , and two rams as burnt offerings to the Lord . These burnt offerings , together with the grain offerings and liquid offerings , will be a special gift , a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
3:23:019:0	Then you must offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a peace offering .
3:23:020:0	“ The priest will lift up the two lambs as a special offering to the Lord , together with the loaves representing the first of your crops . These offerings , which are holy to the Lord , belong to the priests .
3:23:021:0	That same day will be proclaimed an official day for holy assembly , a day on which you do no ordinary work . This is a permanent law for you , and it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live .
3:23:005:1	The Festival of Trumpets
3:23:022:0	“ When you harvest the crops of your land , do not harvest the grain along the edges of your fields , and do not pick up what the harvesters drop . Leave it for the poor and the foreigners living among you . I am the Lord your God . ”
3:23:023:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
3:23:024:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . On the first day of the appointed month in early autumn , you are to observe a day of complete rest . It will be an official day for holy assembly , a day commemorated with loud blasts of a trumpet .
3:23:006:1	The Day of Atonement
3:23:025:0	You must do no ordinary work on that day . Instead , you are to present special gifts to the Lord . ”
3:23:026:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:23:027:0	“ Be careful to celebrate the Day of Atonement on the tenth day of that same month—nine days after the Festival of Trumpets . You must observe it as an official day for holy assembly , a day to deny yourselves and present special gifts to the Lord .
3:23:028:0	Do no work during that entire day because it is the Day of Atonement , when offerings of purification are made for you , making you right with the Lord your God .
3:23:029:0	All who do not deny themselves that day will be cut off from God 's people .
3:23:030:0	And I will destroy anyone among you who does any work on that day .
3:23:031:0	You must not do any work at all ! This is a permanent law for you , and it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live .
3:23:007:1	The Festival of Shelters
3:23:032:0	This will be a Sabbath day of complete rest for you , and on that day you must deny yourselves . This day of rest will begin at sundown on the ninth day of the month and extend until sundown on the tenth day . ”
3:23:033:0	And the Lord said to Moses ,
3:23:034:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . Begin celebrating the Festival of Shelters on the fifteenth day of the appointed month—five days after the Day of Atonement . This festival to the Lord will last for seven days .
3:23:035:0	On the first day of the festival you must proclaim an official day for holy assembly , when you do no ordinary work .
3:23:036:0	For seven days you must present special gifts to the Lord . The eighth day is another holy day on which you present your special gifts to the Lord . This will be a solemn occasion , and no ordinary work may be done that day .
3:23:037:0	( “ These are the Lord 's appointed festivals . Celebrate them each year as official days for holy assembly by presenting special gifts to the Lord—burnt offerings , grain offerings , sacrifices , and liquid offerings—each on its proper day .
3:23:038:0	These festivals must be observed in addition to the Lord 's regular Sabbath days , and the offerings are in addition to your personal gifts , the offerings you give to fulfill your vows , and the voluntary offerings you present to the Lord . )
3:23:039:0	“ Remember that this seven-day festival to the Lord—the Festival of Shelters—begins on the fifteenth day of the appointed month , after you have harvested all the produce of the land . The first day and the eighth day of the festival will be days of complete rest .
3:23:040:0	On the first day gather branches from magnificent trees—palm fronds , boughs from leafy trees , and willows that grow by the streams . Then celebrate with joy before the Lord your God for seven days .
3:23:041:0	You must observe this festival to the Lord for seven days every year . This is a permanent law for you , and it must be observed in the appointed month from generation to generation .
3:23:042:0	For seven days you must live outside in little shelters . All native-born Israelites must live in shelters .
3:23:043:0	This will remind each new generation of Israelites that I made their ancestors live in shelters when I rescued them from the land of Egypt . I am the Lord your God . ”
3:23:044:0	So Moses gave the Israelites these instructions regarding the annual festivals of the Lord .
