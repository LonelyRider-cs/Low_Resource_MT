3:8:001:1	Ordination of the Priests
3:8:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:8:002:0	“ Bring Aaron and his sons , along with their sacred garments , the anointing oil , the bull for the sin offering , the two rams , and the basket of bread made without yeast ,
3:8:003:0	and call the entire community of Israel together at the entrance of the Tabernacle . ”
3:8:004:0	So Moses followed the Lord 's instructions , and the whole community assembled at the Tabernacle entrance .
3:8:005:0	Moses announced to them , “ This is what the Lord has commanded us to do ! ”
3:8:006:0	Then he presented Aaron and his sons and washed them with water .
3:8:007:0	He put the official tunic on Aaron and tied the sash around his waist . He dressed him in the robe , placed the ephod on him , and attached the ephod securely with its decorative sash .
3:8:008:0	Then Moses placed the chestpiece on Aaron and put the Urim and the Thummim inside it .
3:8:009:0	He placed the turban on Aaron 's head and attached the gold medallion — the badge of holiness — to the front of the turban , just as the Lord had commanded him .
3:8:010:0	Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the Tabernacle and everything in it , making them holy .
3:8:011:0	He sprinkled the oil on the altar seven times , anointing it and all its utensils , as well as the washbasin and its stand , making them holy .
3:8:012:0	Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron 's head , anointing him and making him holy for his work .
3:8:013:0	Next Moses presented Aaron 's sons . He clothed them in their tunics , tied their sashes around them , and put their special head coverings on them , just as the Lord had commanded him .
3:8:014:0	Then Moses presented the bull for the sin offering . Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the bull 's head ,
3:8:015:0	and Moses slaughtered it . Moses took some of the blood , and with his finger he put it on the four horns of the altar to purify it . He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar . Through this process , he made the altar holy by purifying it .
3:8:016:0	Then Moses took all the fat around the internal organs , the long lobe of the liver , and the two kidneys and the fat around them , and he burned it all on the altar .
3:8:017:0	He took the rest of the bull , including its hide , meat , and dung , and burned it on a fire outside the camp , just as the Lord had commanded him .
3:8:018:0	Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering . Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram 's head ,
3:8:019:0	and Moses slaughtered it . Then Moses took the ram 's blood and splattered it against all sides of the altar .
3:8:020:0	Then he cut the ram into pieces , and he burned the head , some of its pieces , and the fat on the altar .
3:8:021:0	After washing the internal organs and the legs with water , Moses burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering . It was a pleasing aroma , a special gift presented to the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded him .
3:8:022:0	Then Moses presented the other ram , which was the ram of ordination . Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram 's head ,
3:8:023:0	and Moses slaughtered it . Then Moses took some of its blood and applied it to the lobe of Aaron 's right ear , the thumb of his right hand , and the big toe of his right foot .
3:8:024:0	Next Moses presented Aaron 's sons and applied some of the blood to the lobes of their right ears , the thumbs of their right hands , and the big toes of their right feet . He then splattered the rest of the blood against all sides of the altar .
3:8:025:0	Next Moses took the fat , including the fat of the broad tail , the fat around the internal organs , the long lobe of the liver , and the two kidneys and the fat around them , along with the right thigh .
3:8:026:0	On top of these he placed a thin cake of bread made without yeast , a cake of bread mixed with olive oil , and a wafer spread with olive oil . All these were taken from the basket of bread made without yeast that was placed in the Lord 's presence .
3:8:027:0	He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons , and he lifted these gifts as a special offering to the Lord .
3:8:028:0	Moses then took all the offerings back from them and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering . This was the ordination offering . It was a pleasing aroma , a special gift presented to the Lord .
3:8:029:0	Then Moses took the breast and lifted it up as a special offering to the Lord . This was Moses ' portion of the ram of ordination , just as the Lord had commanded him .
3:8:030:0	Next Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar , and he sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments . In this way , he made Aaron and his sons and their garments holy .
3:8:031:0	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons , “ Boil the remaining meat of the offerings at the Tabernacle entrance , and eat it there , along with the bread that is in the basket of offerings for the ordination , just as I commanded when I said , ‘ Aaron and his sons will eat it . '
3:8:032:0	Any meat or bread that is left over must then be burned up .
3:8:033:0	You must not leave the Tabernacle entrance for seven days , for that is when the ordination ceremony will be completed .
3:8:034:0	Everything we have done today was commanded by the Lord in order to purify you , making you right with him .
3:8:035:0	Now stay at the entrance of the Tabernacle day and night for seven days , and do everything the Lord requires . If you fail to do this , you will die , for this is what the Lord has commanded . ”
3:8:036:0	So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord had commanded through Moses .
