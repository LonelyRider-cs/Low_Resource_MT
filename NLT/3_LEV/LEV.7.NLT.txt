3:7:001:1	Further Instructions for the Guilt Offering
3:7:001:0	“ These are the instructions for the guilt offering . It is most holy .
3:7:002:0	The animal sacrificed as a guilt offering must be slaughtered at the place where the burnt offerings are slaughtered , and its blood must be splattered against all sides of the altar .
3:7:003:0	The priest will then offer all its fat on the altar , including the fat of the broad tail , the fat around the internal organs ,
3:7:004:0	the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins , and the long lobe of the liver . These are to be removed with the kidneys ,
3:7:005:0	and the priests will burn them on the altar as a special gift presented to the Lord . This is the guilt offering .
3:7:006:0	Any male from a priest 's family may eat the meat . It must be eaten in a sacred place , for it is most holy .
3:7:007:0	“ The same instructions apply to both the guilt offering and the sin offering . Both belong to the priest who uses them to purify someone , making that person right with the Lord .
3:7:008:0	In the case of the burnt offering , the priest may keep the hide of the sacrificed animal .
3:7:009:0	Any grain offering that has been baked in an oven , prepared in a pan , or cooked on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it .
3:7:002:1	Further Instructions for the Peace Offering
3:7:010:0	All other grain offerings , whether made of dry flour or flour moistened with olive oil , are to be shared equally among all the priests , the descendants of Aaron .
3:7:011:0	“ These are the instructions regarding the different kinds of peace offerings that may be presented to the Lord .
3:7:012:0	If you present your peace offering as an expression of thanksgiving , the usual animal sacrifice must be accompanied by various kinds of bread made without yeast — thin cakes mixed with olive oil , wafers spread with oil , and cakes made of choice flour mixed with olive oil .
3:7:013:0	This peace offering of thanksgiving must also be accompanied by loaves of bread made with yeast .
3:7:014:0	One of each kind of bread must be presented as a gift to the Lord . It will then belong to the priest who splatters the blood of the peace offering against the altar .
3:7:015:0	The meat of the peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the same day it is offered . None of it may be saved for the next morning .
3:7:016:0	“ If you bring an offering to fulfill a vow or as a voluntary offering , the meat must be eaten on the same day the sacrifice is offered , but whatever is left over may be eaten on the second day .
3:7:017:0	Any meat left over until the third day must be completely burned up .
3:7:018:0	If any of the meat from the peace offering is eaten on the third day , the person who presented it will not be accepted by the Lord . You will receive no credit for offering it . By then the meat will be contaminated ; if you eat it , you will be punished for your sin .
3:7:019:0	“ Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean may not be eaten ; it must be completely burned up . The rest of the meat may be eaten , but only by people who are ceremonially clean .
3:7:020:0	If you are ceremonially unclean and you eat meat from a peace offering that was presented to the Lord , you will be cut off from the community .
3:7:003:1	The Forbidden Blood and Fat
3:7:021:0	If you touch anything that is unclean ( whether it is human defilement or an unclean animal or any other unclean , detestable thing ) and then eat meat from a peace offering presented to the Lord , you will be cut off from the community . ”
3:7:022:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:7:023:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . You must never eat fat , whether from cattle , sheep , or goats .
3:7:024:0	The fat of an animal found dead or torn to pieces by wild animals must never be eaten , though it may be used for any other purpose .
3:7:025:0	Anyone who eats fat from an animal presented as a special gift to the Lord will be cut off from the community .
3:7:026:0	No matter where you live , you must never consume the blood of any bird or animal .
3:7:004:1	A Portion for the Priests
3:7:027:0	Anyone who consumes blood will be cut off from the community . ”
3:7:028:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:7:029:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . When you present a peace offering to the Lord , bring part of it as a gift to the Lord .
3:7:030:0	Present it to the Lord with your own hands as a special gift to the Lord . Bring the fat of the animal , together with the breast , and lift up the breast as a special offering to the Lord .
3:7:031:0	Then the priest will burn the fat on the altar , but the breast will belong to Aaron and his descendants .
3:7:032:0	Give the right thigh of your peace offering to the priest as a gift .
3:7:033:0	The right thigh must always be given to the priest who offers the blood and the fat of the peace offering .
3:7:034:0	For I have reserved the breast of the special offering and the right thigh of the sacred offering for the priests . It is the permanent right of Aaron and his descendants to share in the peace offerings brought by the people of Israel .
3:7:035:0	This is their rightful share . The special gifts presented to the Lord have been reserved for Aaron and his descendants from the time they were set apart to serve the Lord as priests .
3:7:036:0	On the day they were anointed , the Lord commanded the Israelites to give these portions to the priests as their permanent share from generation to generation . ”
3:7:037:0	These are the instructions for the burnt offering , the grain offering , the sin offering , and the guilt offering , as well as the ordination offering and the peace offering .
3:7:038:0	The Lord gave these instructions to Moses on Mount Sinai when he commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai .
