3:16:001:1	The Day of Atonement
3:16:001:0	The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron 's two sons , who died after they entered the Lord 's presence and burned the wrong kind of fire before him .
3:16:002:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ Warn your brother , Aaron , not to enter the Most Holy Place behind the inner curtain whenever he chooses ; if he does , he will die . For the Ark 's cover—the place of atonement—is there , and I myself am present in the cloud above the atonement cover .
3:16:003:0	“ When Aaron enters the sanctuary area , he must follow these instructions fully . He must bring a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering .
3:16:004:0	He must put on his linen tunic and the linen undergarments worn next to his body . He must tie the linen sash around his waist and put the linen turban on his head . These are sacred garments , so he must bathe himself in water before he puts them on .
3:16:005:0	Aaron must take from the community of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering .
3:16:006:0	“ Aaron will present his own bull as a sin offering to purify himself and his family , making them right with the Lord .
3:16:007:0	Then he must take the two male goats and present them to the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
3:16:008:0	He is to cast sacred lots to determine which goat will be reserved as an offering to the Lord and which will carry the sins of the people to the wilderness of Azazel .
3:16:009:0	Aaron will then present as a sin offering the goat chosen by lot for the Lord .
3:16:010:0	The other goat , the scapegoat chosen by lot to be sent away , will be kept alive , standing before the Lord . When it is sent away to Azazel in the wilderness , the people will be purified and made right with the Lord .
3:16:011:0	“ Aaron will present his own bull as a sin offering to purify himself and his family , making them right with the Lord . After he has slaughtered the bull as a sin offering ,
3:16:012:0	he will fill an incense burner with burning coals from the altar that stands before the Lord . Then he will take two handfuls of fragrant powdered incense and will carry the burner and the incense behind the inner curtain .
3:16:013:0	There in the Lord 's presence he will put the incense on the burning coals so that a cloud of incense will rise over the Ark 's cover—the place of atonement—that rests on the Ark of the Covenant . If he follows these instructions , he will not die .
3:16:014:0	Then he must take some of the blood of the bull , dip his finger in it , and sprinkle it on the east side of the atonement cover . He must sprinkle blood seven times with his finger in front of the atonement cover .
3:16:015:0	“ Then Aaron must slaughter the first goat as a sin offering for the people and carry its blood behind the inner curtain . There he will sprinkle the goat 's blood over the atonement cover and in front of it , just as he did with the bull 's blood .
3:16:016:0	Through this process , he will purify the Most Holy Place , and he will do the same for the entire Tabernacle , because of the defiling sin and rebellion of the Israelites .
3:16:017:0	No one else is allowed inside the Tabernacle when Aaron enters it for the purification ceremony in the Most Holy Place . No one may enter until he comes out again after purifying himself , his family , and all the congregation of Israel , making them right with the Lord .
3:16:018:0	“ Then Aaron will come out to purify the altar that stands before the Lord . He will do this by taking some of the blood from the bull and the goat and putting it on each of the horns of the altar .
3:16:019:0	Then he must sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times over the altar . In this way , he will cleanse it from Israel 's defilement and make it holy .
3:16:020:0	“ When Aaron has finished purifying the Most Holy Place and the Tabernacle and the altar , he must present the live goat .
3:16:021:0	He will lay both of his hands on the goat 's head and confess over it all the wickedness , rebellion , and sins of the people of Israel . In this way , he will transfer the people 's sins to the head of the goat . Then a man specially chosen for the task will drive the goat into the wilderness .
3:16:022:0	As the goat goes into the wilderness , it will carry all the people 's sins upon itself into a desolate land .
3:16:023:0	“ When Aaron goes back into the Tabernacle , he must take off the linen garments he was wearing when he entered the Most Holy Place , and he must leave the garments there .
3:16:024:0	Then he must bathe himself with water in a sacred place , put on his regular garments , and go out to sacrifice a burnt offering for himself and a burnt offering for the people . Through this process , he will purify himself and the people , making them right with the Lord .
3:16:025:0	He must then burn all the fat of the sin offering on the altar .
3:16:026:0	“ The man chosen to drive the scapegoat into the wilderness of Azazel must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water . Then he may return to the camp .
3:16:027:0	“ The bull and the goat presented as sin offerings , whose blood Aaron takes into the Most Holy Place for the purification ceremony , will be carried outside the camp . The animals ' hides , internal organs , and dung are all to be burned .
3:16:028:0	The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water before returning to the camp .
3:16:029:0	“ On the tenth day of the appointed month in early autumn , you must deny yourselves . Neither native-born Israelites nor foreigners living among you may do any kind of work . This is a permanent law for you .
3:16:030:0	On that day offerings of purification will be made for you , and you will be purified in the Lord 's presence from all your sins .
3:16:031:0	It will be a Sabbath day of complete rest for you , and you must deny yourselves . This is a permanent law for you .
3:16:032:0	In future generations , the purification ceremony will be performed by the priest who has been anointed and ordained to serve as high priest in place of his ancestor Aaron . He will put on the holy linen garments
3:16:033:0	and purify the Most Holy Place , the Tabernacle , the altar , the priests , and the entire congregation .
3:16:034:0	This is a permanent law for you , to purify the people of Israel from their sins , making them right with the Lord once each year. ” Moses followed all these instructions exactly as the Lord had commanded him .
