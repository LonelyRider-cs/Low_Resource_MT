3:5:001:1	Sins Requiring a Sin Offering
3:5:001:0	“ If you are called to testify about something you have seen or that you know about , it is sinful to refuse to testify , and you will be punished for your sin .
3:5:002:0	“ Or suppose you unknowingly touch something that is ceremonially unclean , such as the carcass of an unclean animal . When you realize what you have done , you must admit your defilement and your guilt . This is true whether it is a wild animal , a domestic animal , or an animal that scurries along the ground .
3:5:003:0	“ Or suppose you unknowingly touch something that makes a person unclean . When you realize what you have done , you must admit your guilt .
3:5:004:0	“ Or suppose you make a foolish vow of any kind , whether its purpose is for good or for bad . When you realize its foolishness , you must admit your guilt .
3:5:005:0	“ When you become aware of your guilt in any of these ways , you must confess your sin .
3:5:006:0	Then you must bring to the Lord as the penalty for your sin a female from the flock , either a sheep or a goat . This is a sin offering with which the priest will purify you from your sin , making you right with the Lord .
3:5:007:0	“ But if you can not afford to bring a sheep , you may bring to the Lord two turtledoves or two young pigeons as the penalty for your sin . One of the birds will be for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
3:5:008:0	You must bring them to the priest , who will present the first bird as the sin offering . He will wring its neck but without severing its head from the body .
3:5:009:0	Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering against the sides of the altar , and the rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar . This is an offering for sin .
3:5:010:0	The priest will then prepare the second bird as a burnt offering , following all the procedures that have been prescribed . Through this process the priest will purify you from your sin , making you right with the Lord , and you will be forgiven .
3:5:011:0	“ If you can not afford to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons , you may bring two quarts of choice flour for your sin offering . Since it is an offering for sin , you must not moisten it with olive oil or put any frankincense on it .
3:5:012:0	Take the flour to the priest , who will scoop out a handful as a representative portion . He will burn it on the altar on top of the special gifts presented to the Lord . It is an offering for sin .
3:5:002:1	Procedures for the Guilt Offering
3:5:013:0	Through this process , the priest will purify those who are guilty of any of these sins , making them right with the Lord , and they will be forgiven . The rest of the flour will belong to the priest , just as with the grain offering . ”
3:5:014:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:5:015:0	“ If one of you commits a sin by unintentionally defiling the Lord 's sacred property , you must bring a guilt offering to the Lord . The offering must be your own ram with no defects , or you may buy one of equal value with silver , as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel .
3:5:016:0	You must make restitution for the sacred property you have harmed by paying for the loss , plus an additional 20 percent . When you give the payment to the priest , he will purify you with the ram sacrificed as a guilt offering , making you right with the Lord , and you will be forgiven .
3:5:017:0	“ Suppose you sin by violating one of the Lord 's commands . Even if you are unaware of what you have done , you are guilty and will be punished for your sin .
3:5:018:0	For a guilt offering , you must bring to the priest your own ram with no defects , or you may buy one of equal value . Through this process the priest will purify you from your unintentional sin , making you right with the Lord , and you will be forgiven .
3:5:019:0	This is a guilt offering , for you have been guilty of an offense against the Lord . ”
