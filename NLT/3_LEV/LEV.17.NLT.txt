3:17:001:1	Prohibitions against Eating Blood
3:17:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:17:002:0	“ Give the following instructions to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel . This is what the Lord has commanded .
3:17:003:0	“ If any native Israelite sacrifices a bull or a lamb or a goat anywhere inside or outside the camp
3:17:004:0	instead of bringing it to the entrance of the Tabernacle to present it as an offering to the Lord , that person will be as guilty as a murderer . Such a person has shed blood and will be cut off from the community .
3:17:005:0	The purpose of this rule is to stop the Israelites from sacrificing animals in the open fields . It will ensure that they bring their sacrifices to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle , so he can present them to the Lord as peace offerings .
3:17:006:0	Then the priest will be able to splatter the blood against the Lord 's altar at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and he will burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
3:17:007:0	The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices to the goat idols . This is a permanent law for them , to be observed from generation to generation .
3:17:008:0	“ Give them this command as well . If any native Israelite or foreigner living among you offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
3:17:009:0	but does not bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle to offer it to the Lord , that person will be cut off from the community .
3:17:010:0	“ And if any native Israelite or foreigner living among you eats or drinks blood in any form , I will turn against that person and cut him off from the community of your people ,
3:17:011:0	for the life of the body is in its blood . I have given you the blood on the altar to purify you , making you right with the Lord . It is the blood , given in exchange for a life , that makes purification possible .
3:17:012:0	That is why I have said to the people of Israel , ‘ You must never eat or drink blood — neither you nor the foreigners living among you . '
3:17:013:0	“ And if any native Israelite or foreigner living among you goes hunting and kills an animal or bird that is approved for eating , he must drain its blood and cover it with earth .
3:17:014:0	The life of every creature is in its blood . That is why I have said to the people of Israel , ‘ You must never eat or drink blood , for the life of any creature is in its blood . ' So whoever consumes blood will be cut off from the community .
3:17:015:0	“ And if any native-born Israelites or foreigners eat the meat of an animal that died naturally or was torn up by wild animals , they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water . They will remain ceremonially unclean until evening , but then they will be clean .
3:17:016:0	But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe themselves , they will be punished for their sin . ”
