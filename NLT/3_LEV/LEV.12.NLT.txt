3:12:001:1	Purification after Childbirth
3:12:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
3:12:002:0	“ Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son , she will be ceremonially unclean for seven days , just as she is unclean during her menstrual period .
3:12:003:0	On the eighth day the boy 's foreskin must be circumcised .
3:12:004:0	After waiting thirty-three days , she will be purified from the bleeding of childbirth . During this time of purification , she must not touch anything that is set apart as holy . And she must not enter the sanctuary until her time of purification is over .
3:12:005:0	If a woman gives birth to a daughter , she will be ceremonially unclean for two weeks , just as she is unclean during her menstrual period . After waiting sixty-six days , she will be purified from the bleeding of childbirth .
3:12:006:0	“ When the time of purification is completed for either a son or a daughter , the woman must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a purification offering . She must bring her offerings to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
3:12:007:0	The priest will then present them to the Lord to purify her . Then she will be ceremonially clean again after her bleeding at childbirth . These are the instructions for a woman after the birth of a son or a daughter .
3:12:008:0	“ If a woman can not afford to bring a lamb , she must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons . One will be for the burnt offering and the other for the purification offering . The priest will sacrifice them to purify her , and she will be ceremonially clean . ”
