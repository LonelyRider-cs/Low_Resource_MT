3:22:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
3:22:002:0	“ Tell Aaron and his sons to be very careful with the sacred gifts that the Israelites set apart for me , so they do not bring shame on my holy name . I am the Lord .
3:22:003:0	Give them the following instructions. “ In all future generations , if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean when he approaches the sacred offerings that the people of Israel consecrate to the Lord , he must be cut off from my presence . I am the Lord .
3:22:004:0	“ If any of Aaron 's descendants has a skin disease or any kind of discharge that makes him ceremonially unclean , he may not eat from the sacred offerings until he has been pronounced clean . He also becomes unclean by touching a corpse , or by having an emission of semen ,
3:22:005:0	or by touching a small animal that is unclean , or by touching someone who is ceremonially unclean for any reason .
3:22:006:0	The man who is defiled in any of these ways will remain unclean until evening . He may not eat from the sacred offerings until he has bathed himself in water .
3:22:007:0	When the sun goes down , he will be ceremonially clean again and may eat from the sacred offerings , for this is his food .
3:22:008:0	He may not eat an animal that has died a natural death or has been torn apart by wild animals , for this would defile him . I am the Lord .
3:22:009:0	“ The priests must follow my instructions carefully . Otherwise they will be punished for their sin and will die for violating my instructions . I am the Lord who makes them holy .
3:22:010:0	“ No one outside a priest 's family may eat the sacred offerings . Even guests and hired workers in a priest 's home are not allowed to eat them .
3:22:011:0	However , if the priest buys a slave for himself , the slave may eat from the sacred offerings . And if his slaves have children , they also may share his food .
3:22:012:0	If a priest 's daughter marries someone outside the priestly family , she may no longer eat the sacred offerings .
3:22:013:0	But if she becomes a widow or is divorced and has no children to support her , and she returns to live in her father 's home as in her youth , she may eat her father 's food again . Otherwise , no one outside a priest 's family may eat the sacred offerings .
3:22:014:0	“ Any such person who eats the sacred offerings without realizing it must pay the priest for the amount eaten , plus an additional 20 percent .
3:22:015:0	The priests must not let the Israelites defile the sacred offerings brought to the Lord
3:22:001:1	Worthy and Unworthy Offerings
3:22:016:0	by allowing unauthorized people to eat them . This would bring guilt upon them and require them to pay compensation . I am the Lord who makes them holy . ”
3:22:017:0	And the Lord said to Moses ,
3:22:018:0	“ Give Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites these instructions , which apply both to native Israelites and to the foreigners living among you. “ If you present a gift as a burnt offering to the Lord , whether it is to fulfill a vow or is a voluntary offering ,
3:22:019:0	you will be accepted only if your offering is a male animal with no defects . It may be a bull , a ram , or a male goat .
3:22:020:0	Do not present an animal with defects , because the Lord will not accept it on your behalf .
3:22:021:0	“ If you present a peace offering to the Lord from the herd or the flock , whether it is to fulfill a vow or is a voluntary offering , you must offer a perfect animal . It may have no defect of any kind .
3:22:022:0	You must not offer an animal that is blind , crippled , or injured , or that has a wart , a skin sore , or scabs . Such animals must never be offered on the altar as special gifts to the Lord .
3:22:023:0	If a bull or lamb has a leg that is too long or too short , it may be offered as a voluntary offering , but it may not be offered to fulfill a vow .
3:22:024:0	If an animal has damaged testicles or is castrated , you may not offer it to the Lord . You must never do this in your own land ,
3:22:025:0	and you must not accept such an animal from foreigners and then offer it as a sacrifice to your God . Such animals will not be accepted on your behalf , for they are mutilated or defective . ”
3:22:026:0	And the Lord said to Moses ,
3:22:027:0	“ When a calf or lamb or goat is born , it must be left with its mother for seven days . From the eighth day on , it will be acceptable as a special gift to the Lord .
3:22:028:0	But you must not slaughter a mother animal and her offspring on the same day , whether from the herd or the flock .
3:22:029:0	When you bring a thanksgiving offering to the Lord , sacrifice it properly so you will be accepted .
3:22:030:0	Eat the entire sacrificial animal on the day it is presented . Do not leave any of it until the next morning . I am the Lord .
3:22:031:0	“ You must faithfully keep all my commands by putting them into practice , for I am the Lord .
3:22:032:0	Do not bring shame on my holy name , for I will display my holiness among the people of Israel . I am the Lord who makes you holy .
3:22:033:0	It was I who rescued you from the land of Egypt , that I might be your God . I am the Lord . ”
