3:6:001:1	Sins Requiring a Guilt Offering
3:6:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:6:002:0	“ Suppose one of you sins against your associate and is unfaithful to the Lord . Suppose you cheat in a deal involving a security deposit , or you steal or commit fraud ,
3:6:003:0	or you find lost property and lie about it , or you lie while swearing to tell the truth , or you commit any other such sin .
3:6:004:0	If you have sinned in any of these ways , you are guilty . You must give back whatever you stole , or the money you took by extortion , or the security deposit , or the lost property you found ,
3:6:005:0	or anything obtained by swearing falsely . You must make restitution by paying the full price plus an additional 20 percent to the person you have harmed . On the same day you must present a guilt offering .
3:6:006:0	As a guilt offering to the Lord , you must bring to the priest your own ram with no defects , or you may buy one of equal value .
3:6:002:1	Further Instructions for the Burnt Offering
3:6:007:0	Through this process , the priest will purify you before the Lord , making you right with him , and you will be forgiven for any of these sins you have committed . ”
3:6:008:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:6:009:0	“ Give Aaron and his sons the following instructions regarding the burnt offering . The burnt offering must be left on top of the altar until the next morning , and the fire on the altar must be kept burning all night .
3:6:010:0	In the morning , after the priest on duty has put on his official linen clothing and linen undergarments , he must clean out the ashes of the burnt offering and put them beside the altar .
3:6:011:0	Then he must take off these garments , change back into his regular clothes , and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean .
3:6:012:0	Meanwhile , the fire on the altar must be kept burning ; it must never go out . Each morning the priest will add fresh wood to the fire and arrange the burnt offering on it . He will then burn the fat of the peace offerings on it .
3:6:003:1	Further Instructions for the Grain Offering
3:6:013:0	Remember , the fire must be kept burning on the altar at all times . It must never go out .
3:6:014:0	“ These are the instructions regarding the grain offering . Aaron 's sons must present this offering to the Lord in front of the altar .
3:6:015:0	The priest on duty will take from the grain offering a handful of the choice flour moistened with olive oil , together with all the frankincense . He will burn this representative portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
3:6:016:0	Aaron and his sons may eat the rest of the flour , but it must be baked without yeast and eaten in a sacred place within the courtyard of the Tabernacle .
3:6:017:0	Remember , it must never be prepared with yeast . I have given it to the priests as their share of the special gifts presented to me . Like the sin offering and the guilt offering , it is most holy .
3:6:004:1	Procedures for the Ordination Offering
3:6:018:0	Any of Aaron 's male descendants may eat from the special gifts presented to the Lord . This is their permanent right from generation to generation . Anyone or anything that touches these offerings will become holy . ”
3:6:019:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:6:020:0	“ On the day Aaron and his sons are anointed , they must present to the Lord the standard grain offering of two quarts of choice flour , half to be offered in the morning and half to be offered in the evening .
3:6:021:0	It must be carefully mixed with olive oil and cooked on a griddle . Then slice this grain offering and present it as a pleasing aroma to the Lord .
3:6:022:0	In each generation , the high priest who succeeds Aaron must prepare this same offering . It belongs to the Lord and must be burned up completely . This is a permanent law .
3:6:005:1	Further Instructions for the Sin Offering
3:6:023:0	All such grain offerings of a priest must be burned up entirely . None of it may be eaten . ”
3:6:024:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:6:025:0	“ Give Aaron and his sons the following instructions regarding the sin offering . The animal given as an offering for sin is a most holy offering , and it must be slaughtered in the Lord 's presence at the place where the burnt offerings are slaughtered .
3:6:026:0	The priest who offers the sacrifice as a sin offering must eat his portion in a sacred place within the courtyard of the Tabernacle .
3:6:027:0	Anyone or anything that touches the sacrificial meat will become holy . If any of the sacrificial blood spatters on a person 's clothing , the soiled garment must be washed in a sacred place .
3:6:028:0	If a clay pot is used to boil the sacrificial meat , it must then be broken . If a bronze pot is used , it must be scoured and thoroughly rinsed with water .
3:6:029:0	Any male from a priest 's family may eat from this offering ; it is most holy .
3:6:030:0	But the offering for sin may not be eaten if its blood was brought into the Tabernacle as an offering for purification in the Holy Place . It must be completely burned with fire .
