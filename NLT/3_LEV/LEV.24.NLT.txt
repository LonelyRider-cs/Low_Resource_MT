3:24:001:1	Pure Oil and Holy Bread
3:24:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
3:24:002:0	“ Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light , to keep the lamps burning continually .
3:24:003:0	This is the lampstand that stands in the Tabernacle , in front of the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant . Aaron must keep the lamps burning in the Lord 's presence all night . This is a permanent law for you , and it must be observed from generation to generation .
3:24:004:0	Aaron and the priests must tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand continually in the Lord 's presence .
3:24:005:0	“ You must bake twelve flat loaves of bread from choice flour , using four quarts of flour for each loaf .
3:24:006:0	Place the bread before the Lord on the pure gold table , and arrange the loaves in two stacks , with six loaves in each stack .
3:24:007:0	Put some pure frankincense near each stack to serve as a representative offering , a special gift presented to the Lord .
3:24:008:0	Every Sabbath day this bread must be laid out before the Lord as a gift from the Israelites ; it is an ongoing expression of the eternal covenant .
3:24:002:1	An Example of Just Punishment
3:24:009:0	The loaves of bread will belong to Aaron and his descendants , who must eat them in a sacred place , for they are most holy . It is the permanent right of the priests to claim this portion of the special gifts presented to the Lord . ”
3:24:010:0	One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father came out of his tent and got into a fight with one of the Israelite men .
3:24:011:0	During the fight , this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the Name of the Lord with a curse . So the man was brought to Moses for judgment . His mother was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan .
3:24:012:0	They kept the man in custody until the Lord 's will in the matter should become clear to them .
3:24:013:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
3:24:014:0	“ Take the blasphemer outside the camp , and tell all those who heard the curse to lay their hands on his head . Then let the entire community stone him to death .
3:24:015:0	Say to the people of Israel : Those who curse their God will be punished for their sin .
3:24:016:0	Anyone who blasphemes the Name of the Lord must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel . Any native-born Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the Name of the Lord must be put to death .
3:24:017:0	“ Anyone who takes another person 's life must be put to death .
3:24:018:0	“ Anyone who kills another person 's animal must pay for it in full—a live animal for the animal that was killed .
3:24:019:0	“ Anyone who injures another person must be dealt with according to the injury inflicted—
3:24:020:0	a fracture for a fracture , an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . Whatever anyone does to injure another person must be paid back in kind .
3:24:021:0	“ Whoever kills an animal must pay for it in full , but whoever kills another person must be put to death .
3:24:022:0	“ This same standard applies both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you . I am the Lord your God . ”
3:24:023:0	After Moses gave all these instructions to the Israelites , they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him to death . The Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
