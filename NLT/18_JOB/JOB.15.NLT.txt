18:15:001:1	Eliphaz 's Second Response to Job
18:15:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied :
18:15:002:0	“ A wise man would n't answer with such empty talk ! You are nothing but a windbag .
18:15:003:0	The wise do n't engage in empty chatter.What good are such words ?
18:15:004:0	Have you no fear of God , no reverence for him ?
18:15:005:0	Your sins are telling your mouth what to say.Your words are based on clever deception .
18:15:006:0	Your own mouth condemns you , not I.Your own lips testify against you .
18:15:007:0	“ Were you the first person ever born ? Were you born before the hills were made ?
18:15:008:0	Were you listening at God 's secret council ? Do you have a monopoly on wisdom ?
18:15:009:0	What do you know that we do n't ? What do you understand that we do not ?
18:15:010:0	On our side are aged , gray-haired menmuch older than your father !
18:15:011:0	“ Is God 's comfort too little for you ? Is his gentle word not enough ?
18:15:012:0	What has taken away your reason ? What has weakened your vision ,
18:15:013:0	that you turn against Godand say all these evil things ?
18:15:014:0	Can any mortal be pure ? Can anyone born of a woman be just ?
18:15:015:0	Look , God does not even trust the angels.Even the heavens are not absolutely pure in his sight .
18:15:016:0	How much less pure is a corrupt and sinful personwith a thirst for wickedness !
18:15:017:0	“ If you will listen , I will show you.I will answer you from my own experience .
18:15:018:0	And it is confirmed by the reports of wise menwho have heard the same thing from their fathers—
18:15:019:0	from those to whom the land was givenlong before any foreigners arrived .
18:15:020:0	“ The wicked writhe in pain throughout their lives.Years of trouble are stored up for the ruthless .
18:15:021:0	The sound of terror rings in their ears , and even on good days they fear the attack of the destroyer .
18:15:022:0	They dare not go out into the darknessfor fear they will be murdered .
18:15:023:0	They wander around , saying , ‘ Where can I find bread ? 'They know their day of destruction is near .
18:15:024:0	That dark day terrifies them.They live in distress and anguish , like a king preparing for battle .
18:15:025:0	For they shake their fists at God , defying the Almighty .
18:15:026:0	Holding their strong shields , they defiantly charge against him .
18:15:027:0	“ These wicked people are heavy and prosperous ; their waists bulge with fat .
18:15:028:0	But their cities will be ruined.They will live in abandoned housesthat are ready to tumble down .
18:15:029:0	Their riches will not last , and their wealth will not endure.Their possessions will no longer spread across the horizon .
18:15:030:0	“ They will not escape the darkness.The burning sun will wither their shoots , and the breath of God will destroy them .
18:15:031:0	Let them no longer fool themselves by trusting in empty riches , for emptiness will be their only reward .
18:15:032:0	They will be cut down in the prime of life ; their branches will never again be green .
18:15:033:0	They will be like a vine whose grapes are harvested too early , like an olive tree that loses its blossoms before the fruit can form .
18:15:034:0	For the godless are barren.Their homes , enriched through bribery , will burn .
18:15:035:0	They conceive trouble and give birth to evil.Their womb produces deceit . ”
