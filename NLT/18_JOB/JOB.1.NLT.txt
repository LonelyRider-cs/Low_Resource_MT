18:1:001:1	Prologue
18:1:001:0	There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz . He was blameless — a man of complete integrity . He feared God and stayed away from evil .
18:1:002:0	He had seven sons and three daughters .
18:1:003:0	He owned 7,000 sheep , 3,000 camels , 500 teams of oxen , and 500 female donkeys . He also had many servants . He was , in fact , the richest person in that entire area .
18:1:004:0	Job 's sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes , and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them .
18:1:002:1	Job 's First Test
18:1:005:0	When these celebrations ended — sometimes after several days — Job would purify his children . He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them . For Job said to himself , “ Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts. ” This was Job 's regular practice .
18:1:006:0	One day the members of the heavenly court came to present themselves before the Lord , and the Accuser , Satan , came with them .
18:1:007:0	“ Where have you come from ? ” the Lord asked Satan.Satan answered the Lord , “ I have been patrolling the earth , watching everything that 's going on . ”
18:1:008:0	Then the Lord asked Satan , “ Have you noticed my servant Job ? He is the finest man in all the earth . He is blameless — a man of complete integrity . He fears God and stays away from evil . ”
18:1:009:0	Satan replied to the Lord , “ Yes , but Job has good reason to fear God .
18:1:010:0	You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property . You have made him prosper in everything he does . Look how rich he is !
18:1:011:0	But reach out and take away everything he has , and he will surely curse you to your face ! ”
18:1:012:0	“ All right , you may test him , ” the Lord said to Satan . “ Do whatever you want with everything he possesses , but do n't harm him physically. ” So Satan left the Lord 's presence .
18:1:013:0	One day when Job 's sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother 's house ,
18:1:014:0	a messenger arrived at Job 's home with this news : “ Your oxen were plowing , with the donkeys feeding beside them ,
18:1:015:0	when the Sabeans raided us . They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . ”
18:1:016:0	While he was still speaking , another messenger arrived with this news : “ The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . ”
18:1:017:0	While he was still speaking , a third messenger arrived with this news : “ Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . ”
18:1:018:0	While he was still speaking , another messenger arrived with this news : “ Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother 's home .
18:1:019:0	Suddenly , a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides . The house collapsed , and all your children are dead . I am the only one who escaped to tell you . ”
18:1:020:0	Job stood up and tore his robe in grief . Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship .
18:1:021:0	He said , “ I came naked from my mother 's womb , and I will be naked when I leave.The Lord gave me what I had , and the Lord has taken it away.Praise the name of the Lord ! ”
18:1:022:0	In all of this , Job did not sin by blaming God .
