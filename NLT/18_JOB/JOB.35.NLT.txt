18:35:001:1	Elihu Reminds Job of God 's Justice
18:35:001:0	Then Elihu said :
18:35:002:0	“ Do you think it is right for you to claim , ‘ I am righteous before God ' ?
18:35:003:0	For you also ask , ‘ What 's in it for me ? What 's the use of living a righteous life ? '
18:35:004:0	“ I will answer youand all your friends , too .
18:35:005:0	Look up into the sky , and see the clouds high above you .
18:35:006:0	If you sin , how does that affect God ? Even if you sin again and again , what effect will it have on him ?
18:35:007:0	If you are good , is this some great gift to him ? What could you possibly give him ?
18:35:008:0	No , your sins affect only people like yourself , and your good deeds also affect only humans .
18:35:009:0	“ People cry out when they are oppressed.They groan beneath the power of the mighty .
18:35:010:0	Yet they do n't ask , ‘ Where is God my Creator , the one who gives songs in the night ?
18:35:011:0	Where is the one who makes us smarter than the animalsand wiser than the birds of the sky ? '
18:35:012:0	And when they cry out , God does not answerbecause of their pride .
18:35:013:0	But it is wrong to say God does n't listen , to say the Almighty is n't concerned .
18:35:014:0	You say you ca n't see him , but he will bring justice if you will only wait .
18:35:015:0	You say he does not respond to sinners with angerand is not greatly concerned about wickedness .
18:35:016:0	But you are talking nonsense , Job.You have spoken like a fool . ”
