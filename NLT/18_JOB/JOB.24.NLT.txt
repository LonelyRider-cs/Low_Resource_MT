18:24:001:1	Job Asks Why the Wicked Are Not Punished
18:24:001:0	“ Why does n't the Almighty bring the wicked to judgment ? Why must the godly wait for him in vain ?
18:24:002:0	Evil people steal land by moving the boundary markers.They steal livestock and put them in their own pastures .
18:24:003:0	They take the orphan 's donkeyand demand the widow 's ox as security for a loan .
18:24:004:0	The poor are pushed off the path ; the needy must hide together for safety .
18:24:005:0	Like wild donkeys in the wilderness , the poor must spend all their time looking for food , searching even in the desert for food for their children .
18:24:006:0	They harvest a field they do not own , and they glean in the vineyards of the wicked .
18:24:007:0	All night they lie naked in the cold , without clothing or covering .
18:24:008:0	They are soaked by mountain showers , and they huddle against the rocks for want of a home .
18:24:009:0	“ The wicked snatch a widow 's child from her breast , taking the baby as security for a loan .
18:24:010:0	The poor must go about naked , without any clothing.They harvest food for others while they themselves are starving .
18:24:011:0	They press out olive oil without being allowed to taste it , and they tread in the winepress as they suffer from thirst .
18:24:012:0	The groans of the dying rise from the city , and the wounded cry for help , yet God ignores their moaning .
18:24:013:0	“ Wicked people rebel against the light.They refuse to acknowledge its waysor stay in its paths .
18:24:014:0	The murderer rises in the early dawnto kill the poor and needy ; at night he is a thief .
18:24:015:0	The adulterer waits for the twilight , saying , ‘ No one will see me then . 'He hides his face so no one will know him .
18:24:016:0	Thieves break into houses at nightand sleep in the daytime.They are not acquainted with the light .
18:24:017:0	The black night is their morning.They ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness .
18:24:018:0	“ But they disappear like foam down a river.Everything they own is cursed , and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards .
18:24:019:0	The grave consumes sinnersjust as drought and heat consume snow .
18:24:020:0	Their own mothers will forget them.Maggots will find them sweet to eat.No one will remember them.Wicked people are broken like a tree in the storm .
18:24:021:0	They cheat the woman who has no son to help her.They refuse to help the needy widow .
18:24:022:0	“ God , in his power , drags away the rich.They may rise high , but they have no assurance of life .
18:24:023:0	They may be allowed to live in security , but God is always watching them .
18:24:024:0	And though they are great now , in a moment they will be gone like all others , cut off like heads of grain .
18:24:025:0	Can anyone claim otherwise ? Who can prove me wrong ? ”
