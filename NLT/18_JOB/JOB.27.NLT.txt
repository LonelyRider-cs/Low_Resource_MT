18:27:001:1	Job 's Final Speech
18:27:001:0	Job continued speaking :
18:27:002:0	“ I vow by the living God , who has taken away my rights , by the Almighty who has embittered my soul—
18:27:003:0	As long as I live , while I have breath from God ,
18:27:004:0	my lips will speak no evil , and my tongue will speak no lies .
18:27:005:0	I will never concede that you are right ; I will defend my integrity until I die .
18:27:006:0	I will maintain my innocence without wavering.My conscience is clear for as long as I live .
18:27:007:0	“ May my enemy be punished like the wicked , my adversary like those who do evil .
18:27:008:0	For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them offand takes away their life ?
18:27:009:0	Will God listen to their crywhen trouble comes upon them ?
18:27:010:0	Can they take delight in the Almighty ? Can they call to God at any time ?
18:27:011:0	I will teach you about God 's power.I will not conceal anything concerning the Almighty .
18:27:012:0	But you have seen all this , yet you say all these useless things to me .
18:27:013:0	“ This is what the wicked will receive from God ; this is their inheritance from the Almighty .
18:27:014:0	They may have many children , but the children will die in war or starve to death .
18:27:015:0	Those who survive will die of a plague , and not even their widows will mourn them .
18:27:016:0	“ Evil people may have piles of moneyand may store away mounds of clothing .
18:27:017:0	But the righteous will wear that clothing , and the innocent will divide that money .
18:27:018:0	The wicked build houses as fragile as a spider 's web , as flimsy as a shelter made of branches .
18:27:019:0	The wicked go to bed richbut wake to find that all their wealth is gone .
18:27:020:0	Terror overwhelms them like a flood , and they are blown away in the storms of the night .
18:27:021:0	The east wind carries them away , and they are gone.It sweeps them away .
18:27:022:0	It whirls down on them without mercy.They struggle to flee from its power .
18:27:023:0	But everyone jeers at themand mocks them .
