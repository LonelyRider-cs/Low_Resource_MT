18:5:001:1	Eliphaz 's Response Continues
18:5:001:0	“ Cry for help , but will anyone answer you ? Which of the angels will help you ?
18:5:002:0	Surely resentment destroys the fool , and jealousy kills the simple .
18:5:003:0	I have seen that fools may be successful for the moment , but then comes sudden disaster .
18:5:004:0	Their children are abandoned far from help ; they are crushed in court with no one to defend them .
18:5:005:0	The hungry devour their harvest , even when it is guarded by brambles.The thirsty pant after their wealth .
18:5:006:0	But evil does not spring from the soil , and trouble does not sprout from the earth .
18:5:007:0	People are born for troubleas readily as sparks fly up from a fire .
18:5:008:0	“ If I were you , I would go to Godand present my case to him .
18:5:009:0	He does great things too marvelous to understand.He performs countless miracles .
18:5:010:0	He gives rain for the earthand water for the fields .
18:5:011:0	He gives prosperity to the poorand protects those who suffer .
18:5:012:0	He frustrates the plans of schemersso the work of their hands will not succeed .
18:5:013:0	He traps the wise in their own clevernessso their cunning schemes are thwarted .
18:5:014:0	They find it is dark in the daytime , and they grope at noon as if it were night .
18:5:015:0	He rescues the poor from the cutting words of the strong , and rescues them from the clutches of the powerful .
18:5:016:0	And so at last the poor have hope , and the snapping jaws of the wicked are shut .
18:5:017:0	“ But consider the joy of those corrected by God ! Do not despise the discipline of the Almighty when you sin .
18:5:018:0	For though he wounds , he also bandages.He strikes , but his hands also heal .
18:5:019:0	From six disasters he will rescue you ; even in the seventh , he will keep you from evil .
18:5:020:0	He will save you from death in time of famine , from the power of the sword in time of war .
18:5:021:0	You will be safe from slanderand have no fear when destruction comes .
18:5:022:0	You will laugh at destruction and famine ; wild animals will not terrify you .
18:5:023:0	You will be at peace with the stones of the field , and its wild animals will be at peace with you .
18:5:024:0	You will know that your home is safe.When you survey your possessions , nothing will be missing .
18:5:025:0	You will have many children ; your descendants will be as plentiful as grass !
18:5:026:0	You will go to the grave at a ripe old age , like a sheaf of grain harvested at the proper time !
18:5:027:0	“ We have studied life and found all this to be true.Listen to my counsel , and apply it to yourself . ”
