18:37:001:0	“ My heart pounds as I think of this.It trembles within me .
18:37:002:0	Listen carefully to the thunder of God 's voiceas it rolls from his mouth .
18:37:003:0	It rolls across the heavens , and his lightning flashes in every direction .
18:37:004:0	Then comes the roaring of the thunder—the tremendous voice of his majesty.He does not restrain it when he speaks .
18:37:005:0	God 's voice is glorious in the thunder.We ca n't even imagine the greatness of his power .
18:37:006:0	“ He directs the snow to fall on the earthand tells the rain to pour down .
18:37:007:0	Then everyone stops workingso they can watch his power .
18:37:008:0	The wild animals take coverand stay inside their dens .
18:37:009:0	The stormy wind comes from its chamber , and the driving winds bring the cold .
18:37:010:0	God 's breath sends the ice , freezing wide expanses of water .
18:37:011:0	He loads the clouds with moisture , and they flash with his lightning .
18:37:012:0	The clouds churn about at his direction.They do whatever he commands throughout the earth .
18:37:013:0	He makes these things happen either to punish peopleor to show his unfailing love .
18:37:014:0	“ Pay attention to this , Job.Stop and consider the wonderful miracles of God !
18:37:015:0	Do you know how God controls the stormand causes the lightning to flash from his clouds ?
18:37:016:0	Do you understand how he moves the cloudswith wonderful perfection and skill ?
18:37:017:0	When you are sweltering in your clothesand the south wind dies down and everything is still ,
18:37:018:0	he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror.Can you do that ?
18:37:019:0	“ So teach the rest of us what to say to God.We are too ignorant to make our own arguments .
18:37:020:0	Should God be notified that I want to speak ? Can people even speak when they are confused ?
18:37:021:0	We can not look at the sun , for it shines brightly in the skywhen the wind clears away the clouds .
18:37:022:0	So also , golden splendor comes from the mountain of God.He is clothed in dazzling splendor .
18:37:023:0	We can not imagine the power of the Almighty ; but even though he is just and righteous , he does not destroy us .
18:37:024:0	No wonder people everywhere fear him.All who are wise show him reverence . ”
