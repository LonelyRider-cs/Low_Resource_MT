18:3:001:1	Job 's First Speech
18:3:001:0	At last Job spoke , and he cursed the day of his birth .
18:3:002:0	He said :
18:3:003:0	“ Let the day of my birth be erased , and the night I was conceived .
18:3:004:0	Let that day be turned to darkness.Let it be lost even to God on high , and let no light shine on it .
18:3:005:0	Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own.Let a black cloud overshadow it , and let the darkness terrify it .
18:3:006:0	Let that night be blotted off the calendar , never again to be counted among the days of the year , never again to appear among the months .
18:3:007:0	Let that night be childless.Let it have no joy .
18:3:008:0	Let those who are experts at cursing—whose cursing could rouse Leviathan—curse that day .
18:3:009:0	Let its morning stars remain dark.Let it hope for light , but in vain ; may it never see the morning light .
18:3:010:0	Curse that day for failing to shut my mother 's womb , for letting me be born to see all this trouble .
18:3:011:0	“ Why was n't I born dead ? Why did n't I die as I came from the womb ?
18:3:012:0	Why was I laid on my mother 's lap ? Why did she nurse me at her breasts ?
18:3:013:0	Had I died at birth , I would now be at peace.I would be asleep and at rest .
18:3:014:0	I would rest with the world 's kings and prime ministers , whose great buildings now lie in ruins .
18:3:015:0	I would rest with princes , rich in gold , whose palaces were filled with silver .
18:3:016:0	Why was n't I buried like a stillborn child , like a baby who never lives to see the light ?
18:3:017:0	For in death the wicked cause no trouble , and the weary are at rest .
18:3:018:0	Even captives are at ease in death , with no guards to curse them .
18:3:019:0	Rich and poor are both there , and the slave is free from his master .
18:3:020:0	“ Oh , why give light to those in misery , and life to those who are bitter ?
18:3:021:0	They long for death , and it wo n't come.They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure .
18:3:022:0	They 're filled with joy when they finally die , and rejoice when they find the grave .
18:3:023:0	Why is life given to those with no future , those God has surrounded with difficulties ?
18:3:024:0	I can not eat for sighing ; my groans pour out like water .
18:3:025:0	What I always feared has happened to me.What I dreaded has come true .
18:3:026:0	I have no peace , no quietness.I have no rest ; only trouble comes . ”
