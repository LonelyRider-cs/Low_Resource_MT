18:14:001:0	“ How frail is humanity ! How short is life , how full of trouble !
18:14:002:0	We blossom like a flower and then wither.Like a passing shadow , we quickly disappear .
18:14:003:0	Must you keep an eye on such a frail creatureand demand an accounting from me ?
18:14:004:0	Who can bring purity out of an impure person ? No one !
18:14:005:0	You have decided the length of our lives.You know how many months we will live , and we are not given a minute longer .
18:14:006:0	So leave us alone and let us rest ! We are like hired hands , so let us finish our work in peace .
18:14:007:0	“ Even a tree has more hope ! If it is cut down , it will sprout againand grow new branches .
18:14:008:0	Though its roots have grown old in the earthand its stump decays ,
18:14:009:0	at the scent of water it will budand sprout again like a new seedling .
18:14:010:0	“ But when people die , their strength is gone.They breathe their last , and then where are they ?
18:14:011:0	As water evaporates from a lakeand a river disappears in drought ,
18:14:012:0	people are laid to rest and do not rise again.Until the heavens are no more , they will not wake upnor be roused from their sleep .
18:14:013:0	“ I wish you would hide me in the graveand forget me there until your anger has passed.But mark your calendar to think of me again !
18:14:014:0	Can the dead live again ? If so , this would give me hope through all my years of struggle , and I would eagerly await the release of death .
18:14:015:0	You would call and I would answer , and you would yearn for me , your handiwork .
18:14:016:0	For then you would guard my steps , instead of watching for my sins .
18:14:017:0	My sins would be sealed in a pouch , and you would cover my guilt .
18:14:018:0	“ But instead , as mountains fall and crumbleand as rocks fall from a cliff ,
18:14:019:0	as water wears away the stonesand floods wash away the soil , so you destroy people 's hope .
18:14:020:0	You always overpower them , and they pass from the scene.You disfigure them in death and send them away .
18:14:021:0	They never know if their children grow up in honoror sink to insignificance .
18:14:022:0	They suffer painfully ; their life is full of trouble . ”
