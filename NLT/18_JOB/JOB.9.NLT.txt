18:9:001:1	Job 's Third Speech : A Response to Bildad
18:9:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:9:002:0	“ Yes , I know all this is true in principle.But how can a person be declared innocent in God 's sight ?
18:9:003:0	If someone wanted to take God to court , would it be possible to answer him even once in a thousand times ?
18:9:004:0	For God is so wise and so mighty.Who has ever challenged him successfully ?
18:9:005:0	“ Without warning , he moves the mountains , overturning them in his anger .
18:9:006:0	He shakes the earth from its place , and its foundations tremble .
18:9:007:0	If he commands it , the sun wo n't riseand the stars wo n't shine .
18:9:008:0	He alone has spread out the heavensand marches on the waves of the sea .
18:9:009:0	He made all the stars—the Bear and Orion , the Pleiades and the constellations of the southern sky .
18:9:010:0	He does great things too marvelous to understand.He performs countless miracles .
18:9:011:0	“ Yet when he comes near , I can not see him.When he moves by , I do not see him go .
18:9:012:0	If he snatches someone in death , who can stop him ? Who dares to ask , ‘ What are you doing ? '
18:9:013:0	And God does not restrain his anger.Even the monsters of the sea are crushed beneath his feet .
18:9:014:0	“ So who am I , that I should try to answer Godor even reason with him ?
18:9:015:0	Even if I were right , I would have no defense.I could only plead for mercy .
18:9:016:0	And even if I summoned him and he responded , I 'm not sure he would listen to me .
18:9:017:0	For he attacks me with a stormand repeatedly wounds me without cause .
18:9:018:0	He will not let me catch my breath , but fills me instead with bitter sorrows .
18:9:019:0	If it 's a question of strength , he 's the strong one.If it 's a matter of justice , who dares to summon him to court ?
18:9:020:0	Though I am innocent , my own mouth would pronounce me guilty.Though I am blameless , it would prove me wicked .
18:9:021:0	“ I am innocent , but it makes no difference to me—I despise my life .
18:9:022:0	Innocent or wicked , it is all the same to God.That 's why I say , ‘ He destroys both the blameless and the wicked . '
18:9:023:0	When a plague sweeps through , he laughs at the death of the innocent .
18:9:024:0	The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked , and God blinds the eyes of the judges.If he 's not the one who does it , who is ?
18:9:025:0	“ My life passes more swiftly than a runner.It flees away without a glimpse of happiness .
18:9:026:0	It disappears like a swift papyrus boat , like an eagle swooping down on its prey .
18:9:027:0	If I decided to forget my complaints , to put away my sad face and be cheerful ,
18:9:028:0	I would still dread all the pain , for I know you will not find me innocent , O God .
18:9:029:0	Whatever happens , I will be found guilty.So what 's the use of trying ?
18:9:030:0	Even if I were to wash myself with soapand clean my hands with lye ,
18:9:031:0	you would plunge me into a muddy ditch , and my own filthy clothing would hate me .
18:9:032:0	“ God is not a mortal like me , so I can not argue with him or take him to trial .
18:9:033:0	If only there were a mediator between us , someone who could bring us together .
18:9:034:0	The mediator could make God stop beating me , and I would no longer live in terror of his punishment .
18:9:035:0	Then I could speak to him without fear , but I can not do that in my own strength .
