18:38:001:1	The
18:38:002:1	Lord
18:38:003:1	Challenges Job
18:38:001:0	Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind :
18:38:002:0	“ Who is this that questions my wisdomwith such ignorant words ?
18:38:003:0	Brace yourself like a man , because I have some questions for you , and you must answer them .
18:38:004:0	“ Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ? Tell me , if you know so much .
18:38:005:0	Who determined its dimensionsand stretched out the surveying line ?
18:38:006:0	What supports its foundations , and who laid its cornerstone
18:38:007:0	as the morning stars sang togetherand all the angels shouted for joy ?
18:38:008:0	“ Who kept the sea inside its boundariesas it burst from the womb ,
18:38:009:0	and as I clothed it with cloudsand wrapped it in thick darkness ?
18:38:010:0	For I locked it behind barred gates , limiting its shores .
18:38:011:0	I said , ‘ This far and no farther will you come.Here your proud waves must stop ! '
18:38:012:0	“ Have you ever commanded the morning to appearand caused the dawn to rise in the east ?
18:38:013:0	Have you made daylight spread to the ends of the earth , to bring an end to the night 's wickedness ?
18:38:014:0	As the light approaches , the earth takes shape like clay pressed beneath a seal ; it is robed in brilliant colors .
18:38:015:0	The light disturbs the wickedand stops the arm that is raised in violence .
18:38:016:0	“ Have you explored the springs from which the seas come ? Have you explored their depths ?
18:38:017:0	Do you know where the gates of death are located ? Have you seen the gates of utter gloom ?
18:38:018:0	Do you realize the extent of the earth ? Tell me about it if you know !
18:38:019:0	“ Where does light come from , and where does darkness go ?
18:38:020:0	Can you take each to its home ? Do you know how to get there ?
18:38:021:0	But of course you know all this ! For you were born before it was all created , and you are so very experienced !
18:38:022:0	“ Have you visited the storehouses of the snowor seen the storehouses of hail ?
18:38:023:0	( I have reserved them as weapons for the time of trouble , for the day of battle and war . )
18:38:024:0	Where is the path to the source of light ? Where is the home of the east wind ?
18:38:025:0	“ Who created a channel for the torrents of rain ? Who laid out the path for the lightning ?
18:38:026:0	Who makes the rain fall on barren land , in a desert where no one lives ?
18:38:027:0	Who sends rain to satisfy the parched groundand make the tender grass spring up ?
18:38:028:0	“ Does the rain have a father ? Who gives birth to the dew ?
18:38:029:0	Who is the mother of the ice ? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens ?
18:38:030:0	For the water turns to ice as hard as rock , and the surface of the water freezes .
18:38:031:0	“ Can you direct the movement of the stars—binding the cluster of the Pleiadesor loosening the cords of Orion ?
18:38:032:0	Can you direct the constellations through the seasonsor guide the Bear with her cubs across the heavens ?
18:38:033:0	Do you know the laws of the universe ? Can you use them to regulate the earth ?
18:38:034:0	“ Can you shout to the cloudsand make it rain ?
18:38:035:0	Can you make lightning appearand cause it to strike as you direct ?
18:38:036:0	Who gives intuition to the heartand instinct to the mind ?
18:38:037:0	Who is wise enough to count all the clouds ? Who can tilt the water jars of heaven
18:38:038:0	when the parched ground is dryand the soil has hardened into clods ?
18:38:039:0	“ Can you stalk prey for a lionessand satisfy the young lions ' appetites
18:38:040:0	as they lie in their densor crouch in the thicket ?
18:38:041:0	Who provides food for the ravenswhen their young cry out to Godand wander about in hunger ?
