18:17:001:1	Job Continues to Defend His Innocence
18:17:001:0	“ My spirit is crushed , and my life is nearly snuffed out.The grave is ready to receive me .
18:17:002:0	I am surrounded by mockers.I watch how bitterly they taunt me .
18:17:003:0	“ You must defend my innocence , O God , since no one else will stand up for me .
18:17:004:0	You have closed their minds to understanding , but do not let them triumph .
18:17:005:0	They betray their friends for their own advantage , so let their children faint with hunger .
18:17:006:0	“ God has made a mockery of me among the people ; they spit in my face .
18:17:007:0	My eyes are swollen with weeping , and I am but a shadow of my former self .
18:17:008:0	The virtuous are horrified when they see me.The innocent rise up against the ungodly .
18:17:009:0	The righteous keep moving forward , and those with clean hands become stronger and stronger .
18:17:010:0	“ As for all of you , come back with a better argument , though I still wo n't find a wise man among you .
18:17:011:0	My days are over.My hopes have disappeared.My heart 's desires are broken .
18:17:012:0	These men say that night is day ; they claim that the darkness is light .
18:17:013:0	What if I go to the graveand make my bed in darkness ?
18:17:014:0	What if I call the grave my father , and the maggot my mother or my sister ?
18:17:015:0	Where then is my hope ? Can anyone find it ?
18:17:016:0	No , my hope will go down with me to the grave.We will rest together in the dust ! ”
