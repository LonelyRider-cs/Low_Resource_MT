18:40:001:0	Then the Lord said to Job ,
18:40:001:1	Job Responds to the
18:40:002:1	Lord
18:40:002:0	“ Do you still want to argue with the Almighty ? You are God 's critic , but do you have the answers ? ”
18:40:003:0	Then Job replied to the Lord ,
18:40:004:0	“ I am nothing—how could I ever find the answers ? I will cover my mouth with my hand .
18:40:003:1	The
18:40:004:1	Lord
18:40:005:1	Challenges Job Again
18:40:005:0	I have said too much already.I have nothing more to say . ”
18:40:006:0	Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind :
18:40:007:0	“ Brace yourself like a man , because I have some questions for you , and you must answer them .
18:40:008:0	“ Will you discredit my justiceand condemn me just to prove you are right ?
18:40:009:0	Are you as strong as God ? Can you thunder with a voice like his ?
18:40:010:0	All right , put on your glory and splendor , your honor and majesty .
18:40:011:0	Give vent to your anger.Let it overflow against the proud .
18:40:012:0	Humiliate the proud with a glance ; walk on the wicked where they stand .
18:40:013:0	Bury them in the dust.Imprison them in the world of the dead .
18:40:014:0	Then even I would praise you , for your own strength would save you .
18:40:015:0	“ Take a look at Behemoth , which I made , just as I made you.It eats grass like an ox .
18:40:016:0	See its powerful loinsand the muscles of its belly .
18:40:017:0	Its tail is as strong as a cedar.The sinews of its thighs are knit tightly together .
18:40:018:0	Its bones are tubes of bronze.Its limbs are bars of iron .
18:40:019:0	It is a prime example of God 's handiwork , and only its Creator can threaten it .
18:40:020:0	The mountains offer it their best food , where all the wild animals play .
18:40:021:0	It lies under the lotus plants , hidden by the reeds in the marsh .
18:40:022:0	The lotus plants give it shadeamong the willows beside the stream .
18:40:023:0	It is not disturbed by the raging river , not concerned when the swelling Jordan rushes around it .
18:40:024:0	No one can catch it off guardor put a ring in its nose and lead it away .
