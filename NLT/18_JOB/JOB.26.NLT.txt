18:26:001:1	Job 's Ninth Speech : A Response to Bildad
18:26:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:26:002:0	“ How you have helped the powerless ! How you have saved the weak !
18:26:003:0	How you have enlightened my stupidity ! What wise advice you have offered !
18:26:004:0	Where have you gotten all these wise sayings ? Whose spirit speaks through you ?
18:26:005:0	“ The dead tremble — those who live beneath the waters .
18:26:006:0	The underworld is naked in God 's presence.The place of destruction is uncovered .
18:26:007:0	God stretches the northern sky over empty spaceand hangs the earth on nothing .
18:26:008:0	He wraps the rain in his thick clouds , and the clouds do n't burst with the weight .
18:26:009:0	He covers the face of the moon , shrouding it with his clouds .
18:26:010:0	He created the horizon when he separated the waters ; he set the boundary between day and night .
18:26:011:0	The foundations of heaven tremble ; they shudder at his rebuke .
18:26:012:0	By his power the sea grew calm.By his skill he crushed the great sea monster .
18:26:013:0	His Spirit made the heavens beautiful , and his power pierced the gliding serpent .
18:26:014:0	These are just the beginning of all that he does , merely a whisper of his power.Who , then , can comprehend the thunder of his power ? ”
