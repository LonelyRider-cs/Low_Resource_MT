18:25:001:0	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied :
18:25:002:0	“ God is powerful and dreadful.He enforces peace in the heavens .
18:25:003:0	Who is able to count his heavenly army ? Does n't his light shine on all the earth ?
18:25:004:0	How can a mortal be innocent before God ? Can anyone born of a woman be pure ?
18:25:005:0	God is more glorious than the moon ; he shines brighter than the stars .
18:25:006:0	In comparison , people are maggots ; we mortals are mere worms . ”
