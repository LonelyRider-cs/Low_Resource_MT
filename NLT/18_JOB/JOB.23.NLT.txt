18:23:001:1	Job 's Eighth Speech : A Response to Eliphaz
18:23:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:23:002:0	“ My complaint today is still a bitter one , and I try hard not to groan aloud .
18:23:003:0	If only I knew where to find God , I would go to his court .
18:23:004:0	I would lay out my caseand present my arguments .
18:23:005:0	Then I would listen to his replyand understand what he says to me .
18:23:006:0	Would he use his great power to argue with me ? No , he would give me a fair hearing .
18:23:007:0	Honest people can reason with him , so I would be forever acquitted by my judge .
18:23:008:0	I go east , but he is not there.I go west , but I can not find him .
18:23:009:0	I do not see him in the north , for he is hidden.I look to the south , but he is concealed .
18:23:010:0	“ But he knows where I am going.And when he tests me , I will come out as pure as gold .
18:23:011:0	For I have stayed on God 's paths ; I have followed his ways and not turned aside .
18:23:012:0	I have not departed from his commands , but have treasured his words more than daily food .
18:23:013:0	But once he has made his decision , who can change his mind ? Whatever he wants to do , he does .
18:23:014:0	So he will do to me whatever he has planned.He controls my destiny .
18:23:015:0	No wonder I am so terrified in his presence.When I think of it , terror grips me .
18:23:016:0	God has made me sick at heart ; the Almighty has terrified me .
18:23:017:0	Darkness is all around me ; thick , impenetrable darkness is everywhere .
