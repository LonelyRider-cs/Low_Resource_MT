18:28:001:1	Job Speaks of Wisdom and Understanding
18:28:001:0	“ People know where to mine silverand how to refine gold .
18:28:002:0	They know where to dig iron from the earthand how to smelt copper from rock .
18:28:003:0	They know how to shine light in the darknessand explore the farthest regions of the earthas they search in the dark for ore .
18:28:004:0	They sink a mine shaft into the earthfar from where anyone lives.They descend on ropes , swinging back and forth .
18:28:005:0	Food is grown on the earth above , but down below , the earth is melted as by fire .
18:28:006:0	Here the rocks contain precious lapis lazuli , and the dust contains gold .
18:28:007:0	These are treasures no bird of prey can see , no falcon 's eye observe .
18:28:008:0	No wild animal has walked upon these treasures ; no lion has ever set his paw there .
18:28:009:0	People know how to tear apart flinty rocksand overturn the roots of mountains .
18:28:010:0	They cut tunnels in the rocksand uncover precious stones .
18:28:011:0	They dam up the trickling streamsand bring to light the hidden treasures .
18:28:012:0	“ But do people know where to find wisdom ? Where can they find understanding ?
18:28:013:0	No one knows where to find it , for it is not found among the living .
18:28:014:0	‘ It is not here , ' says the ocean. ‘ Nor is it here , ' says the sea .
18:28:015:0	It can not be bought with gold.It can not be purchased with silver .
18:28:016:0	It 's worth more than all the gold of Ophir , greater than precious onyx or lapis lazuli .
18:28:017:0	Wisdom is more valuable than gold and crystal.It can not be purchased with jewels mounted in fine gold .
18:28:018:0	Coral and jasper are worthless in trying to get it.The price of wisdom is far above rubies .
18:28:019:0	Precious peridot from Ethiopia can not be exchanged for it.It 's worth more than the purest gold .
18:28:020:0	“ But do people know where to find wisdom ? Where can they find understanding ?
18:28:021:0	It is hidden from the eyes of all humanity.Even the sharp-eyed birds in the sky can not discover it .
18:28:022:0	Destruction and Death say , ‘ We 've heard only rumors of where wisdom can be found . '
18:28:023:0	“ God alone understands the way to wisdom ; he knows where it can be found ,
18:28:024:0	for he looks throughout the whole earthand sees everything under the heavens .
18:28:025:0	He decided how hard the winds should blowand how much rain should fall .
18:28:026:0	He made the laws for the rainand laid out a path for the lightning .
18:28:027:0	Then he saw wisdom and evaluated it.He set it in place and examined it thoroughly .
18:28:028:0	And this is what he says to all humanity : ‘ The fear of the Lord is true wisdom ; to forsake evil is real understanding . ' ”
