18:34:001:1	Elihu Accuses Job of Arrogance
18:34:001:0	Then Elihu said :
18:34:002:0	“ Listen to me , you wise men.Pay attention , you who have knowledge .
18:34:003:0	Job said , ‘ The ear tests the words it hearsjust as the mouth distinguishes between foods . '
18:34:004:0	So let us discern for ourselves what is right ; let us learn together what is good .
18:34:005:0	For Job also said , ‘ I am innocent , but God has taken away my rights .
18:34:006:0	I am innocent , but they call me a liar.My suffering is incurable , though I have not sinned . '
18:34:007:0	“ Tell me , has there ever been a man like Job , with his thirst for irreverent talk ?
18:34:008:0	He chooses evil people as companions.He spends his time with wicked men .
18:34:009:0	He has even said , ‘ Why waste timetrying to please God ? '
18:34:010:0	“ Listen to me , you who have understanding.Everyone knows that God does n't sin ! The Almighty can do no wrong .
18:34:011:0	He repays people according to their deeds.He treats people as they deserve .
18:34:012:0	Truly , God will not do wrong.The Almighty will not twist justice .
18:34:013:0	Did someone else put the world in his care ? Who set the whole world in place ?
18:34:014:0	If God were to take back his spiritand withdraw his breath ,
18:34:015:0	all life would cease , and humanity would turn again to dust .
18:34:016:0	“ Now listen to me if you are wise.Pay attention to what I say .
18:34:017:0	Could God govern if he hated justice ? Are you going to condemn the almighty judge ?
18:34:018:0	For he says to kings , ‘ You are wicked , 'and to nobles , ‘ You are unjust . '
18:34:019:0	He does n't care how great a person may be , and he pays no more attention to the rich than to the poor.He made them all .
18:34:020:0	In a moment they die.In the middle of the night they pass away ; the mighty are removed without human hand .
18:34:021:0	“ For God watches how people live ; he sees everything they do .
18:34:022:0	No darkness is thick enoughto hide the wicked from his eyes .
18:34:023:0	We do n't set the timewhen we will come before God in judgment .
18:34:024:0	He brings the mighty to ruin without asking anyone , and he sets up others in their place .
18:34:025:0	He knows what they do , and in the night he overturns and destroys them .
18:34:026:0	He strikes them down because they are wicked , doing it openly for all to see .
18:34:027:0	For they turned away from following him.They have no respect for any of his ways .
18:34:028:0	They cause the poor to cry out , catching God 's attention.He hears the cries of the needy .
18:34:029:0	But if he chooses to remain quiet , who can criticize him ? When he hides his face , no one can find him , whether an individual or a nation .
18:34:030:0	He prevents the godless from rulingso they can not be a snare to the people .
18:34:031:0	“ Why do n't people say to God , ‘ I have sinned , but I will sin no more ' ?
18:34:032:0	Or ‘ I do n't know what evil I have done — tell me.If I have done wrong , I will stop at once ' ?
18:34:033:0	“ Must God tailor his justice to your demands ? But you have rejected him ! The choice is yours , not mine.Go ahead , share your wisdom with us .
18:34:034:0	After all , bright people will tell me , and wise people will hear me say ,
18:34:035:0	‘ Job speaks out of ignorance ; his words lack insight . '
18:34:036:0	Job , you deserve the maximum penaltyfor the wicked way you have talked .
18:34:037:0	For you have added rebellion to your sin ; you show no respect , and you speak many angry words against God . ”
