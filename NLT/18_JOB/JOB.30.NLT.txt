18:30:001:1	Job Speaks of His Anguish
18:30:001:0	“ But now I am mocked by people younger than I , by young men whose fathers are not worthy to run with my sheepdogs .
18:30:002:0	A lot of good they are to me—those worn-out wretches !
18:30:003:0	They are gaunt from poverty and hunger.They claw the dry ground in desolate wastelands .
18:30:004:0	They pluck wild greens from among the bushesand eat from the roots of broom trees .
18:30:005:0	They are driven from human society , and people shout at them as if they were thieves .
18:30:006:0	So now they live in frightening ravines , in caves and among the rocks .
18:30:007:0	They sound like animals howling among the bushes , huddled together beneath the nettles .
18:30:008:0	They are nameless fools , outcasts from society .
18:30:009:0	“ And now they mock me with vulgar songs ! They taunt me !
18:30:010:0	They despise me and wo n't come near me , except to spit in my face .
18:30:011:0	For God has cut my bowstring.He has humbled me , so they have thrown off all restraint .
18:30:012:0	These outcasts oppose me to my face.They send me sprawlingand lay traps in my path .
18:30:013:0	They block my roadand do everything they can to destroy me.They know I have no one to help me .
18:30:014:0	They come at me from all directions.They jump on me when I am down .
18:30:015:0	I live in terror now.My honor has blown away in the wind , and my prosperity has vanished like a cloud .
18:30:016:0	“ And now my life seeps away.Depression haunts my days .
18:30:017:0	At night my bones are filled with pain , which gnaws at me relentlessly .
18:30:018:0	With a strong hand , God grabs my shirt.He grips me by the collar of my coat .
18:30:019:0	He has thrown me into the mud.I 'm nothing more than dust and ashes .
18:30:020:0	“ I cry to you , O God , but you do n't answer.I stand before you , but you do n't even look .
18:30:021:0	You have become cruel toward me.You use your power to persecute me .
18:30:022:0	You throw me into the whirlwindand destroy me in the storm .
18:30:023:0	And I know you are sending me to my death—the destination of all who live .
18:30:024:0	“ Surely no one would turn against the needywhen they cry for help in their trouble .
18:30:025:0	Did I not weep for those in trouble ? Was I not deeply grieved for the needy ?
18:30:026:0	So I looked for good , but evil came instead.I waited for the light , but darkness fell .
18:30:027:0	My heart is troubled and restless.Days of suffering torment me .
18:30:028:0	I walk in gloom , without sunlight.I stand in the public square and cry for help .
18:30:029:0	Instead , I am considered a brother to jackalsand a companion to owls .
18:30:030:0	My skin has turned dark , and my bones burn with fever .
18:30:031:0	My harp plays sad music , and my flute accompanies those who weep .
