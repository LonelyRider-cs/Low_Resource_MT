18:29:001:0	Job continued speaking :
18:29:002:0	“ I long for the years gone bywhen God took care of me ,
18:29:003:0	when he lit up the way before meand I walked safely through the darkness .
18:29:004:0	When I was in my prime , God 's friendship was felt in my home .
18:29:005:0	The Almighty was still with me , and my children were around me .
18:29:006:0	My steps were awash in cream , and the rocks gushed olive oil for me .
18:29:007:0	“ Those were the days when I went to the city gateand took my place among the honored leaders .
18:29:008:0	The young stepped aside when they saw me , and even the aged rose in respect at my coming .
18:29:009:0	The princes stood in silenceand put their hands over their mouths .
18:29:010:0	The highest officials of the city stood quietly , holding their tongues in respect .
18:29:011:0	“ All who heard me praised me.All who saw me spoke well of me .
18:29:012:0	For I assisted the poor in their needand the orphans who required help .
18:29:013:0	I helped those without hope , and they blessed me.And I caused the widows ' hearts to sing for joy .
18:29:014:0	Everything I did was honest.Righteousness covered me like a robe , and I wore justice like a turban .
18:29:015:0	I served as eyes for the blindand feet for the lame .
18:29:016:0	I was a father to the poorand assisted strangers who needed help .
18:29:017:0	I broke the jaws of godless oppressorsand plucked their victims from their teeth .
18:29:018:0	“ I thought , ‘ Surely I will die surrounded by my familyafter a long , good life .
18:29:019:0	For I am like a tree whose roots reach the water , whose branches are refreshed with the dew .
18:29:020:0	New honors are constantly bestowed on me , and my strength is continually renewed . '
18:29:021:0	“ Everyone listened to my advice.They were silent as they waited for me to speak .
18:29:022:0	And after I spoke , they had nothing to add , for my counsel satisfied them .
18:29:023:0	They longed for me to speak as people long for rain.They drank my words like a refreshing spring rain .
18:29:024:0	When they were discouraged , I smiled at them.My look of approval was precious to them .
18:29:025:0	Like a chief , I told them what to do.I lived like a king among his troopsand comforted those who mourned .
