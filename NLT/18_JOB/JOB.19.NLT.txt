18:19:001:1	Job 's Sixth Speech : A Response to Bildad
18:19:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:19:002:0	“ How long will you torture me ? How long will you try to crush me with your words ?
18:19:003:0	You have already insulted me ten times.You should be ashamed of treating me so badly .
18:19:004:0	Even if I have sinned , that is my concern , not yours .
18:19:005:0	You think you 're better than I am , using my humiliation as evidence of my sin .
18:19:006:0	But it is God who has wronged me , capturing me in his net .
18:19:007:0	“ I cry out , ‘ Help ! ' but no one answers me.I protest , but there is no justice .
18:19:008:0	God has blocked my way so I can not move.He has plunged my path into darkness .
18:19:009:0	He has stripped me of my honorand removed the crown from my head .
18:19:010:0	He has demolished me on every side , and I am finished.He has uprooted my hope like a fallen tree .
18:19:011:0	His fury burns against me ; he counts me as an enemy .
18:19:012:0	His troops advance.They build up roads to attack me.They camp all around my tent .
18:19:013:0	“ My relatives stay far away , and my friends have turned against me .
18:19:014:0	My family is gone , and my close friends have forgotten me .
18:19:015:0	My servants and maids consider me a stranger.I am like a foreigner to them .
18:19:016:0	When I call my servant , he does n't come ; I have to plead with him !
18:19:017:0	My breath is repulsive to my wife.I am rejected by my own family .
18:19:018:0	Even young children despise me.When I stand to speak , they turn their backs on me .
18:19:019:0	My close friends detest me.Those I loved have turned against me .
18:19:020:0	I have been reduced to skin and bonesand have escaped death by the skin of my teeth .
18:19:021:0	“ Have mercy on me , my friends , have mercy , for the hand of God has struck me .
18:19:022:0	Must you also persecute me , like God does ? Have n't you chewed me up enough ?
18:19:023:0	“ Oh , that my words could be recorded.Oh , that they could be inscribed on a monument ,
18:19:024:0	carved with an iron chisel and filled with lead , engraved forever in the rock .
18:19:025:0	“ But as for me , I know that my Redeemer lives , and he will stand upon the earth at last .
18:19:026:0	And after my body has decayed , yet in my body I will see God !
18:19:027:0	I will see him for myself.Yes , I will see him with my own eyes.I am overwhelmed at the thought !
18:19:028:0	“ How dare you go on persecuting me , saying , ‘ It 's his own fault ' ?
18:19:029:0	You should fear punishment yourselves , for your attitude deserves punishment.Then you will know that there is indeed a judgment . ”
