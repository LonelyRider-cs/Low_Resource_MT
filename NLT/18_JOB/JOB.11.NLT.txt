18:11:001:1	Zophar 's First Response to Job
18:11:001:0	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied to Job :
18:11:002:0	“ Should n't someone answer this torrent of words ? Is a person proved innocent just by a lot of talking ?
18:11:003:0	Should I remain silent while you babble on ? When you mock God , should n't someone make you ashamed ?
18:11:004:0	You claim , ‘ My beliefs are pure , 'and ‘ I am clean in the sight of God . '
18:11:005:0	If only God would speak ; if only he would tell you what he thinks !
18:11:006:0	If only he would tell you the secrets of wisdom , for true wisdom is not a simple matter.Listen ! God is doubtless punishing youfar less than you deserve !
18:11:007:0	“ Can you solve the mysteries of God ? Can you discover everything about the Almighty ?
18:11:008:0	Such knowledge is higher than the heavens — and who are you ? It is deeper than the underworld — what do you know ?
18:11:009:0	It is broader than the earthand wider than the sea .
18:11:010:0	If God comes and puts a person in prisonor calls the court to order , who can stop him ?
18:11:011:0	For he knows those who are false , and he takes note of all their sins .
18:11:012:0	An empty-headed person wo n't become wiseany more than a wild donkey can bear a human child .
18:11:013:0	“ If only you would prepare your heartand lift up your hands to him in prayer !
18:11:014:0	Get rid of your sins , and leave all iniquity behind you .
18:11:015:0	Then your face will brighten with innocence.You will be strong and free of fear .
18:11:016:0	You will forget your misery ; it will be like water flowing away .
18:11:017:0	Your life will be brighter than the noonday.Even darkness will be as bright as morning .
18:11:018:0	Having hope will give you courage.You will be protected and will rest in safety .
18:11:019:0	You will lie down unafraid , and many will look to you for help .
18:11:020:0	But the wicked will be blinded.They will have no escape.Their only hope is death . ”
