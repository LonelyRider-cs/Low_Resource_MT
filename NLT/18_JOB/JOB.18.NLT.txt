18:18:001:1	Bildad 's Second Response to Job
18:18:001:0	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied :
18:18:002:0	“ How long before you stop talking ? Speak sense if you want us to answer !
18:18:003:0	Do you think we are mere animals ? Do you think we are stupid ?
18:18:004:0	You may tear out your hair in anger , but will that destroy the earth ? Will it make the rocks tremble ?
18:18:005:0	“ Surely the light of the wicked will be snuffed out.The sparks of their fire will not glow .
18:18:006:0	The light in their tent will grow dark.The lamp hanging above them will be quenched .
18:18:007:0	The confident stride of the wicked will be shortened.Their own schemes will be their downfall .
18:18:008:0	The wicked walk into a net.They fall into a pit .
18:18:009:0	A trap grabs them by the heel.A snare holds them tight .
18:18:010:0	A noose lies hidden on the ground.A rope is stretched across their path .
18:18:011:0	“ Terrors surround the wickedand trouble them at every step .
18:18:012:0	Hunger depletes their strength , and calamity waits for them to stumble .
18:18:013:0	Disease eats their skin ; death devours their limbs .
18:18:014:0	They are torn from the security of their homesand are brought down to the king of terrors .
18:18:015:0	The homes of the wicked will burn down ; burning sulfur rains on their houses .
18:18:016:0	Their roots will dry up , and their branches will wither .
18:18:017:0	All memory of their existence will fade from the earth ; no one will remember their names .
18:18:018:0	They will be thrust from light into darkness , driven from the world .
18:18:019:0	They will have neither children nor grandchildren , nor any survivor in the place where they lived .
18:18:020:0	People in the west are appalled at their fate ; people in the east are horrified .
18:18:021:0	They will say , ‘ This was the home of a wicked person , the place of one who rejected God . ' ”
