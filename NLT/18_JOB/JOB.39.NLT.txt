18:39:001:1	The
18:39:002:1	Lord
18:39:003:1	's Challenge Continues
18:39:001:0	“ Do you know when the wild goats give birth ? Have you watched as deer are born in the wild ?
18:39:002:0	Do you know how many months they carry their young ? Are you aware of the time of their delivery ?
18:39:003:0	They crouch down to give birth to their youngand deliver their offspring .
18:39:004:0	Their young grow up in the open fields , then leave home and never return .
18:39:005:0	“ Who gives the wild donkey its freedom ? Who untied its ropes ?
18:39:006:0	I have placed it in the wilderness ; its home is the wasteland .
18:39:007:0	It hates the noise of the cityand has no driver to shout at it .
18:39:008:0	The mountains are its pastureland , where it searches for every blade of grass .
18:39:009:0	“ Will the wild ox consent to being tamed ? Will it spend the night in your stall ?
18:39:010:0	Can you hitch a wild ox to a plow ? Will it plow a field for you ?
18:39:011:0	Given its strength , can you trust it ? Can you leave and trust the ox to do your work ?
18:39:012:0	Can you rely on it to bring home your grainand deliver it to your threshing floor ?
18:39:013:0	“ The ostrich flaps her wings grandly , but they are no match for the feathers of the stork .
18:39:014:0	She lays her eggs on top of the earth , letting them be warmed in the dust .
18:39:015:0	She does n't worry that a foot might crush themor a wild animal might destroy them .
18:39:016:0	She is harsh toward her young , as if they were not her own.She does n't care if they die .
18:39:017:0	For God has deprived her of wisdom.He has given her no understanding .
18:39:018:0	But whenever she jumps up to run , she passes the swiftest horse with its rider .
18:39:019:0	“ Have you given the horse its strengthor clothed its neck with a flowing mane ?
18:39:020:0	Did you give it the ability to leap like a locust ? Its majestic snorting is terrifying !
18:39:021:0	It paws the earth and rejoices in its strengthwhen it charges out to battle .
18:39:022:0	It laughs at fear and is unafraid.It does not run from the sword .
18:39:023:0	The arrows rattle against it , and the spear and javelin flash .
18:39:024:0	It paws the ground fiercelyand rushes forward into battle when the ram 's horn blows .
18:39:025:0	It snorts at the sound of the horn.It senses the battle in the distance.It quivers at the captain 's commands and the noise of battle .
18:39:026:0	“ Is it your wisdom that makes the hawk soarand spread its wings toward the south ?
18:39:027:0	Is it at your command that the eagle risesto the heights to make its nest ?
18:39:028:0	It lives on the cliffs , making its home on a distant , rocky crag .
18:39:029:0	From there it hunts its prey , keeping watch with piercing eyes .
18:39:030:0	Its young gulp down blood.Where there 's a carcass , there you 'll find it . ”
