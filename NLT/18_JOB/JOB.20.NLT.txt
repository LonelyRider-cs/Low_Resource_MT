18:20:001:1	Zophar 's Second Response to Job
18:20:001:0	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied :
18:20:002:0	“ I must replybecause I am greatly disturbed .
18:20:003:0	I 've had to endure your insults , but now my spirit prompts me to reply .
18:20:004:0	“ Do n't you realize that from the beginning of time , ever since people were first placed on the earth ,
18:20:005:0	the triumph of the wicked has been short livedand the joy of the godless has been only temporary ?
18:20:006:0	Though the pride of the godless reaches to the heavensand their heads touch the clouds ,
18:20:007:0	yet they will vanish forever , thrown away like their own dung.Those who knew them will ask , ‘ Where are they ? '
18:20:008:0	They will fade like a dream and not be found.They will vanish like a vision in the night .
18:20:009:0	Those who once saw them will see them no more.Their families will never see them again .
18:20:010:0	Their children will beg from the poor , for they must give back their stolen riches .
18:20:011:0	Though they are young , their bones will lie in the dust .
18:20:012:0	“ They enjoyed the sweet taste of wickedness , letting it melt under their tongue .
18:20:013:0	They savored it , holding it long in their mouths .
18:20:014:0	But suddenly the food in their bellies turns sour , a poisonous venom in their stomach .
18:20:015:0	They will vomit the wealth they swallowed.God wo n't let them keep it down .
18:20:016:0	They will suck the poison of cobras.The viper will kill them .
18:20:017:0	They will never again enjoy streams of olive oilor rivers of milk and honey .
18:20:018:0	They will give back everything they worked for.Their wealth will bring them no joy .
18:20:019:0	For they oppressed the poor and left them destitute.They foreclosed on their homes .
18:20:020:0	They were always greedy and never satisfied.Nothing remains of all the things they dreamed about .
18:20:021:0	Nothing is left after they finish gorging themselves.Therefore , their prosperity will not endure .
18:20:022:0	“ In the midst of plenty , they will run into troubleand be overcome by misery .
18:20:023:0	May God give them a bellyful of trouble.May God rain down his anger upon them .
18:20:024:0	When they try to escape an iron weapon , a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce them .
18:20:025:0	The arrow is pulled from their back , and the arrowhead glistens with blood.The terrors of death are upon them .
18:20:026:0	Their treasures will be thrown into deepest darkness.A wildfire will devour their goods , consuming all they have left .
18:20:027:0	The heavens will reveal their guilt , and the earth will testify against them .
18:20:028:0	A flood will sweep away their house.God 's anger will descend on them in torrents .
18:20:029:0	This is the reward that God gives the wicked.It is the inheritance decreed by God . ”
