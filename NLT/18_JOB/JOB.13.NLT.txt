18:13:001:1	Job Wants to Argue His Case with God
18:13:001:0	“ Look , I have seen all this with my own eyesand heard it with my own ears , and now I understand .
18:13:002:0	I know as much as you do.You are no better than I am .
18:13:003:0	As for me , I would speak directly to the Almighty.I want to argue my case with God himself .
18:13:004:0	As for you , you smear me with lies.As physicians , you are worthless quacks .
18:13:005:0	If only you could be silent ! That 's the wisest thing you could do .
18:13:006:0	Listen to my charge ; pay attention to my arguments .
18:13:007:0	“ Are you defending God with lies ? Do you make your dishonest arguments for his sake ?
18:13:008:0	Will you slant your testimony in his favor ? Will you argue God 's case for him ?
18:13:009:0	What will happen when he finds out what you are doing ? Can you fool him as easily as you fool people ?
18:13:010:0	No , you will be in trouble with himif you secretly slant your testimony in his favor .
18:13:011:0	Does n't his majesty terrify you ? Does n't your fear of him overwhelm you ?
18:13:012:0	Your platitudes are as valuable as ashes.Your defense is as fragile as a clay pot .
18:13:013:0	“ Be silent now and leave me alone.Let me speak , and I will face the consequences .
18:13:014:0	Why should I put myself in mortal dangerand take my life in my own hands ?
18:13:015:0	God might kill me , but I have no other hope.I am going to argue my case with him .
18:13:016:0	But this is what will save me—I am not godless.If I were , I could not stand before him .
18:13:017:0	“ Listen closely to what I am about to say.Hear me out .
18:13:018:0	I have prepared my case ; I will be proved innocent .
18:13:002:1	Job Asks How He Has Sinned
18:13:019:0	Who can argue with me over this ? And if you prove me wrong , I will remain silent and die .
18:13:020:0	“ O God , grant me these two things , and then I will be able to face you .
18:13:021:0	Remove your heavy hand from me , and do n't terrify me with your awesome presence .
18:13:022:0	Now summon me , and I will answer ! Or let me speak to you , and you reply .
18:13:023:0	Tell me , what have I done wrong ? Show me my rebellion and my sin .
18:13:024:0	Why do you turn away from me ? Why do you treat me as your enemy ?
18:13:025:0	Would you terrify a leaf blown by the wind ? Would you chase dry straw ?
18:13:026:0	“ You write bitter accusations against meand bring up all the sins of my youth .
18:13:027:0	You put my feet in stocks.You examine all my paths.You trace all my footprints .
18:13:028:0	I waste away like rotting wood , like a moth-eaten coat .
