18:42:001:1	Job Responds to the
18:42:002:1	Lord
18:42:001:0	Then Job replied to the Lord :
18:42:002:0	“ I know that you can do anything , and no one can stop you .
18:42:003:0	You asked , ‘ Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance ? 'It is I—and I was talking about things I knew nothing about , things far too wonderful for me .
18:42:004:0	You said , ‘ Listen and I will speak ! I have some questions for you , and you must answer them . '
18:42:005:0	I had only heard about you before , but now I have seen you with my own eyes .
18:42:003:1	Conclusion : The
18:42:004:1	Lord
18:42:005:1	Blesses Job
18:42:006:0	I take back everything I said , and I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance . ”
18:42:007:0	After the Lord had finished speaking to Job , he said to Eliphaz the Temanite : “ I am angry with you and your two friends , for you have not spoken accurately about me , as my servant Job has .
18:42:008:0	So take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves . My servant Job will pray for you , and I will accept his prayer on your behalf . I will not treat you as you deserve , for you have not spoken accurately about me , as my servant Job has . ”
18:42:009:0	So Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite did as the Lord commanded them , and the Lord accepted Job 's prayer .
18:42:010:0	When Job prayed for his friends , the Lord restored his fortunes . In fact , the Lord gave him twice as much as before !
18:42:011:0	Then all his brothers , sisters , and former friends came and feasted with him in his home . And they consoled him and comforted him because of all the trials the Lord had brought against him . And each of them brought him a gift of money and a gold ring .
18:42:012:0	So the Lord blessed Job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning . For now he had 14,000 sheep , 6,000 camels , 1,000 teams of oxen , and 1,000 female donkeys .
18:42:013:0	He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters .
18:42:014:0	He named his first daughter Jemimah , the second Keziah , and the third Keren-happuch .
18:42:015:0	In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job . And their father put them into his will along with their brothers .
18:42:016:0	Job lived 140 years after that , living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren .
18:42:017:0	Then he died , an old man who had lived a long , full life .
