18:4:001:1	Eliphaz 's First Response to Job
18:4:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied to Job :
18:4:002:0	“ Will you be patient and let me say a word ? For who could keep from speaking out ?
18:4:003:0	“ In the past you have encouraged many people ; you have strengthened those who were weak .
18:4:004:0	Your words have supported those who were falling ; you encouraged those with shaky knees .
18:4:005:0	But now when trouble strikes , you lose heart.You are terrified when it touches you .
18:4:006:0	Does n't your reverence for God give you confidence ? Does n't your life of integrity give you hope ?
18:4:007:0	“ Stop and think ! Do the innocent die ? When have the upright been destroyed ?
18:4:008:0	My experience shows that those who plant troubleand cultivate evil will harvest the same .
18:4:009:0	A breath from God destroys them.They vanish in a blast of his anger .
18:4:010:0	The lion roars and the wildcat snarls , but the teeth of strong lions will be broken .
18:4:011:0	The fierce lion will starve for lack of prey , and the cubs of the lioness will be scattered .
18:4:012:0	“ This truth was given to me in secret , as though whispered in my ear .
18:4:013:0	It came to me in a disturbing vision at night , when people are in a deep sleep .
18:4:014:0	Fear gripped me , and my bones trembled .
18:4:015:0	A spirit swept past my face , and my hair stood on end .
18:4:016:0	The spirit stopped , but I could n't see its shape.There was a form before my eyes.In the silence I heard a voice say ,
18:4:017:0	‘ Can a mortal be innocent before God ? Can anyone be pure before the Creator ? '
18:4:018:0	“ If God does not trust his own angelsand has charged his messengers with foolishness ,
18:4:019:0	how much less will he trust people made of clay ! They are made of dust , crushed as easily as a moth .
18:4:020:0	They are alive in the morning but dead by evening , gone forever without a trace .
18:4:021:0	Their tent-cords are pulled and the tent collapses , and they die in ignorance .
