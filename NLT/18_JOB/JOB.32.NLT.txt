18:32:001:1	Elihu Responds to Job 's Friends
18:32:001:0	Job 's three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting on his innocence .
18:32:002:0	Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite , of the clan of Ram , became angry . He was angry because Job refused to admit that he had sinned and that God was right in punishing him .
18:32:003:0	He was also angry with Job 's three friends , for they made God appear to be wrong by their inability to answer Job 's arguments .
18:32:004:0	Elihu had waited for the others to speak to Job because they were older than he .
18:32:005:0	But when he saw that they had no further reply , he spoke out angrily .
18:32:006:0	Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said , “ I am young and you are old , so I held back from telling you what I think .
18:32:007:0	I thought , ‘ Those who are older should speak , for wisdom comes with age . '
18:32:008:0	But there is a spirit within people , the breath of the Almighty within them , that makes them intelligent .
18:32:009:0	Sometimes the elders are not wise.Sometimes the aged do not understand justice .
18:32:010:0	So listen to me , and let me tell you what I think .
18:32:011:0	“ I have waited all this time , listening very carefully to your arguments , listening to you grope for words .
18:32:012:0	I have listened , but not one of you has refuted Jobor answered his arguments .
18:32:013:0	And do n't tell me , ‘ He is too wise for us.Only God can convince him . '
18:32:014:0	If Job had been arguing with me , I would not answer with your kind of logic !
18:32:015:0	You sit there baffled , with nothing more to say .
18:32:016:0	Should I continue to wait , now that you are silent ? Must I also remain silent ?
18:32:017:0	No , I will say my piece.I will speak my mind .
18:32:018:0	For I am full of pent-up words , and the spirit within me urges me on .
18:32:019:0	I am like a cask of wine without a vent , like a new wineskin ready to burst !
18:32:020:0	I must speak to find relief , so let me give my answers .
18:32:021:0	I wo n't play favoritesor try to flatter anyone .
18:32:022:0	For if I tried flattery , my Creator would soon destroy me .
