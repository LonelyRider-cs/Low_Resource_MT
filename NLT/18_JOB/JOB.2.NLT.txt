18:2:001:1	Job 's Second Test
18:2:001:0	One day the members of the heavenly court came again to present themselves before the Lord , and the Accuser , Satan , came with them .
18:2:002:0	“ Where have you come from ? ” the Lord asked Satan.Satan answered the Lord , “ I have been patrolling the earth , watching everything that 's going on . ”
18:2:003:0	Then the Lord asked Satan , “ Have you noticed my servant Job ? He is the finest man in all the earth . He is blameless—a man of complete integrity . He fears God and stays away from evil . And he has maintained his integrity , even though you urged me to harm him without cause . ”
18:2:004:0	Satan replied to the Lord , “ Skin for skin ! A man will give up everything he has to save his life .
18:2:005:0	But reach out and take away his health , and he will surely curse you to your face ! ”
18:2:006:0	“ All right , do with him as you please , ” the Lord said to Satan . “ But spare his life . ”
18:2:007:0	So Satan left the Lord 's presence , and he struck Job with terrible boils from head to foot .
18:2:008:0	Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes .
18:2:009:0	His wife said to him , “ Are you still trying to maintain your integrity ? Curse God and die . ”

18:2:010:0	But Job replied , “ You talk like a foolish woman . Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad ? ” So in all this , Job said nothing wrong .
18:2:011:0	When three of Job 's friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered , they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him . Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite .
18:2:012:0	When they saw Job from a distance , they scarcely recognized him . Wailing loudly , they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief .
18:2:013:0	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights . No one said a word to Job , for they saw that his suffering was too great for words .
