18:31:001:1	Job 's Final Protest of Innocence
18:31:001:0	“ I made a covenant with my eyesnot to look with lust at a young woman .
18:31:002:0	For what has God above chosen for us ? What is our inheritance from the Almighty on high ?
18:31:003:0	Is n't it calamity for the wickedand misfortune for those who do evil ?
18:31:004:0	Does n't he see everything I doand every step I take ?
18:31:005:0	“ Have I lied to anyoneor deceived anyone ?
18:31:006:0	Let God weigh me on the scales of justice , for he knows my integrity .
18:31:007:0	If I have strayed from his pathway , or if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen , or if I am guilty of any other sin ,
18:31:008:0	then let someone else eat the crops I have planted.Let all that I have planted be uprooted .
18:31:009:0	“ If my heart has been seduced by a woman , or if I have lusted for my neighbor 's wife ,
18:31:010:0	then let my wife serve another man ; let other men sleep with her .
18:31:011:0	For lust is a shameful sin , a crime that should be punished .
18:31:012:0	It is a fire that burns all the way to hell.It would wipe out everything I own .
18:31:013:0	“ If I have been unfair to my male or female servantswhen they brought their complaints to me ,
18:31:014:0	how could I face God ? What could I say when he questioned me ?
18:31:015:0	For God created both me and my servants.He created us both in the womb .
18:31:016:0	“ Have I refused to help the poor , or crushed the hopes of widows ?
18:31:017:0	Have I been stingy with my foodand refused to share it with orphans ?
18:31:018:0	No , from childhood I have cared for orphans like a father , and all my life I have cared for widows .
18:31:019:0	Whenever I saw the homeless without clothesand the needy with nothing to wear ,
18:31:020:0	did they not praise mefor providing wool clothing to keep them warm ?
18:31:021:0	“ If I raised my hand against an orphan , knowing the judges would take my side ,
18:31:022:0	then let my shoulder be wrenched out of place ! Let my arm be torn from its socket !
18:31:023:0	That would be better than facing God 's judgment.For if the majesty of God opposes me , what hope is there ?
18:31:024:0	“ Have I put my trust in moneyor felt secure because of my gold ?
18:31:025:0	Have I gloated about my wealthand all that I own ?
18:31:026:0	“ Have I looked at the sun shining in the skies , or the moon walking down its silver pathway ,
18:31:027:0	and been secretly enticed in my heartto throw kisses at them in worship ?
18:31:028:0	If so , I should be punished by the judges , for it would mean I had denied the God of heaven .
18:31:029:0	“ Have I ever rejoiced when disaster struck my enemies , or become excited when harm came their way ?
18:31:030:0	No , I have never sinned by cursing anyoneor by asking for revenge .
18:31:031:0	“ My servants have never said , ‘ He let others go hungry . '
18:31:032:0	I have never turned away a strangerbut have opened my doors to everyone .
18:31:033:0	“ Have I tried to hide my sins like other people do , concealing my guilt in my heart ?
18:31:034:0	Have I feared the crowdor the contempt of the masses , so that I kept quiet and stayed indoors ?
18:31:035:0	“ If only someone would listen to me ! Look , I will sign my name to my defense.Let the Almighty answer me.Let my accuser write out the charges against me .
18:31:036:0	I would face the accusation proudly.I would wear it like a crown .
18:31:037:0	For I would tell him exactly what I have done.I would come before him like a prince .
18:31:038:0	“ If my land accuses meand all its furrows cry out together ,
18:31:039:0	or if I have stolen its cropsor murdered its owners ,
18:31:040:0	then let thistles grow on that land instead of wheat , and weeds instead of barley. ” Job 's words are ended .
