18:12:001:1	Job 's Fourth Speech : A Response to Zophar
18:12:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:12:002:0	“ You people really know everything , do n't you ? And when you die , wisdom will die with you !
18:12:003:0	Well , I know a few things myself — and you 're no better than I am.Who does n't know these things you 've been saying ?
18:12:004:0	Yet my friends laugh at me , for I call on God and expect an answer.I am a just and blameless man , yet they laugh at me .
18:12:005:0	People who are at ease mock those in trouble.They give a push to people who are stumbling .
18:12:006:0	But robbers are left in peace , and those who provoke God live in safety — though God keeps them in his power .
18:12:007:0	“ Just ask the animals , and they will teach you.Ask the birds of the sky , and they will tell you .
18:12:008:0	Speak to the earth , and it will instruct you.Let the fish in the sea speak to you .
18:12:009:0	For they all knowthat my disaster has come from the hand of the Lord .
18:12:010:0	For the life of every living thing is in his hand , and the breath of every human being .
18:12:011:0	The ear tests the words it hearsjust as the mouth distinguishes between foods .
18:12:012:0	Wisdom belongs to the aged , and understanding to the old .
18:12:013:0	“ But true wisdom and power are found in God ; counsel and understanding are his .
18:12:014:0	What he destroys can not be rebuilt.When he puts someone in prison , there is no escape .
18:12:015:0	If he holds back the rain , the earth becomes a desert.If he releases the waters , they flood the earth .
18:12:016:0	Yes , strength and wisdom are his ; deceivers and deceived are both in his power .
18:12:017:0	He leads counselors away , stripped of good judgment ; wise judges become fools .
18:12:018:0	He removes the royal robe of kings.They are led away with ropes around their waist .
18:12:019:0	He leads priests away , stripped of status ; he overthrows those with long years in power .
18:12:020:0	He silences the trusted adviserand removes the insight of the elders .
18:12:021:0	He pours disgrace upon princesand disarms the strong .
18:12:022:0	“ He uncovers mysteries hidden in darkness ; he brings light to the deepest gloom .
18:12:023:0	He builds up nations , and he destroys them.He expands nations , and he abandons them .
18:12:024:0	He strips kings of understandingand leaves them wandering in a pathless wasteland .
18:12:025:0	They grope in the darkness without a light.He makes them stagger like drunkards .
