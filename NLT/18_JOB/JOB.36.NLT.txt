18:36:001:0	Elihu continued speaking :
18:36:002:0	“ Let me go on , and I will show you the truth.For I have not finished defending God !
18:36:003:0	I will present profound argumentsfor the righteousness of my Creator .
18:36:004:0	I am telling you nothing but the truth , for I am a man of great knowledge .
18:36:005:0	“ God is mighty , but he does not despise anyone ! He is mighty in both power and understanding .
18:36:006:0	He does not let the wicked livebut gives justice to the afflicted .
18:36:007:0	He never takes his eyes off the innocent , but he sets them on thrones with kingsand exalts them forever .
18:36:008:0	If they are bound in chainsand caught up in a web of trouble ,
18:36:009:0	he shows them the reason.He shows them their sins of pride .
18:36:010:0	He gets their attentionand commands that they turn from evil .
18:36:011:0	“ If they listen and obey God , they will be blessed with prosperity throughout their lives.All their years will be pleasant .
18:36:012:0	But if they refuse to listen to him , they will cross over the river of death , dying from lack of understanding .
18:36:013:0	For the godless are full of resentment.Even when he punishes them , they refuse to cry out to him for help .
18:36:014:0	They die when they are young , after wasting their lives in immoral living .
18:36:015:0	But by means of their suffering , he rescues those who suffer.For he gets their attention through adversity .
18:36:016:0	“ God is leading you away from danger , Job , to a place free from distress.He is setting your table with the best food .
18:36:017:0	But you are obsessed with whether the godless will be judged.Do n't worry , judgment and justice will be upheld .
18:36:018:0	But watch out , or you may be seduced by wealth.Do n't let yourself be bribed into sin .
18:36:019:0	Could all your wealthor all your mighty effortskeep you from distress ?
18:36:020:0	Do not long for the cover of night , for that is when people will be destroyed .
18:36:001:1	Elihu Reminds Job of God 's Power
18:36:021:0	Be on guard ! Turn back from evil , for God sent this sufferingto keep you from a life of evil .
18:36:022:0	“ Look , God is all-powerful.Who is a teacher like him ?
18:36:023:0	No one can tell him what to do , or say to him , ‘ You have done wrong . '
18:36:024:0	Instead , glorify his mighty works , singing songs of praise .
18:36:025:0	Everyone has seen these things , though only from a distance .
18:36:026:0	“ Look , God is greater than we can understand.His years can not be counted .
18:36:027:0	He draws up the water vaporand then distills it into rain .
18:36:028:0	The rain pours down from the clouds , and everyone benefits .
18:36:029:0	Who can understand the spreading of the cloudsand the thunder that rolls forth from heaven ?
18:36:030:0	See how he spreads the lightning around himand how it lights up the depths of the sea .
18:36:031:0	By these mighty acts he nourishes the people , giving them food in abundance .
18:36:032:0	He fills his hands with lightning boltsand hurls each at its target .
18:36:033:0	The thunder announces his presence ; the storm announces his indignant anger .
