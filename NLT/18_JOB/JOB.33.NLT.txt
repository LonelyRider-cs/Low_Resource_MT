18:33:001:1	Elihu Presents His Case against Job
18:33:001:0	“ Listen to my words , Job ; pay attention to what I have to say .
18:33:002:0	Now that I have begun to speak , let me continue .
18:33:003:0	I speak with all sincerity ; I speak the truth .
18:33:004:0	For the Spirit of God has made me , and the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
18:33:005:0	Answer me , if you can ; make your case and take your stand .
18:33:006:0	Look , you and I both belong to God.I , too , was formed from clay .
18:33:007:0	So you do n't need to be afraid of me.I wo n't come down hard on you .
18:33:008:0	“ You have spoken in my hearing , and I have heard your very words .
18:33:009:0	You said , ‘ I am pure ; I am without sin ; I am innocent ; I have no guilt .
18:33:010:0	God is picking a quarrel with me , and he considers me his enemy .
18:33:011:0	He puts my feet in the stocksand watches my every move . '
18:33:012:0	“ But you are wrong , and I will show you why.For God is greater than any human being .
18:33:013:0	So why are you bringing a charge against him ? Why say he does not respond to people 's complaints ?
18:33:014:0	For God speaks again and again , though people do not recognize it .
18:33:015:0	He speaks in dreams , in visions of the night , when deep sleep falls on peopleas they lie in their beds .
18:33:016:0	He whispers in their earsand terrifies them with warnings .
18:33:017:0	He makes them turn from doing wrong ; he keeps them from pride .
18:33:018:0	He protects them from the grave , from crossing over the river of death .
18:33:019:0	“ Or God disciplines people with pain on their sickbeds , with ceaseless aching in their bones .
18:33:020:0	They lose their appetitefor even the most delicious food .
18:33:021:0	Their flesh wastes away , and their bones stick out .
18:33:022:0	They are at death 's door ; the angels of death wait for them .
18:33:023:0	“ But if an angel from heaven appears — a special messenger to intercede for a personand declare that he is upright —
18:33:024:0	he will be gracious and say , ‘ Rescue him from the grave , for I have found a ransom for his life . '
18:33:025:0	Then his body will become as healthy as a child 's , firm and youthful again .
18:33:026:0	When he prays to God , he will be accepted.And God will receive him with joyand restore him to good standing .
18:33:027:0	He will declare to his friends , ‘ I sinned and twisted the truth , but it was not worth it .
18:33:028:0	God rescued me from the grave , and now my life is filled with light . '
18:33:029:0	“ Yes , God does these thingsagain and again for people .
18:33:030:0	He rescues them from the graveso they may enjoy the light of life .
18:33:031:0	Mark this well , Job . Listen to me , for I have more to say .
18:33:032:0	But if you have anything to say , go ahead.Speak , for I am anxious to see you justified .
18:33:033:0	But if not , then listen to me.Keep silent and I will teach you wisdom ! ”
