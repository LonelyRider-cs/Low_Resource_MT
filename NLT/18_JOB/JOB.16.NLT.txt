18:16:001:1	Job 's Fifth Speech : A Response to Eliphaz
18:16:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:16:002:0	“ I have heard all this before.What miserable comforters you are !
18:16:003:0	Wo n't you ever stop blowing hot air ? What makes you keep on talking ?
18:16:004:0	I could say the same things if you were in my place.I could spout off criticism and shake my head at you .
18:16:005:0	But if it were me , I would encourage you.I would try to take away your grief .
18:16:006:0	Instead , I suffer if I defend myself , and I suffer no less if I refuse to speak .
18:16:007:0	“ O God , you have ground me downand devastated my family .
18:16:008:0	As if to prove I have sinned , you 've reduced me to skin and bones.My gaunt flesh testifies against me .
18:16:009:0	God hates me and angrily tears me apart.He snaps his teeth at meand pierces me with his eyes .
18:16:010:0	People jeer and laugh at me.They slap my cheek in contempt.A mob gathers against me .
18:16:011:0	God has handed me over to sinners.He has tossed me into the hands of the wicked .
18:16:012:0	“ I was living quietly until he shattered me.He took me by the neck and broke me in pieces.Then he set me up as his target ,
18:16:013:0	and now his archers surround me.His arrows pierce me without mercy.The ground is wet with my blood .
18:16:014:0	Again and again he smashes against me , charging at me like a warrior .
18:16:015:0	I wear burlap to show my grief.My pride lies in the dust .
18:16:016:0	My eyes are red with weeping ; dark shadows circle my eyes .
18:16:017:0	Yet I have done no wrong , and my prayer is pure .
18:16:018:0	“ O earth , do not conceal my blood.Let it cry out on my behalf .
18:16:019:0	Even now my witness is in heaven.My advocate is there on high .
18:16:020:0	My friends scorn me , but I pour out my tears to God .
18:16:021:0	I need someone to mediate between God and me , as a person mediates between friends .
18:16:022:0	For soon I must go down that roadfrom which I will never return .
