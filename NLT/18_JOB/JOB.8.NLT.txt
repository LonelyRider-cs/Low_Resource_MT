18:8:001:1	Bildad 's First Response to Job
18:8:001:0	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job :
18:8:002:0	“ How long will you go on like this ? You sound like a blustering wind .
18:8:003:0	Does God twist justice ? Does the Almighty twist what is right ?
18:8:004:0	Your children must have sinned against him , so their punishment was well deserved .
18:8:005:0	But if you pray to Godand seek the favor of the Almighty ,
18:8:006:0	and if you are pure and live with integrity , he will surely rise up and restore your happy home .
18:8:007:0	And though you started with little , you will end with much .
18:8:008:0	“ Just ask the previous generation.Pay attention to the experience of our ancestors .
18:8:009:0	For we were born but yesterday and know nothing.Our days on earth are as fleeting as a shadow .
18:8:010:0	But those who came before us will teach you.They will teach you the wisdom of old .
18:8:011:0	“ Can papyrus reeds grow tall without a marsh ? Can marsh grass flourish without water ?
18:8:012:0	While they are still flowering , not ready to be cut , they begin to wither more quickly than grass .
18:8:013:0	The same happens to all who forget God.The hopes of the godless evaporate .
18:8:014:0	Their confidence hangs by a thread.They are leaning on a spider 's web .
18:8:015:0	They cling to their home for security , but it wo n't last.They try to hold it tight , but it will not endure .
18:8:016:0	The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine , its branches spreading across the garden .
18:8:017:0	Its roots grow down through a pile of stones ; it takes hold on a bed of rocks .
18:8:018:0	But when it is uprooted , it 's as though it never existed !
18:8:019:0	That 's the end of its life , and others spring up from the earth to replace it .
18:8:020:0	“ But look , God will not reject a person of integrity , nor will he lend a hand to the wicked .
18:8:021:0	He will once again fill your mouth with laughterand your lips with shouts of joy .
18:8:022:0	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame , and the home of the wicked will be destroyed . ”
