18:21:001:1	Job 's Seventh Speech : A Response to Zophar
18:21:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:21:002:0	“ Listen closely to what I am saying.That 's one consolation you can give me .
18:21:003:0	Bear with me , and let me speak.After I have spoken , you may resume mocking me .
18:21:004:0	“ My complaint is with God , not with people.I have good reason to be so impatient .
18:21:005:0	Look at me and be stunned.Put your hand over your mouth in shock .
18:21:006:0	When I think about what I am saying , I shudder.My body trembles .
18:21:007:0	“ Why do the wicked prosper , growing old and powerful ?
18:21:008:0	They live to see their children grow up and settle down , and they enjoy their grandchildren .
18:21:009:0	Their homes are safe from every fear , and God does not punish them .
18:21:010:0	Their bulls never fail to breed.Their cows bear calves and never miscarry .
18:21:011:0	They let their children frisk about like lambs.Their little ones skip and dance .
18:21:012:0	They sing with tambourine and harp.They celebrate to the sound of the flute .
18:21:013:0	They spend their days in prosperity , then go down to the grave in peace .
18:21:014:0	And yet they say to God , ‘ Go away.We want no part of you and your ways .
18:21:015:0	Who is the Almighty , and why should we obey him ? What good will it do us to pray ? '
18:21:016:0	( They think their prosperity is of their own doing , but I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking . )
18:21:017:0	“ Yet the light of the wicked never seems to be extinguished.Do they ever have trouble ? Does God distribute sorrows to them in anger ?
18:21:018:0	Are they driven before the wind like straw ? Are they carried away by the storm like chaff ? Not at all !
18:21:019:0	“ ‘ Well , ' you say , ‘ at least God will punish their children ! 'But I say he should punish the ones who sin , so that they understand his judgment .
18:21:020:0	Let them see their destruction with their own eyes.Let them drink deeply of the anger of the Almighty .
18:21:021:0	For they will not care what happens to their familyafter they are dead .
18:21:022:0	“ But who can teach a lesson to God , since he judges even the most powerful ?
18:21:023:0	One person dies in prosperity , completely comfortable and secure ,
18:21:024:0	the picture of good health , vigorous and fit .
18:21:025:0	Another person dies in bitter poverty , never having tasted the good life .
18:21:026:0	But both are buried in the same dust , both eaten by the same maggots .
18:21:027:0	“ Look , I know what you 're thinking.I know the schemes you plot against me .
18:21:028:0	You will tell me of rich and wicked peoplewhose houses have vanished because of their sins .
18:21:029:0	But ask those who have been around , and they will tell you the truth .
18:21:030:0	Evil people are spared in times of calamityand are allowed to escape disaster .
18:21:031:0	No one criticizes them openlyor pays them back for what they have done .
18:21:032:0	When they are carried to the grave , an honor guard keeps watch at their tomb .
18:21:033:0	A great funeral procession goes to the cemetery.Many pay their respects as the body is laid to rest , and the earth gives sweet repose .
18:21:034:0	“ How can your empty clichés comfort me ? All your explanations are lies ! ”
