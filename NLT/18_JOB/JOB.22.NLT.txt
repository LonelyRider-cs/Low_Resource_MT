18:22:001:1	Eliphaz 's Third Response to Job
18:22:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied :
18:22:002:0	“ Can a person do anything to help God ? Can even a wise person be helpful to him ?
18:22:003:0	Is it any advantage to the Almighty if you are righteous ? Would it be any gain to him if you were perfect ?
18:22:004:0	Is it because you 're so pious that he accuses youand brings judgment against you ?
18:22:005:0	No , it 's because of your wickedness ! There 's no limit to your sins .
18:22:006:0	“ For example , you must have lent money to your friendand demanded clothing as security.Yes , you stripped him to the bone .
18:22:007:0	You must have refused water for the thirstyand food for the hungry .
18:22:008:0	You probably think the land belongs to the powerfuland only the privileged have a right to it !
18:22:009:0	You must have sent widows away empty-handedand crushed the hopes of orphans .
18:22:010:0	That is why you are surrounded by trapsand tremble from sudden fears .
18:22:011:0	That is why you can not see in the darkness , and waves of water cover you .
18:22:012:0	“ God is so great — higher than the heavens , higher than the farthest stars .
18:22:013:0	But you reply , ‘ That 's why God ca n't see what I am doing ! How can he judge through the thick darkness ?
18:22:014:0	For thick clouds swirl about him , and he can not see us.He is way up there , walking on the vault of heaven . '
18:22:015:0	“ Will you continue on the old pathswhere evil people have walked ?
18:22:016:0	They were snatched away in the prime of life , the foundations of their lives washed away .
18:22:017:0	For they said to God , ‘ Leave us alone ! What can the Almighty do to us ? '
18:22:018:0	Yet he was the one who filled their homes with good things , so I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking .
18:22:019:0	“ The righteous will be happy to see the wicked destroyed , and the innocent will laugh in contempt .
18:22:020:0	They will say , ‘ See how our enemies have been destroyed.The last of them have been consumed in the fire . '
18:22:021:0	“ Submit to God , and you will have peace ; then things will go well for you .
18:22:022:0	Listen to his instructions , and store them in your heart .
18:22:023:0	If you return to the Almighty , you will be restored — so clean up your life .
18:22:024:0	If you give up your lust for moneyand throw your precious gold into the river ,
18:22:025:0	the Almighty himself will be your treasure.He will be your precious silver !
18:22:026:0	“ Then you will take delight in the Almightyand look up to God .
18:22:027:0	You will pray to him , and he will hear you , and you will fulfill your vows to him .
18:22:028:0	You will succeed in whatever you choose to do , and light will shine on the road ahead of you .
18:22:029:0	If people are in trouble and you say , ‘ Help them , 'God will save them .
18:22:030:0	Even sinners will be rescued ; they will be rescued because your hands are pure . ”
