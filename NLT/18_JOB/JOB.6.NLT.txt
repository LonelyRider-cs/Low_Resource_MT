18:6:001:1	Job 's Second Speech : A Response to Eliphaz
18:6:001:0	Then Job spoke again :
18:6:002:0	“ If my misery could be weighedand my troubles be put on the scales ,
18:6:003:0	they would outweigh all the sands of the sea.That is why I spoke impulsively .
18:6:004:0	For the Almighty has struck me down with his arrows.Their poison infects my spirit.God 's terrors are lined up against me .
18:6:005:0	Do n't I have a right to complain ? Do n't wild donkeys bray when they find no grass , and oxen bellow when they have no food ?
18:6:006:0	Do n't people complain about unsalted food ? Does anyone want the tasteless white of an egg ?
18:6:007:0	My appetite disappears when I look at it ; I gag at the thought of eating it !
18:6:008:0	“ Oh , that I might have my request , that God would grant my desire .
18:6:009:0	I wish he would crush me.I wish he would reach out his hand and kill me .
18:6:010:0	At least I can take comfort in this : Despite the pain , I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
18:6:011:0	But I do n't have the strength to endure.I have nothing to live for .
18:6:012:0	Do I have the strength of a stone ? Is my body made of bronze ?
18:6:013:0	No , I am utterly helpless , without any chance of success .
18:6:014:0	“ One should be kind to a fainting friend , but you accuse me without any fear of the Almighty .
18:6:015:0	My brothers , you have proved as unreliable as a seasonal brookthat overflows its banks in the spring
18:6:016:0	when it is swollen with ice and melting snow .
18:6:017:0	But when the hot weather arrives , the water disappears.The brook vanishes in the heat .
18:6:018:0	The caravans turn aside to be refreshed , but there is nothing to drink , so they die .
18:6:019:0	The caravans from Tema search for this water ; the travelers from Sheba hope to find it .
18:6:020:0	They count on it but are disappointed.When they arrive , their hopes are dashed .
18:6:021:0	You , too , have given no help.You have seen my calamity , and you are afraid .
18:6:022:0	But why ? Have I ever asked you for a gift ? Have I begged for anything of yours for myself ?
18:6:023:0	Have I asked you to rescue me from my enemies , or to save me from ruthless people ?
18:6:024:0	Teach me , and I will keep quiet.Show me what I have done wrong .
18:6:025:0	Honest words can be painful , but what do your criticisms amount to ?
18:6:026:0	Do you think your words are convincingwhen you disregard my cry of desperation ?
18:6:027:0	You would even send an orphan into slaveryor sell a friend .
18:6:028:0	Look at me ! Would I lie to your face ?
18:6:029:0	Stop assuming my guilt , for I have done no wrong .
18:6:030:0	Do you think I am lying ? Do n't I know the difference between right and wrong ?
