18:7:001:0	“ Is not all human life a struggle ? Our lives are like that of a hired hand ,
18:7:002:0	like a worker who longs for the shade , like a servant waiting to be paid .
18:7:003:0	I , too , have been assigned months of futility , long and weary nights of misery .
18:7:004:0	Lying in bed , I think , ‘ When will it be morning ? 'But the night drags on , and I toss till dawn .
18:7:001:1	Job Cries Out to God
18:7:005:0	My body is covered with maggots and scabs.My skin breaks open , oozing with pus .
18:7:006:0	“ My days fly faster than a weaver 's shuttle.They end without hope .
18:7:007:0	O God , remember that my life is but a breath , and I will never again feel happiness .
18:7:008:0	You see me now , but not for long.You will look for me , but I will be gone .
18:7:009:0	Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes , those who die will not come back .
18:7:010:0	They are gone forever from their home — never to be seen again .
18:7:011:0	“ I can not keep from speaking.I must express my anguish.My bitter soul must complain .
18:7:012:0	Am I a sea monster or a dragonthat you must place me under guard ?
18:7:013:0	I think , ‘ My bed will comfort me , and sleep will ease my misery , '
18:7:014:0	but then you shatter me with dreamsand terrify me with visions .
18:7:015:0	I would rather be strangled — rather die than suffer like this .
18:7:016:0	I hate my life and do n't want to go on living.Oh , leave me alone for my few remaining days .
18:7:017:0	“ What are people , that you should make so much of us , that you should think of us so often ?
18:7:018:0	For you examine us every morningand test us every moment .
18:7:019:0	Why wo n't you leave me alone , at least long enough for me to swallow !
18:7:020:0	If I have sinned , what have I done to you , O watcher of all humanity ? Why make me your target ? Am I a burden to you ?
18:7:021:0	Why not just forgive my sinand take away my guilt ? For soon I will lie down in the dust and die.When you look for me , I will be gone . ”
