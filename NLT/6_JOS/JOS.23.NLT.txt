6:23:001:1	Joshua 's Final Words to Israel
6:23:001:0	The years passed , and the Lord had given the people of Israel rest from all their enemies . Joshua , who was now very old ,
6:23:002:0	called together all the elders , leaders , judges , and officers of Israel . He said to them , “ I am now a very old man .
6:23:003:0	You have seen everything the Lord your God has done for you during my lifetime . The Lord your God has fought for you against your enemies .
6:23:004:0	I have allotted to you as your homeland all the land of the nations yet unconquered , as well as the land of those we have already conquered—from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in the west .
6:23:005:0	This land will be yours , for the Lord your God will himself drive out all the people living there now . You will take possession of their land , just as the Lord your God promised you .
6:23:006:0	“ So be very careful to follow everything Moses wrote in the Book of Instruction . Do not deviate from it , turning either to the right or to the left .
6:23:007:0	Make sure you do not associate with the other people still remaining in the land . Do not even mention the names of their gods , much less swear by them or serve them or worship them .
6:23:008:0	Rather , cling tightly to the Lord your God as you have done until now .
6:23:009:0	“ For the Lord has driven out great and powerful nations for you , and no one has yet been able to defeat you .
6:23:010:0	Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy , for the Lord your God fights for you , just as he has promised .
6:23:011:0	So be very careful to love the Lord your God .
6:23:012:0	“ But if you turn away from him and cling to the customs of the survivors of these nations remaining among you , and if you intermarry with them ,
6:23:013:0	then know for certain that the Lord your God will no longer drive them out of your land . Instead , they will be a snare and a trap to you , a whip for your backs and thorny brambles in your eyes , and you will vanish from this good land the Lord your God has given you .
6:23:014:0	“ Soon I will die , going the way of everything on earth . Deep in your hearts you know that every promise of the Lord your God has come true . Not a single one has failed !
6:23:015:0	But as surely as the Lord your God has given you the good things he promised , he will also bring disaster on you if you disobey him . He will completely destroy you from this good land he has given you .
6:23:016:0	If you break the covenant of the Lord your God by worshiping and serving other gods , his anger will burn against you , and you will quickly vanish from the good land he has given you . ”
