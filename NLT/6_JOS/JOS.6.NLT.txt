6:6:001:1	The Fall of Jericho
6:6:001:0	Now the gates of Jericho were tightly shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites . No one was allowed to go out or in .
6:6:002:0	But the Lord said to Joshua , “ I have given you Jericho , its king , and all its strong warriors .
6:6:003:0	You and your fighting men should march around the town once a day for six days .
6:6:004:0	Seven priests will walk ahead of the Ark , each carrying a ram 's horn . On the seventh day you are to march around the town seven times , with the priests blowing the horns .
6:6:005:0	When you hear the priests give one long blast on the rams ' horns , have all the people shout as loud as they can . Then the walls of the town will collapse , and the people can charge straight into the town . ”
6:6:006:0	So Joshua called together the priests and said , “ Take up the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant , and assign seven priests to walk in front of it , each carrying a ram 's horn . ”
6:6:007:0	Then he gave orders to the people : “ March around the town , and the armed men will lead the way in front of the Ark of the Lord . ”
6:6:008:0	After Joshua spoke to the people , the seven priests with the rams ' horns started marching in the presence of the Lord , blowing the horns as they marched . And the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant followed behind them .
6:6:009:0	Some of the armed men marched in front of the priests with the horns and some behind the Ark , with the priests continually blowing the horns .
6:6:010:0	“ Do not shout ; do not even talk , ” Joshua commanded . “ Not a single word from any of you until I tell you to shout . Then shout ! ”
6:6:011:0	So the Ark of the Lord was carried around the town once that day , and then everyone returned to spend the night in the camp .
6:6:012:0	Joshua got up early the next morning , and the priests again carried the Ark of the Lord .
6:6:013:0	The seven priests with the rams ' horns marched in front of the Ark of the Lord , blowing their horns . Again the armed men marched both in front of the priests with the horns and behind the Ark of the Lord . All this time the priests were blowing their horns .
6:6:014:0	On the second day they again marched around the town once and returned to the camp . They followed this pattern for six days .
6:6:015:0	On the seventh day the Israelites got up at dawn and marched around the town as they had done before . But this time they went around the town seven times .
6:6:016:0	The seventh time around , as the priests sounded the long blast on their horns , Joshua commanded the people , “ Shout ! For the Lord has given you the town !
6:6:017:0	Jericho and everything in it must be completely destroyed as an offering to the Lord . Only Rahab the prostitute and the others in her house will be spared , for she protected our spies .
6:6:018:0	“ Do not take any of the things set apart for destruction , or you yourselves will be completely destroyed , and you will bring trouble on the camp of Israel .
6:6:019:0	Everything made from silver , gold , bronze , or iron is sacred to the Lord and must be brought into his treasury . ”
6:6:020:0	When the people heard the sound of the rams ' horns , they shouted as loud as they could . Suddenly , the walls of Jericho collapsed , and the Israelites charged straight into the town and captured it .
6:6:021:0	They completely destroyed everything in it with their swords — men and women , young and old , cattle , sheep , goats , and donkeys .
6:6:022:0	Meanwhile , Joshua said to the two spies , “ Keep your promise . Go to the prostitute 's house and bring her out , along with all her family . ”
6:6:023:0	The men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab , her father , mother , brothers , and all the other relatives who were with her . They moved her whole family to a safe place near the camp of Israel .
6:6:024:0	Then the Israelites burned the town and everything in it . Only the things made from silver , gold , bronze , or iron were kept for the treasury of the Lord 's house .
6:6:025:0	So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her relatives who were with her in the house , because she had hidden the spies Joshua sent to Jericho . And she lives among the Israelites to this day .
6:6:026:0	At that time Joshua invoked this curse : “ May the curse of the Lord fall on anyonewho tries to rebuild the town of Jericho.At the cost of his firstborn son , he will lay its foundation.At the cost of his youngest son , he will set up its gates . ”
6:6:027:0	So the Lord was with Joshua , and his reputation spread throughout the land .
