6:20:001:1	The Cities of Refuge
6:20:001:0	The Lord said to Joshua ,
6:20:002:0	“ Now tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge , as I instructed Moses .
6:20:003:0	Anyone who kills another person accidentally and unintentionally can run to one of these cities ; they will be places of refuge from relatives seeking revenge for the person who was killed .
6:20:004:0	“ Upon reaching one of these cities , the one who caused the death will appear before the elders at the city gate and present his case . They must allow him to enter the city and give him a place to live among them .
6:20:005:0	If the relatives of the victim come to avenge the killing , the leaders must not release the slayer to them , for he killed the other person unintentionally and without previous hostility .
6:20:006:0	But the slayer must stay in that city and be tried by the local assembly , which will render a judgment . And he must continue to live in that city until the death of the high priest who was in office at the time of the accident . After that , he is free to return to his own home in the town from which he fled . ”
6:20:007:0	The following cities were designated as cities of refuge : Kedesh of Galilee , in the hill country of Naphtali ; Shechem , in the hill country of Ephraim ; and Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) , in the hill country of Judah .
6:20:008:0	On the east side of the Jordan River , across from Jericho , the following cities were designated : Bezer , in the wilderness plain of the tribe of Reuben ; Ramoth in Gilead , in the territory of the tribe of Gad ; and Golan in Bashan , in the land of the tribe of Manasseh .
6:20:009:0	These cities were set apart for all the Israelites as well as the foreigners living among them . Anyone who accidentally killed another person could take refuge in one of these cities . In this way , they could escape being killed in revenge prior to standing trial before the local assembly .
