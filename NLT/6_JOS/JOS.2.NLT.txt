6:2:001:1	Rahab Protects the Spies
6:2:001:0	Then Joshua secretly sent out two spies from the Israelite camp at Acacia Grove . He instructed them , “ Scout out the land on the other side of the Jordan River , especially around Jericho. ” So the two men set out and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there that night .
6:2:002:0	But someone told the king of Jericho , “ Some Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land . ”
6:2:003:0	So the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab : “ Bring out the men who have come into your house , for they have come here to spy out the whole land . ”
6:2:004:0	Rahab had hidden the two men , but she replied , “ Yes , the men were here earlier , but I did n't know where they were from .
6:2:005:0	They left the town at dusk , as the gates were about to close . I do n't know where they went . If you hurry , you can probably catch up with them . ”
6:2:006:0	( Actually , she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them beneath bundles of flax she had laid out . )
6:2:007:0	So the king 's men went looking for the spies along the road leading to the shallow crossings of the Jordan River . And as soon as the king 's men had left , the gate of Jericho was shut .
6:2:008:0	Before the spies went to sleep that night , Rahab went up on the roof to talk with them .
6:2:009:0	“ I know the Lord has given you this land , ” she told them . “ We are all afraid of you . Everyone in the land is living in terror .
6:2:010:0	For we have heard how the Lord made a dry path for you through the Red Sea when you left Egypt . And we know what you did to Sihon and Og , the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River , whose people you completely destroyed .
6:2:011:0	No wonder our hearts have melted in fear ! No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things . For the Lord your God is the supreme God of the heavens above and the earth below .
6:2:012:0	“ Now swear to me by the Lord that you will be kind to me and my family since I have helped you . Give me some guarantee that
6:2:013:0	when Jericho is conquered , you will let me live , along with my father and mother , my brothers and sisters , and all their families . ”
6:2:014:0	“ We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety , ” the men agreed . “ If you do n't betray us , we will keep our promise and be kind to you when the Lord gives us the land . ”
6:2:015:0	Then , since Rahab 's house was built into the town wall , she let them down by a rope through the window .
6:2:016:0	“ Escape to the hill country , ” she told them . “ Hide there for three days from the men searching for you . Then , when they have returned , you can go on your way . ”
6:2:017:0	Before they left , the men told her , “ We will be bound by the oath we have taken only if you follow these instructions .
6:2:018:0	When we come into the land , you must leave this scarlet rope hanging from the window through which you let us down . And all your family members — your father , mother , brothers , and all your relatives — must be here inside the house .
6:2:019:0	If they go out into the street and are killed , it will not be our fault . But if anyone lays a hand on people inside this house , we will accept the responsibility for their death .
6:2:020:0	If you betray us , however , we are not bound by this oath in any way . ”
6:2:021:0	“ I accept your terms , ” she replied . And she sent them on their way , leaving the scarlet rope hanging from the window .
6:2:022:0	The spies went up into the hill country and stayed there three days . The men who were chasing them searched everywhere along the road , but they finally returned without success .
6:2:023:0	Then the two spies came down from the hill country , crossed the Jordan River , and reported to Joshua all that had happened to them .
6:2:024:0	“ The Lord has given us the whole land , ” they said , “ for all the people in the land are terrified of us . ”
