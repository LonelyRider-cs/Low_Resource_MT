6:3:001:1	The Israelites Cross the Jordan
6:3:001:0	Early the next morning Joshua and all the Israelites left Acacia Grove and arrived at the banks of the Jordan River , where they camped before crossing .
6:3:002:0	Three days later the Israelite officers went through the camp ,
6:3:003:0	giving these instructions to the people : “ When you see the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , move out from your positions and follow them .
6:3:004:0	Since you have never traveled this way before , they will guide you . Stay about half a mile behind them , keeping a clear distance between you and the Ark . Make sure you do n't come any closer . ”
6:3:005:0	Then Joshua told the people , “ Purify yourselves , for tomorrow the Lord will do great wonders among you . ”
6:3:006:0	In the morning Joshua said to the priests , “ Lift up the Ark of the Covenant and lead the people across the river. ” And so they started out and went ahead of the people .
6:3:007:0	The Lord told Joshua , “ Today I will begin to make you a great leader in the eyes of all the Israelites . They will know that I am with you , just as I was with Moses .
6:3:008:0	Give this command to the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant : ‘ When you reach the banks of the Jordan River , take a few steps into the river and stop there . ' ”
6:3:009:0	So Joshua told the Israelites , “ Come and listen to what the Lord your God says .
6:3:010:0	Today you will know that the living God is among you . He will surely drive out the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites , and Jebusites ahead of you .
6:3:011:0	Look , the Ark of the Covenant , which belongs to the Lord of the whole earth , will lead you across the Jordan River !
6:3:012:0	Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel , one from each tribe .
6:3:013:0	The priests will carry the Ark of the Lord , the Lord of all the earth . As soon as their feet touch the water , the flow of water will be cut off upstream , and the river will stand up like a wall . ”
6:3:014:0	So the people left their camp to cross the Jordan , and the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of them .
6:3:015:0	It was the harvest season , and the Jordan was overflowing its banks . But as soon as the feet of the priests who were carrying the Ark touched the water at the river 's edge ,
6:3:016:0	the water above that point began backing up a great distance away at a town called Adam , which is near Zarethan . And the water below that point flowed on to the Dead Sea until the riverbed was dry . Then all the people crossed over near the town of Jericho .
6:3:017:0	Meanwhile , the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant stood on dry ground in the middle of the riverbed as the people passed by . They waited there until the whole nation of Israel had crossed the Jordan on dry ground .
