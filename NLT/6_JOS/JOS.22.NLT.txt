6:22:001:1	The Eastern Tribes Return Home
6:22:001:0	Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh .
6:22:002:0	He told them , “ You have done as Moses , the servant of the Lord , commanded you , and you have obeyed every order I have given you .
6:22:003:0	During all this time you have not deserted the other tribes . You have been careful to obey the commands of the Lord your God right up to the present day .
6:22:004:0	And now the Lord your God has given the other tribes rest , as he promised them . So go back home to the land that Moses , the servant of the Lord , gave you as your possession on the east side of the Jordan River .
6:22:005:0	But be very careful to obey all the commands and the instructions that Moses gave to you . Love the Lord your God , walk in all his ways , obey his commands , hold firmly to him , and serve him with all your heart and all your soul . ”
6:22:006:0	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away , and they went home .
6:22:007:0	Moses had given the land of Bashan , east of the Jordan River , to the half-tribe of Manasseh . ( The other half of the tribe was given land west of the Jordan . ) As Joshua sent them away and blessed them ,
6:22:008:0	he said to them , “ Go back to your homes with the great wealth you have taken from your enemies—the vast herds of livestock , the silver , gold , bronze , and iron , and the large supply of clothing . Share the plunder with your relatives . ”
6:22:002:1	The Eastern Tribes Build an Altar
6:22:009:0	So the men of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the rest of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan . They started the journey back to their own land of Gilead , the territory that belonged to them according to the Lord 's command through Moses .
6:22:010:0	But while they were still in Canaan , and when they came to a place called Geliloth near the Jordan River , the men of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh stopped to build a large and imposing altar .
6:22:011:0	The rest of Israel heard that the people of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar at Geliloth at the edge of the land of Canaan , on the west side of the Jordan River .
6:22:012:0	So the whole community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and prepared to go to war against them .
6:22:013:0	First , however , they sent a delegation led by Phinehas son of Eleazar , the priest , to talk with the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh .
6:22:014:0	In this delegation were ten leaders of Israel , one from each of the ten tribes , and each the head of his family within the clans of Israel .
6:22:015:0	When they arrived in the land of Gilead , they said to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh ,
6:22:016:0	“ The whole community of the Lord demands to know why you are betraying the God of Israel . How could you turn away from the Lord and build an altar for yourselves in rebellion against him ?
6:22:017:0	Was our sin at Peor not enough ? To this day we are not fully cleansed of it , even after the plague that struck the entire community of the Lord .
6:22:018:0	And yet today you are turning away from following the Lord . If you rebel against the Lord today , he will be angry with all of us tomorrow .
6:22:019:0	“ If you need the altar because the land you possess is defiled , then join us in the Lord 's land , where the Tabernacle of the Lord is situated , and share our land with us . But do not rebel against the Lord or against us by building an altar other than the one true altar of the Lord our God .
6:22:020:0	Did n't divine anger fall on the entire community of Israel when Achan , a member of the clan of Zerah , sinned by stealing the things set apart for the Lord ? He was not the only one who died because of his sin . ”
6:22:021:0	Then the people of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the clans of Israel :
6:22:022:0	“ The Lord , the Mighty One , is God ! The Lord , the Mighty One , is God ! He knows the truth , and may Israel know it , too ! We have not built the altar in treacherous rebellion against the Lord . If we have done so , do not spare our lives this day .
6:22:023:0	If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from the Lord or to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings , may the Lord himself punish us .
6:22:024:0	“ The truth is , we have built this altar because we fear that in the future your descendants will say to ours , ‘ What right do you have to worship the Lord , the God of Israel ?
6:22:025:0	The Lord has placed the Jordan River as a barrier between our people and you people of Reuben and Gad . You have no claim to the Lord . ' So your descendants may prevent our descendants from worshiping the Lord .
6:22:026:0	“ So we decided to build the altar , not for burnt offerings or sacrifices ,
6:22:027:0	but as a memorial . It will remind our descendants and your descendants that we , too , have the right to worship the Lord at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings , sacrifices , and peace offerings . Then your descendants will not be able to say to ours , ‘ You have no claim to the Lord . '
6:22:028:0	“ If they say this , our descendants can reply , ‘ Look at this copy of the Lord 's altar that our ancestors made . It is not for burnt offerings or sacrifices ; it is a reminder of the relationship both of us have with the Lord . '
6:22:029:0	Far be it from us to rebel against the Lord or turn away from him by building our own altar for burnt offerings , grain offerings , or sacrifices . Only the altar of the Lord our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle may be used for that purpose . ”
6:22:030:0	When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community—the heads of the clans of Israel—heard this from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh , they were satisfied .
6:22:031:0	Phinehas son of Eleazar , the priest , replied to them , “ Today we know the Lord is among us because you have not committed this treachery against the Lord as we thought . Instead , you have rescued Israel from being destroyed by the hand of the Lord . ”
6:22:032:0	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar , the priest , and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened .
6:22:033:0	And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad .
6:22:034:0	The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “ Witness , ” for they said , “ It is a witness between us and them that the Lord is our God , too . ”
