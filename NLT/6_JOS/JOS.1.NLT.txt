6:1:001:1	The
6:1:002:1	Lord
6:1:003:1	's Charge to Joshua
6:1:001:0	After the death of Moses the Lord 's servant , the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun , Moses ' assistant . He said ,
6:1:002:0	“ Moses my servant is dead . Therefore , the time has come for you to lead these people , the Israelites , across the Jordan River into the land I am giving them .
6:1:003:0	I promise you what I promised Moses : ‘ Wherever you set foot , you will be on land I have given you —
6:1:004:0	from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north , from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west , including all the land of the Hittites . '
6:1:005:0	No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live . For I will be with you as I was with Moses . I will not fail you or abandon you .
6:1:006:0	“ Be strong and courageous , for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them .
6:1:007:0	Be strong and very courageous . Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you . Do not deviate from them , turning either to the right or to the left . Then you will be successful in everything you do .
6:1:008:0	Study this Book of Instruction continually . Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it . Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do .
6:1:004:1	Joshua 's Charge to the Israelites
6:1:009:0	This is my command — be strong and courageous ! Do not be afraid or discouraged . For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go . ”
6:1:010:0	Joshua then commanded the officers of Israel ,
6:1:011:0	“ Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready . In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you . ”
6:1:012:0	Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh . He told them ,
6:1:013:0	“ Remember what Moses , the servant of the Lord , commanded you : ‘ The Lord your God is giving you a place of rest . He has given you this land . '
6:1:014:0	Your wives , children , and livestock may remain here in the land Moses assigned to you on the east side of the Jordan River . But your strong warriors , fully armed , must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory . Stay with them
6:1:015:0	until the Lord gives them rest , as he has given you rest , and until they , too , possess the land the Lord your God is giving them . Only then may you return and settle here on the east side of the Jordan River in the land that Moses , the servant of the Lord , assigned to you . ”
6:1:016:0	They answered Joshua , “ We will do whatever you command us , and we will go wherever you send us .
6:1:017:0	We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses . And may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses .
6:1:018:0	Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey your words and everything you command will be put to death . So be strong and courageous ! ”
