6:21:001:1	The Towns Given to the Levites
6:21:001:0	Then the leaders of the tribe of Levi came to consult with Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and the leaders of the other tribes of Israel .
6:21:002:0	They came to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said , “ The Lord commanded Moses to give us towns to live in and pasturelands for our livestock . ”
6:21:003:0	So by the command of the Lord the people of Israel gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own grants of land .
6:21:004:0	The descendants of Aaron , who were members of the Kohathite clan within the tribe of Levi , were allotted thirteen towns that were originally assigned to the tribes of Judah , Simeon , and Benjamin .

6:21:007:0	The clan of Merari was allotted twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Zebulun .
6:21:008:0	So the Israelites obeyed the Lord 's command to Moses and assigned these towns and pasturelands to the Levites by casting sacred lots .
6:21:009:0	The Israelites gave the following towns from the tribes of Judah and Simeon
6:21:010:0	to the descendants of Aaron , who were members of the Kohathite clan within the tribe of Levi , since the sacred lot fell to them first :
6:21:011:0	Kiriath-arba ( that is , Hebron ) , in the hill country of Judah , along with its surrounding pasturelands . ( Arba was an ancestor of Anak . )
6:21:012:0	But the open fields beyond the town and the surrounding villages were given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession .

6:21:018:0	Anathoth , and Almon—four towns .

6:21:020:0	The rest of the Kohathite clan from the tribe of Levi was allotted the following towns and pasturelands from the tribe of Ephraim :

6:21:025:0	The half-tribe of Manasseh allotted the following towns with their pasturelands to the priests : Taanach and Gath-rimmon—two towns .
6:21:026:0	So in all , ten towns with their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clan .
6:21:027:0	The descendants of Gershon , another clan within the tribe of Levi , received the following towns with their pasturelands from the half-tribe of Manasseh : Golan in Bashan ( a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone ) and Be-eshterah—two towns .

6:21:033:0	So in all , thirteen towns with their pasturelands were allotted to the clan of Gershon .
6:21:034:0	The rest of the Levites—the Merari clan—were given the following towns with their pasturelands from the tribe of Zebulun : Jokneam , Kartah ,
6:21:035:0	Dimnah , and Nahalal—four towns .
6:21:036:0	From the tribe of Reuben they received the following towns with their pasturelands : Bezer , Jahaz ,

6:21:041:0	The total number of towns and pasturelands within Israelite territory given to the Levites came to forty-eight .
6:21:042:0	Every one of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it .
6:21:043:0	So the Lord gave to Israel all the land he had sworn to give their ancestors , and they took possession of it and settled there .
6:21:044:0	And the Lord gave them rest on every side , just as he had solemnly promised their ancestors . None of their enemies could stand against them , for the Lord helped them conquer all their enemies .
6:21:045:0	Not a single one of all the good promises the Lord had given to the family of Israel was left unfulfilled ; everything he had spoken came true .
