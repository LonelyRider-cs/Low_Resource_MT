6:8:001:1	The Israelites Defeat Ai
6:8:001:0	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Do not be afraid or discouraged . Take all your fighting men and attack Ai , for I have given you the king of Ai , his people , his town , and his land .
6:8:002:0	You will destroy them as you destroyed Jericho and its king . But this time you may keep the plunder and the livestock for yourselves . Set an ambush behind the town . ”
6:8:003:0	So Joshua and all the fighting men set out to attack Ai . Joshua chose 30,000 of his best warriors and sent them out at night
6:8:004:0	with these orders : “ Hide in ambush close behind the town and be ready for action .
6:8:005:0	When our main army attacks , the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before , and we will run away from them .
6:8:006:0	We will let them chase us until we have drawn them away from the town . For they will say , ‘ The Israelites are running away from us as they did before . ' Then , while we are running from them ,
6:8:007:0	you will jump up from your ambush and take possession of the town , for the Lord your God will give it to you .
6:8:008:0	Set the town on fire , as the Lord has commanded . You have your orders . ”
6:8:009:0	So they left and went to the place of ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai . But Joshua remained among the people in the camp that night .
6:8:010:0	Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai , accompanied by the elders of Israel .
6:8:011:0	All the fighting men who were with Joshua marched in front of the town and camped on the north side of Ai , with a valley between them and the town .
6:8:012:0	That night Joshua sent about 5,000 men to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of the town .
6:8:013:0	So they stationed the main army north of the town and the ambush west of the town . Joshua himself spent that night in the valley .
6:8:014:0	When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley , he and all his army hurried out early in the morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley . But he did n't realize there was an ambush behind the town .
6:8:015:0	Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly beaten .
6:8:016:0	Then all the men in the town were called out to chase after them . In this way , they were lured away from the town .
6:8:017:0	There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not chase after the Israelites , and the town was left wide open .
6:8:018:0	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Point the spear in your hand toward Ai , for I will hand the town over to you. ” Joshua did as he was commanded .
6:8:019:0	As soon as Joshua gave this signal , all the men in ambush jumped up from their position and poured into the town . They quickly captured it and set it on fire .
6:8:020:0	When the men of Ai looked behind them , smoke from the town was filling the sky , and they had nowhere to go . For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their pursuers .
6:8:021:0	When Joshua and all the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from the town , they turned and attacked the men of Ai .
6:8:022:0	Meanwhile , the Israelites who were inside the town came out and attacked the enemy from the rear . So the men of Ai were caught in the middle , with Israelite fighters on both sides . Israel attacked them , and not a single person survived or escaped .
6:8:023:0	Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua .
6:8:024:0	When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields , they went back and finished off everyone inside .
6:8:025:0	So the entire population of Ai , including men and women , was wiped out that day—12,000 in all .
6:8:026:0	For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed .
6:8:027:0	Only the livestock and the treasures of the town were not destroyed , for the Israelites kept these as plunder for themselves , as the Lord had commanded Joshua .
6:8:028:0	So Joshua burned the town of Ai , and it became a permanent mound of ruins , desolate to this very day .
6:8:002:1	The
6:8:003:1	Lord
6:8:004:1	's Covenant Renewed
6:8:029:0	Joshua impaled the king of Ai on a sharpened pole and left him there until evening . At sunset the Israelites took down the body , as Joshua commanded , and threw it in front of the town gate . They piled a great heap of stones over him that can still be seen today .
6:8:030:0	Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord , the God of Israel , on Mount Ebal .
6:8:031:0	He followed the commands that Moses the Lord 's servant had written in the Book of Instruction : “ Make me an altar from stones that are uncut and have not been shaped with iron tools. ” Then on the altar they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord .
6:8:032:0	And as the Israelites watched , Joshua copied onto the stones of the altar the instructions Moses had given them .
6:8:033:0	Then all the Israelites—foreigners and native-born alike—along with the elders , officers , and judges , were divided into two groups . One group stood in front of Mount Gerizim , the other in front of Mount Ebal . Each group faced the other , and between them stood the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant . This was all done according to the commands that Moses , the servant of the Lord , had previously given for blessing the people of Israel .
6:8:034:0	Joshua then read to them all the blessings and curses Moses had written in the Book of Instruction .
6:8:035:0	Every word of every command that Moses had ever given was read to the entire assembly of Israel , including the women and children and the foreigners who lived among them .
