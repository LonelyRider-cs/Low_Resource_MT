6:14:001:1	The Land Divided West of the Jordan
6:14:001:0	The remaining tribes of Israel received land in Canaan as allotted by Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and the tribal leaders .
6:14:002:0	These nine and a half tribes received their grants of land by means of sacred lots , in accordance with the Lord 's command through Moses .
6:14:003:0	Moses had already given a grant of land to the two and a half tribes on the east side of the Jordan River , but he had given the Levites no such allotment .
6:14:004:0	The descendants of Joseph had become two separate tribes — Manasseh and Ephraim . And the Levites were given no land at all , only towns to live in with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock and all their possessions .
6:14:002:1	Caleb Requests His Land
6:14:005:0	So the land was distributed in strict accordance with the Lord 's commands to Moses .
6:14:006:0	A delegation from the tribe of Judah , led by Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite , came to Joshua at Gilgal . Caleb said to Joshua , “ Remember what the Lord said to Moses , the man of God , about you and me when we were at Kadesh-barnea .
6:14:007:0	I was forty years old when Moses , the servant of the Lord , sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land of Canaan . I returned and gave an honest report ,
6:14:008:0	but my brothers who went with me frightened the people from entering the Promised Land . For my part , I wholeheartedly followed the Lord my God .
6:14:009:0	So that day Moses solemnly promised me , ‘ The land of Canaan on which you were just walking will be your grant of land and that of your descendants forever , because you wholeheartedly followed the Lord my God . '
6:14:010:0	“ Now , as you can see , the Lord has kept me alive and well as he promised for all these forty-five years since Moses made this promise — even while Israel wandered in the wilderness . Today I am eighty-five years old .
6:14:011:0	I am as strong now as I was when Moses sent me on that journey , and I can still travel and fight as well as I could then .
6:14:012:0	So give me the hill country that the Lord promised me . You will remember that as scouts we found the descendants of Anak living there in great , walled towns . But if the Lord is with me , I will drive them out of the land , just as the Lord said . ”
6:14:013:0	So Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave Hebron to him as his portion of land .
6:14:014:0	Hebron still belongs to the descendants of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite because he wholeheartedly followed the Lord , the God of Israel .
6:14:015:0	( Previously Hebron had been called Kiriath-arba . It had been named after Arba , a great hero of the descendants of Anak . ) And the land had rest from war .
