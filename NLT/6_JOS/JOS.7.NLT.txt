6:7:001:1	Ai Defeats the Israelites
6:7:001:0	But Israel violated the instructions about the things set apart for the Lord . A man named Achan had stolen some of these dedicated things , so the Lord was very angry with the Israelites . Achan was the son of Carmi , a descendant of Zimri son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah .
6:7:002:0	Joshua sent some of his men from Jericho to spy out the town of Ai , east of Bethel , near Beth-aven .
6:7:003:0	When they returned , they told Joshua , “ There 's no need for all of us to go up there ; it wo n't take more than two or three thousand men to attack Ai . Since there are so few of them , do n't make all our people struggle to go up there . ”
6:7:004:0	So approximately 3,000 warriors were sent , but they were soundly defeated . The men of Ai
6:7:005:0	chased the Israelites from the town gate as far as the quarries , and they killed about thirty-six who were retreating down the slope . The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events , and their courage melted away .
6:7:006:0	Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothing in dismay , threw dust on their heads , and bowed face down to the ground before the Ark of the Lord until evening .
6:7:007:0	Then Joshua cried out , “ Oh , Sovereign Lord , why did you bring us across the Jordan River if you are going to let the Amorites kill us ? If only we had been content to stay on the other side !
6:7:008:0	Lord , what can I say now that Israel has fled from its enemies ?
6:7:009:0	For when the Canaanites and all the other people living in the land hear about it , they will surround us and wipe our name off the face of the earth . And then what will happen to the honor of your great name ? ”
6:7:010:0	But the Lord said to Joshua , “ Get up ! Why are you lying on your face like this ?
6:7:011:0	Israel has sinned and broken my covenant ! They have stolen some of the things that I commanded must be set apart for me . And they have not only stolen them but have lied about it and hidden the things among their own belongings .
6:7:012:0	That is why the Israelites are running from their enemies in defeat . For now Israel itself has been set apart for destruction . I will not remain with you any longer unless you destroy the things among you that were set apart for destruction .
6:7:013:0	“ Get up ! Command the people to purify themselves in preparation for tomorrow . For this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Hidden among you , O Israel , are things set apart for the Lord . You will never defeat your enemies until you remove these things from among you .
6:7:014:0	“ In the morning you must present yourselves by tribes , and the Lord will point out the tribe to which the guilty man belongs . That tribe must come forward with its clans , and the Lord will point out the guilty clan . That clan will then come forward , and the Lord will point out the guilty family . Finally , each member of the guilty family must come forward one by one .
6:7:002:1	Achan 's Sin
6:7:015:0	The one who has stolen what was set apart for destruction will himself be burned with fire , along with everything he has , for he has broken the covenant of the Lord and has done a horrible thing in Israel . ”
6:7:016:0	Early the next morning Joshua brought the tribes of Israel before the Lord , and the tribe of Judah was singled out .
6:7:017:0	Then the clans of Judah came forward , and the clan of Zerah was singled out . Then the families of Zerah came forward , and the family of Zimri was singled out .
6:7:018:0	Every member of Zimri 's family was brought forward person by person , and Achan was singled out .
6:7:019:0	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , give glory to the Lord , the God of Israel , by telling the truth . Make your confession and tell me what you have done . Do n't hide it from me . ”
6:7:020:0	Achan replied , “ It is true ! I have sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel .
6:7:021:0	Among the plunder I saw a beautiful robe from Babylon , 200 silver coins , and a bar of gold weighing more than a pound . I wanted them so much that I took them . They are hidden in the ground beneath my tent , with the silver buried deeper than the rest . ”
6:7:022:0	So Joshua sent some men to make a search . They ran to the tent and found the stolen goods hidden there , just as Achan had said , with the silver buried beneath the rest .
6:7:023:0	They took the things from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites . Then they laid them on the ground in the presence of the Lord .
6:7:024:0	Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan , the silver , the robe , the bar of gold , his sons , daughters , cattle , donkeys , sheep , goats , tent , and everything he had , and they brought them to the valley of Achor .
6:7:025:0	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ Why have you brought trouble on us ? The Lord will now bring trouble on you. ” And all the Israelites stoned Achan and his family and burned their bodies .
6:7:026:0	They piled a great heap of stones over Achan , which remains to this day . That is why the place has been called the Valley of Trouble ever since . So the Lord was no longer angry .
