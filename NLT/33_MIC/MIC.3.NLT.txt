33:3:001:1	Judgment against Israel 's Leaders
33:3:001:0	I said , “ Listen , you leaders of Israel ! You are supposed to know right from wrong ,
33:3:002:0	but you are the very oneswho hate good and love evil.You skin my people aliveand tear the flesh from their bones .
33:3:003:0	Yes , you eat my people 's flesh , strip off their skin , and break their bones.You chop them uplike meat for the cooking pot .
33:3:004:0	Then you beg the Lord for help in times of trouble ! Do you really expect him to answer ? After all the evil you have done , he wo n't even look at you ! ”
33:3:005:0	This is what the Lord says : “ You false prophets are leading my people astray ! You promise peace for those who give you food , but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you .
33:3:006:0	Now the night will close around you , cutting off all your visions.Darkness will cover you , putting an end to your predictions.The sun will set for you prophets , and your day will come to an end .
33:3:007:0	Then you seers will be put to shame , and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.And you will cover your facesbecause there is no answer from God . ”
33:3:008:0	But as for me , I am filled with power—with the Spirit of the Lord.I am filled with justice and strengthto boldly declare Israel 's sin and rebellion .
33:3:009:0	Listen to me , you leaders of Israel ! You hate justice and twist all that is right .
33:3:010:0	You are building Jerusalemon a foundation of murder and corruption .
33:3:011:0	You rulers make decisions based on bribes ; you priests teach God 's laws only for a price ; you prophets wo n't prophesy unless you are paid.Yet all of you claim to depend on the Lord. “ No harm can come to us , ” you say , “ for the Lord is here among us . ”
33:3:012:0	Because of you , Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field ; Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins ! A thicket will grow on the heightswhere the Temple now stands .
