33:6:001:1	The
33:6:002:1	Lord
33:6:003:1	's Case against Israel
33:6:001:0	Listen to what the Lord is saying : “ Stand up and state your case against me.Let the mountains and hills be called to witness your complaints .
33:6:002:0	And now , O mountains , listen to the Lord 's complaint ! He has a case against his people.He will bring charges against Israel .
33:6:003:0	“ O my people , what have I done to you ? What have I done to make you tired of me ? Answer me !
33:6:004:0	For I brought you out of Egyptand redeemed you from slavery.I sent Moses , Aaron , and Miriam to help you .
33:6:005:0	Do n't you remember , my people , how King Balak of Moab tried to have you cursedand how Balaam son of Beor blessed you instead ? And remember your journey from Acacia Grove to Gilgal , when I , the Lord , did everything I couldto teach you about my faithfulness . ”
33:6:006:0	What can we bring to the Lord ? Should we bring him burnt offerings ? Should we bow before God Most Highwith offerings of yearling calves ?
33:6:007:0	Should we offer him thousands of ramsand ten thousand rivers of olive oil ? Should we sacrifice our firstborn childrento pay for our sins ?
33:6:004:1	Israel 's Guilt and Punishment
33:6:008:0	No , O people , the Lord has told you what is good , and this is what he requires of you : to do what is right , to love mercy , and to walk humbly with your God .
33:6:009:0	Fear the Lord if you are wise ! His voice calls to everyone in Jerusalem : “ The armies of destruction are coming ; the Lord is sending them .
33:6:010:0	What shall I say about the homes of the wickedfilled with treasures gained by cheating ? What about the disgusting practiceof measuring out grain with dishonest measures ?
33:6:011:0	How can I tolerate your merchantswho use dishonest scales and weights ?
33:6:012:0	The rich among you have become wealthythrough extortion and violence.Your citizens are so used to lyingthat their tongues can no longer tell the truth .
33:6:013:0	“ Therefore , I will wound you ! I will bring you to ruin for all your sins .
33:6:014:0	You will eat but never have enough.Your hunger pangs and emptiness will remain.And though you try to save your money , it will come to nothing in the end.You will save a little , but I will give it to those who conquer you .
33:6:015:0	You will plant cropsbut not harvest them.You will press your olivesbut not get enough oil to anoint yourselves.You will trample the grapesbut get no juice to make your wine .
33:6:016:0	You keep only the laws of evil King Omri ; you follow only the example of wicked King Ahab ! Therefore , I will make an example of you , bringing you to complete ruin.You will be treated with contempt , mocked by all who see you . ”
