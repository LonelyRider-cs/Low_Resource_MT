33:1:001:1	Grief over Samaria and Jerusalem
33:1:001:0	The Lord gave this message to Micah of Moresheth during the years when Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah were kings of Judah . The visions he saw concerned both Samaria and Jerusalem .
33:1:002:0	Attention ! Let all the people of the world listen ! Let the earth and everything in it hear.The Sovereign Lord is making accusations against you ; the Lord speaks from his holy Temple .
33:1:003:0	Look ! The Lord is coming ! He leaves his throne in heavenand tramples the heights of the earth .
33:1:004:0	The mountains melt beneath his feetand flow into the valleyslike wax in a fire , like water pouring down a hill .
33:1:005:0	And why is this happening ? Because of the rebellion of Israel — yes , the sins of the whole nation.Who is to blame for Israel 's rebellion ? Samaria , its capital city ! Where is the center of idolatry in Judah ? In Jerusalem , its capital !
33:1:006:0	“ So I , the Lord , will make the city of Samariaa heap of ruins.Her streets will be plowed upfor planting vineyards.I will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below , exposing her foundations .
33:1:007:0	All her carved images will be smashed.All her sacred treasures will be burned.These things were bought with the moneyearned by her prostitution , and they will now be carried awayto pay prostitutes elsewhere . ”
33:1:008:0	Therefore , I will mourn and lament.I will walk around barefoot and naked.I will howl like a jackaland moan like an owl .
33:1:009:0	For my people 's woundis too deep to heal.It has reached into Judah , even to the gates of Jerusalem .
33:1:010:0	Do n't tell our enemies in Gath ; do n't weep at all.You people in Beth-leaphrah , roll in the dust to show your despair .
33:1:011:0	You people in Shaphir , go as captives into exile — naked and ashamed.The people of Zaanandare not come outside their walls.The people of Beth-ezel mourn , for their house has no support .
33:1:012:0	The people of Maroth anxiously wait for relief , but only bitterness awaits themas the Lord 's judgment reacheseven to the gates of Jerusalem .
33:1:013:0	Harness your chariot horses and flee , you people of Lachish.You were the first city in Judahto follow Israel in her rebellion , and you led Jerusalem into sin .
33:1:014:0	Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath ; there is no hope of saving it.The town of Aczibhas deceived the kings of Israel .
33:1:015:0	O people of Mareshah , I will bring a conqueror to capture your town.And the leaders of Israelwill go to Adullam .
33:1:016:0	Oh , people of Judah , shave your heads in sorrow , for the children you love will be snatched away.Make yourselves as bald as a vulture , for your little ones will be exiled to distant lands .
