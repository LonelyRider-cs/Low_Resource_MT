33:5:001:1	A Ruler from Bethlehem
33:5:001:0	Mobilize ! Marshal your troops ! The enemy is laying siege to Jerusalem.They will strike Israel 's leaderin the face with a rod .
33:5:002:0	But you , O Bethlehem Ephrathah , are only a small village among all the people of Judah.Yet a ruler of Israel , whose origins are in the distant past , will come from you on my behalf .
33:5:003:0	The people of Israel will be abandoned to their enemiesuntil the woman in labor gives birth.Then at last his fellow countrymenwill return from exile to their own land .
33:5:004:0	And he will stand to lead his flock with the Lord 's strength , in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God.Then his people will live there undisturbed , for he will be highly honored around the world .
33:5:005:0	And he will be the source of peace.When the Assyrians invade our landand break through our defenses , we will appoint seven rulers to watch over us , eight princes to lead us .
33:5:002:1	The Remnant Purified
33:5:006:0	They will rule Assyria with drawn swordsand enter the gates of the land of Nimrod.He will rescue us from the Assyrianswhen they pour over the borders to invade our land .
33:5:007:0	Then the remnant left in Israelwill take their place among the nations.They will be like dew sent by the Lordor like rain falling on the grass , which no one can hold backand no one can restrain .
33:5:008:0	The remnant left in Israelwill take their place among the nations.They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest , like a strong young lion among flocks of sheep and goats , pouncing and tearing as they gowith no rescuer in sight .
33:5:009:0	The people of Israel will stand up to their foes , and all their enemies will be wiped out .
33:5:010:0	“ In that day , ” says the Lord , “ I will slaughter your horsesand destroy your chariots .
33:5:011:0	I will tear down your wallsand demolish your defenses .
33:5:012:0	I will put an end to all witchcraft , and there will be no more fortune-tellers .
33:5:013:0	I will destroy all your idols and sacred pillars , so you will never again worship the work of your own hands .
33:5:014:0	I will abolish your idol shrines with their Asherah polesand destroy your pagan cities .
33:5:015:0	I will pour out my vengeanceon all the nations that refuse to obey me . ”
