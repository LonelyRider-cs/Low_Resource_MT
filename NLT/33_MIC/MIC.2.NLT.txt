33:2:001:1	Judgment against Wealthy Oppressors
33:2:001:0	What sorrow awaits you who lie awake at night , thinking up evil plans.You rise at dawn and hurry to carry them out , simply because you have the power to do so .
33:2:002:0	When you want a piece of land , you find a way to seize it.When you want someone 's house , you take it by fraud and violence.You cheat a man of his property , stealing his family 's inheritance .
33:2:003:0	But this is what the Lord says : “ I will reward your evil with evil ; you wo n't be able to pull your neck out of the noose.You will no longer walk around proudly , for it will be a terrible time . ”
33:2:004:0	In that day your enemies will make fun of youby singing this song of despair about you : “ We are finished , completely ruined ! God has confiscated our land , taking it from us.He has given our fieldsto those who betrayed us . ”
33:2:002:1	True and False Prophets
33:2:005:0	Others will set your boundaries then , and the Lord 's people will have no sayin how the land is divided .
33:2:006:0	“ Do n't say such things , ” the people respond. “ Do n't prophesy like that.Such disasters will never come our way ! ”
33:2:007:0	Should you talk that way , O family of Israel ? Will the Lord 's Spirit have patience with such behavior ? If you would do what is right , you would find my words comforting .
33:2:008:0	Yet to this very hourmy people rise against me like an enemy ! You steal the shirts right off the backsof those who trusted you , making them as ragged as menreturning from battle .
33:2:009:0	You have evicted women from their pleasant homesand forever stripped their children of all that God would give them .
33:2:010:0	Up ! Begone ! This is no longer your land and home , for you have filled it with sinand ruined it completely .
33:2:003:1	Hope for Restoration
33:2:011:0	Suppose a prophet full of lies would say to you , “ I 'll preach to you the joys of wine and alcohol ! ” That 's just the kind of prophet you would like !
33:2:012:0	“ Someday , O Israel , I will gather you ; I will gather the remnant who are left.I will bring you together again like sheep in a pen , like a flock in its pasture.Yes , your land will againbe filled with noisy crowds !
33:2:013:0	Your leader will break outand lead you out of exile , out through the gates of the enemy cities , back to your own land.Your king will lead you ; the Lord himself will guide you . ”
