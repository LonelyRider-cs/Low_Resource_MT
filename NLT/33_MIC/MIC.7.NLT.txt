33:7:001:1	Misery Turned to Hope
33:7:001:0	How miserable I am ! I feel like the fruit picker after the harvestwho can find nothing to eat.Not a cluster of grapes or a single early figcan be found to satisfy my hunger .
33:7:002:0	The godly people have all disappeared ; not one honest person is left on the earth.They are all murderers , setting traps even for their own brothers .
33:7:003:0	Both their hands are equally skilled at doing evil ! Officials and judges alike demand bribes.The people with influence get what they want , and together they scheme to twist justice .
33:7:004:0	Even the best of them is like a brier ; the most honest is as dangerous as a hedge of thorns.But your judgment day is coming swiftly now.Your time of punishment is here , a time of confusion .
33:7:005:0	Do n't trust anyone — not your best friend or even your wife !
33:7:006:0	For the son despises his father.The daughter defies her mother.The daughter-in-law defies her mother-in-law.Your enemies are right in your own household !
33:7:007:0	As for me , I look to the Lord for help.I wait confidently for God to save me , and my God will certainly hear me .
33:7:008:0	Do not gloat over me , my enemies ! For though I fall , I will rise again.Though I sit in darkness , the Lord will be my light .
33:7:009:0	I will be patient as the Lord punishes me , for I have sinned against him.But after that , he will take up my caseand give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies.The Lord will bring me into the light , and I will see his righteousness .
33:7:010:0	Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side.They will be ashamed that they taunted me , saying , “ So where is the Lord — that God of yours ? ” With my own eyes I will see their downfall ; they will be trampled like mud in the streets .
33:7:011:0	In that day , Israel , your cities will be rebuilt , and your borders will be extended .
33:7:012:0	People from many lands will come and honor you — from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt , from Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River , and from distant seas and mountains .
33:7:002:1	The
33:7:003:1	Lord
33:7:004:1	's Compassion on Israel
33:7:013:0	But the land will become empty and desolatebecause of the wickedness of those who live there .
33:7:014:0	O Lord , protect your people with your shepherd 's staff ; lead your flock , your special possession.Though they live alone in a thicketon the heights of Mount Carmel , let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gileadas they did long ago .
33:7:015:0	“ Yes , ” says the Lord , “ I will do mighty miracles for you , like those I did when I rescued youfrom slavery in Egypt . ”
33:7:016:0	All the nations of the world will stand amazedat what the Lord will do for you.They will be embarrassedat their feeble power.They will cover their mouths in silent awe , deaf to everything around them .
33:7:017:0	Like snakes crawling from their holes , they will come out to meet the Lord our God.They will fear him greatly , trembling in terror at his presence .
33:7:018:0	Where is another God like you , who pardons the guilt of the remnant , overlooking the sins of his special people ? You will not stay angry with your people forever , because you delight in showing unfailing love .
33:7:019:0	Once again you will have compassion on us.You will trample our sins under your feetand throw them into the depths of the ocean !
33:7:020:0	You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing loveas you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago .
