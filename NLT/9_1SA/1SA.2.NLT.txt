9:2:001:1	Hannah 's Prayer of Praise
9:2:001:0	Then Hannah prayed : “ My heart rejoices in the Lord ! The Lord has made me strong.Now I have an answer for my enemies ; I rejoice because you rescued me .
9:2:002:0	No one is holy like the Lord ! There is no one besides you ; there is no Rock like our God .
9:2:003:0	“ Stop acting so proud and haughty ! Do n't speak with such arrogance ! For the Lord is a God who knows what you have done ; he will judge your actions .
9:2:004:0	The bow of the mighty is now broken , and those who stumbled are now strong .
9:2:005:0	Those who were well fed are now starving , and those who were starving are now full.The childless woman now has seven children , and the woman with many children wastes away .
9:2:006:0	The Lord gives both death and life ; he brings some down to the grave but raises others up .
9:2:007:0	The Lord makes some poor and others rich ; he brings some down and lifts others up .
9:2:008:0	He lifts the poor from the dustand the needy from the garbage dump.He sets them among princes , placing them in seats of honor.For all the earth is the Lord 's , and he has set the world in order .
9:2:009:0	“ He will protect his faithful ones , but the wicked will disappear in darkness.No one will succeed by strength alone .
9:2:010:0	Those who fight against the Lord will be shattered.He thunders against them from heaven ; the Lord judges throughout the earth.He gives power to his king ; he increases the strength of his anointed one . ”
9:2:002:1	Eli 's Wicked Sons
9:2:011:0	Then Elkanah returned home to Ramah without Samuel . And the boy served the Lord by assisting Eli the priest .
9:2:012:0	Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels who had no respect for the Lord
9:2:013:0	or for their duties as priests . Whenever anyone offered a sacrifice , Eli 's sons would send over a servant with a three-pronged fork . While the meat of the sacrificed animal was still boiling ,
9:2:014:0	the servant would stick the fork into the pot and demand that whatever it brought up be given to Eli 's sons . All the Israelites who came to worship at Shiloh were treated this way .
9:2:015:0	Sometimes the servant would come even before the animal 's fat had been burned on the altar . He would demand raw meat before it had been boiled so that it could be used for roasting .
9:2:016:0	The man offering the sacrifice might reply , “ Take as much as you want , but the fat must be burned first. ” Then the servant would demand , “ No , give it to me now , or I 'll take it by force . ”
9:2:017:0	So the sin of these young men was very serious in the Lord 's sight , for they treated the Lord 's offerings with contempt .
9:2:018:0	But Samuel , though he was only a boy , served the Lord . He wore a linen garment like that of a priest .
9:2:019:0	Each year his mother made a small coat for him and brought it to him when she came with her husband for the sacrifice .
9:2:020:0	Before they returned home , Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say , “ May the Lord give you other children to take the place of this one she gave to the Lord . ”
9:2:021:0	And the Lord blessed Hannah , and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters . Meanwhile , Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord .
9:2:022:0	Now Eli was very old , but he was aware of what his sons were doing to the people of Israel . He knew , for instance , that his sons were seducing the young women who assisted at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
9:2:023:0	Eli said to them , “ I have been hearing reports from all the people about the wicked things you are doing . Why do you keep sinning ?
9:2:024:0	You must stop , my sons ! The reports I hear among the Lord 's people are not good .
9:2:025:0	If someone sins against another person , God can mediate for the guilty party . But if someone sins against the Lord , who can intercede ? ” But Eli 's sons would n't listen to their father , for the Lord was already planning to put them to death .
9:2:003:1	A Warning for Eli 's Family
9:2:026:0	Meanwhile , the boy Samuel grew taller and grew in favor with the Lord and with the people .
9:2:027:0	One day a man of God came to Eli and gave him this message from the Lord : “ I revealed myself to your ancestors when they were Pharaoh 's slaves in Egypt .
9:2:028:0	I chose your ancestor Aaron from among all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to offer sacrifices on my altar , to burn incense , and to wear the priestly vest as he served me . And I assigned the sacrificial offerings to you priests .
9:2:029:0	So why do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings ? Why do you give your sons more honor than you give me — for you and they have become fat from the best offerings of my people Israel !
9:2:030:0	“ Therefore , the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I promised that your branch of the tribe of Levi would always be my priests . But I will honor those who honor me , and I will despise those who think lightly of me .
9:2:031:0	The time is coming when I will put an end to your family , so it will no longer serve as my priests . All the members of your family will die before their time . None will reach old age .
9:2:032:0	You will watch with envy as I pour out prosperity on the people of Israel . But no members of your family will ever live out their days .
9:2:033:0	The few not cut off from serving at my altar will survive , but only so their eyes can go blind and their hearts break , and their children will die a violent death .
9:2:034:0	And to prove that what I have said will come true , I will cause your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , to die on the same day !
9:2:035:0	“ Then I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire . I will establish his family , and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever .
9:2:036:0	Then all of your surviving family will bow before him , begging for money and food . ‘ Please , ' they will say , ‘ give us jobs among the priests so we will have enough to eat . ' ”
