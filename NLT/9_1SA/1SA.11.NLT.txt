9:11:001:1	Saul Defeats the Ammonites
9:11:001:0	About a month later , King Nahash of Ammon led his army against the Israelite town of Jabesh-gilead . But all the citizens of Jabesh asked for peace . “ Make a treaty with us , and we will be your servants , ” they pleaded .
9:11:002:0	“ All right , ” Nahash said , “ but only on one condition . I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you as a disgrace to all Israel ! ”
9:11:003:0	“ Give us seven days to send messengers throughout Israel ! ” replied the elders of Jabesh . “ If no one comes to save us , we will agree to your terms . ”
9:11:004:0	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the people about their plight , everyone broke into tears .
9:11:005:0	Saul had been plowing a field with his oxen , and when he returned to town , he asked , “ What 's the matter ? Why is everyone crying ? ” So they told him about the message from Jabesh .
9:11:006:0	Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul , and he became very angry .
9:11:007:0	He took two oxen and cut them into pieces and sent the messengers to carry them throughout Israel with this message : “ This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who refuses to follow Saul and Samuel into battle ! ” And the Lord made the people afraid of Saul 's anger , and all of them came out together as one .
9:11:008:0	When Saul mobilized them at Bezek , he found that there were 300,000 men from Israel and 30,000 men from Judah .
9:11:009:0	So Saul sent the messengers back to Jabesh-gilead to say , “ We will rescue you by noontime tomorrow ! ” There was great joy throughout the town when that message arrived !
9:11:010:0	The men of Jabesh then told their enemies , “ Tomorrow we will come out to you , and you can do to us whatever you wish . ”
9:11:011:0	But before dawn the next morning , Saul arrived , having divided his army into three detachments . He launched a surprise attack against the Ammonites and slaughtered them the whole morning . The remnant of their army was so badly scattered that no two of them were left together .
9:11:012:0	Then the people exclaimed to Samuel , “ Now where are those men who said , ‘ Why should Saul rule over us ? ' Bring them here , and we will kill them ! ”
9:11:013:0	But Saul replied , “ No one will be executed today , for today the Lord has rescued Israel ! ”
9:11:014:0	Then Samuel said to the people , “ Come , let us all go to Gilgal to renew the kingdom . ”
9:11:015:0	So they all went to Gilgal , and in a solemn ceremony before the Lord they made Saul king . Then they offered peace offerings to the Lord , and Saul and all the Israelites were filled with joy .
