9:18:001:1	Saul Becomes Jealous of David
9:18:001:0	After David had finished talking with Saul , he met Jonathan , the king 's son . There was an immediate bond between them , for Jonathan loved David .
9:18:002:0	From that day on Saul kept David with him and would n't let him return home .
9:18:003:0	And Jonathan made a solemn pact with David , because he loved him as he loved himself .
9:18:004:0	Jonathan sealed the pact by taking off his robe and giving it to David , together with his tunic , sword , bow , and belt .
9:18:005:0	Whatever Saul asked David to do , David did it successfully . So Saul made him a commander over the men of war , an appointment that was welcomed by the people and Saul 's officers alike .
9:18:006:0	When the victorious Israelite army was returning home after David had killed the Philistine , women from all the towns of Israel came out to meet King Saul . They sang and danced for joy with tambourines and cymbals .
9:18:007:0	This was their song : “ Saul has killed his thousands , and David his ten thousands ! ”
9:18:008:0	This made Saul very angry . “ What 's this ? ” he said . “ They credit David with ten thousands and me with only thousands . Next they 'll be making him their king ! ”
9:18:009:0	So from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David .
9:18:010:0	The very next day a tormenting spirit from God overwhelmed Saul , and he began to rave in his house like a madman . David was playing the harp , as he did each day . But Saul had a spear in his hand ,
9:18:011:0	and he suddenly hurled it at David , intending to pin him to the wall . But David escaped him twice .
9:18:012:0	Saul was then afraid of David , for the Lord was with David and had turned away from Saul .
9:18:013:0	Finally , Saul sent him away and appointed him commander over 1,000 men , and David faithfully led his troops into battle .
9:18:014:0	David continued to succeed in everything he did , for the Lord was with him .
9:18:015:0	When Saul recognized this , he became even more afraid of him .
9:18:002:1	David Marries Saul 's Daughter
9:18:016:0	But all Israel and Judah loved David because he was so successful at leading his troops into battle .
9:18:017:0	One day Saul said to David , “ I am ready to give you my older daughter , Merab , as your wife . But first you must prove yourself to be a real warrior by fighting the Lord 's battles. ” For Saul thought , “ I 'll send him out against the Philistines and let them kill him rather than doing it myself . ”
9:18:018:0	“ Who am I , and what is my family in Israel that I should be the king 's son-in-law ? ” David exclaimed . “ My father 's family is nothing ! ”
9:18:019:0	So when the time came for Saul to give his daughter Merab in marriage to David , he gave her instead to Adriel , a man from Meholah .
9:18:020:0	In the meantime , Saul 's daughter Michal had fallen in love with David , and Saul was delighted when he heard about it .
9:18:021:0	“ Here 's another chance to see him killed by the Philistines ! ” Saul said to himself . But to David he said , “ Today you have a second chance to become my son-in-law ! ”
9:18:022:0	Then Saul told his men to say to David , “ The king really likes you , and so do we . Why do n't you accept the king 's offer and become his son-in-law ? ”
9:18:023:0	When Saul 's men said these things to David , he replied , “ How can a poor man from a humble family afford the bride price for the daughter of a king ? ”
9:18:024:0	When Saul 's men reported this back to the king ,
9:18:025:0	he told them , “ Tell David that all I want for the bride price is 100 Philistine foreskins ! Vengeance on my enemies is all I really want. ” But what Saul had in mind was that David would be killed in the fight .
9:18:026:0	David was delighted to accept the offer . Before the time limit expired ,
9:18:027:0	he and his men went out and killed 200 Philistines . Then David fulfilled the king 's requirement by presenting all their foreskins to him . So Saul gave his daughter Michal to David to be his wife .
9:18:028:0	When Saul realized that the Lord was with David and how much his daughter Michal loved him ,
9:18:029:0	Saul became even more afraid of him , and he remained David 's enemy for the rest of his life .
9:18:030:0	Every time the commanders of the Philistines attacked , David was more successful against them than all the rest of Saul 's officers . So David 's name became very famous .
