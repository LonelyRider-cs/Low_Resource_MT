9:1:001:1	Elkanah and His Family
9:1:001:0	There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah in the region of Zuph in the hill country of Ephraim . He was the son of Jeroham , son of Elihu , son of Tohu , son of Zuph , of Ephraim .
9:1:002:0	Elkanah had two wives , Hannah and Peninnah . Peninnah had children , but Hannah did not .
9:1:003:0	Each year Elkanah would travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of Heaven 's Armies at the Tabernacle . The priests of the Lord at that time were the two sons of Eli — Hophni and Phinehas .
9:1:004:0	On the days Elkanah presented his sacrifice , he would give portions of the meat to Peninnah and each of her children .
9:1:005:0	And though he loved Hannah , he would give her only one choice portion because the Lord had given her no children .
9:1:006:0	So Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her because the Lord had kept her from having children .
9:1:007:0	Year after year it was the same — Peninnah would taunt Hannah as they went to the Tabernacle . Each time , Hannah would be reduced to tears and would not even eat .
9:1:002:1	Hannah 's Prayer for a Son
9:1:008:0	“ Why are you crying , Hannah ? ” Elkanah would ask . “ Why are n't you eating ? Why be downhearted just because you have no children ? You have me — is n't that better than having ten sons ? ”
9:1:009:0	Once after a sacrificial meal at Shiloh , Hannah got up and went to pray . Eli the priest was sitting at his customary place beside the entrance of the Tabernacle .
9:1:010:0	Hannah was in deep anguish , crying bitterly as she prayed to the Lord .
9:1:011:0	And she made this vow : “ O Lord of Heaven 's Armies , if you will look upon my sorrow and answer my prayer and give me a son , then I will give him back to you . He will be yours for his entire lifetime , and as a sign that he has been dedicated to the Lord , his hair will never be cut . ”
9:1:012:0	As she was praying to the Lord , Eli watched her .
9:1:013:0	Seeing her lips moving but hearing no sound , he thought she had been drinking .
9:1:014:0	“ Must you come here drunk ? ” he demanded . “ Throw away your wine ! ”
9:1:015:0	“ Oh no , sir ! ” she replied . “ I have n't been drinking wine or anything stronger . But I am very discouraged , and I was pouring out my heart to the Lord .
9:1:016:0	Do n't think I am a wicked woman ! For I have been praying out of great anguish and sorrow . ”
9:1:017:0	“ In that case , ” Eli said , “ go in peace ! May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him . ”
9:1:003:1	Samuel 's Birth and Dedication
9:1:018:0	“ Oh , thank you , sir ! ” she exclaimed . Then she went back and began to eat again , and she was no longer sad .
9:1:019:0	The entire family got up early the next morning and went to worship the Lord once more . Then they returned home to Ramah . When Elkanah slept with Hannah , the Lord remembered her plea ,
9:1:020:0	and in due time she gave birth to a son . She named him Samuel , for she said , “ I asked the Lord for him . ”
9:1:021:0	The next year Elkanah and his family went on their annual trip to offer a sacrifice to the Lord and to keep his vow .
9:1:022:0	But Hannah did not go . She told her husband , “ Wait until the boy is weaned . Then I will take him to the Tabernacle and leave him there with the Lord permanently . ”
9:1:023:0	“ Whatever you think is best , ” Elkanah agreed . “ Stay here for now , and may the Lord help you keep your promise. ” So she stayed home and nursed the boy until he was weaned .
9:1:024:0	When the child was weaned , Hannah took him to the Tabernacle in Shiloh . They brought along a three-year-old bull for the sacrifice and a basket of flour and some wine .
9:1:025:0	After sacrificing the bull , they brought the boy to Eli .
9:1:026:0	“ Sir , do you remember me ? ” Hannah asked . “ I am the very woman who stood here several years ago praying to the Lord .
9:1:027:0	I asked the Lord to give me this boy , and he has granted my request .
9:1:028:0	Now I am giving him to the Lord , and he will belong to the Lord his whole life. ” And they worshiped the Lord there .
