9:13:001:1	Continued War with Philistia
9:13:001:0	Saul was thirty years old when he became king , and he reigned for forty-two years .
9:13:002:0	Saul selected 3,000 special troops from the army of Israel and sent the rest of the men home . He took 2,000 of the chosen men with him to Micmash and the hill country of Bethel . The other 1,000 went with Saul 's son Jonathan to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin .
9:13:003:0	Soon after this , Jonathan attacked and defeated the garrison of Philistines at Geba . The news spread quickly among the Philistines . So Saul blew the ram 's horn throughout the land , saying , “ Hebrews , hear this ! Rise up in revolt ! ”
9:13:004:0	All Israel heard the news that Saul had destroyed the Philistine garrison at Geba and that the Philistines now hated the Israelites more than ever . So the entire Israelite army was summoned to join Saul at Gilgal .
9:13:005:0	The Philistines mustered a mighty army of 3,000 chariots , 6,000 charioteers , and as many warriors as the grains of sand on the seashore ! They camped at Micmash east of Beth-aven .
9:13:006:0	The men of Israel saw what a tight spot they were in ; and because they were hard pressed by the enemy , they tried to hide in caves , thickets , rocks , holes , and cisterns .
9:13:002:1	Saul 's Disobedience and Samuel 's Rebuke
9:13:007:0	Some of them crossed the Jordan River and escaped into the land of Gad and Gilead.Meanwhile , Saul stayed at Gilgal , and his men were trembling with fear .
9:13:008:0	Saul waited there seven days for Samuel , as Samuel had instructed him earlier , but Samuel still did n't come . Saul realized that his troops were rapidly slipping away .
9:13:009:0	So he demanded , “ Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings ! ” And Saul sacrificed the burnt offering himself .
9:13:010:0	Just as Saul was finishing with the burnt offering , Samuel arrived . Saul went out to meet and welcome him ,
9:13:011:0	but Samuel said , “ What is this you have done ? ” Saul replied , “ I saw my men scattering from me , and you did n't arrive when you said you would , and the Philistines are at Micmash ready for battle .
9:13:012:0	So I said , ‘ The Philistines are ready to march against us at Gilgal , and I have n't even asked for the Lord 's help ! ' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering myself before you came . ”
9:13:013:0	“ How foolish ! ” Samuel exclaimed . “ You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you . Had you kept it , the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever .
9:13:003:1	Israel 's Military Disadvantage
9:13:014:0	But now your kingdom must end , for the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart . The Lord has already appointed him to be the leader of his people , because you have not kept the Lord 's command . ”
9:13:015:0	Samuel then left Gilgal and went on his way , but the rest of the troops went with Saul to meet the army . They went up from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . When Saul counted the men who were still with him , he found only 600 were left !
9:13:016:0	Saul and Jonathan and the troops with them were staying at Geba in the land of Benjamin . The Philistines set up their camp at Micmash .
9:13:017:0	Three raiding parties soon left the camp of the Philistines . One went north toward Ophrah in the land of Shual ,
9:13:018:0	another went west to Beth-horon , and the third moved toward the border above the valley of Zeboim near the wilderness .
9:13:019:0	There were no blacksmiths in the land of Israel in those days . The Philistines would n't allow them for fear they would make swords and spears for the Hebrews .
9:13:020:0	So whenever the Israelites needed to sharpen their plowshares , picks , axes , or sickles , they had to take them to a Philistine blacksmith .
9:13:021:0	The charges were as follows : a quarter of an ounce of silver for sharpening a plowshare or a pick , and an eighth of an ounce for sharpening an ax or making the point of an ox goad .
9:13:022:0	So on the day of the battle none of the people of Israel had a sword or spear , except for Saul and Jonathan .
9:13:023:0	The pass at Micmash had meanwhile been secured by a contingent of the Philistine army .
