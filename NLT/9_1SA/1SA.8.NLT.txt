9:8:001:1	Israel Requests a King
9:8:001:0	As Samuel grew old , he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel .
9:8:002:0	Joel and Abijah , his oldest sons , held court in Beersheba .
9:8:003:0	But they were not like their father , for they were greedy for money . They accepted bribes and perverted justice .
9:8:004:0	Finally , all the elders of Israel met at Ramah to discuss the matter with Samuel .
9:8:005:0	“ Look , ” they told him , “ you are now old , and your sons are not like you . Give us a king to judge us like all the other nations have . ”
9:8:006:0	Samuel was displeased with their request and went to the Lord for guidance .
9:8:007:0	“ Do everything they say to you , ” the Lord replied , “ for they are rejecting me , not you . They do n't want me to be their king any longer .
9:8:008:0	Ever since I brought them from Egypt they have continually abandoned me and followed other gods . And now they are giving you the same treatment .
9:8:002:1	Samuel Warns against a Kingdom
9:8:009:0	Do as they ask , but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them . ”
9:8:010:0	So Samuel passed on the Lord 's warning to the people who were asking him for a king .
9:8:011:0	“ This is how a king will reign over you , ” Samuel said . “ The king will draft your sons and assign them to his chariots and his charioteers , making them run before his chariots .
9:8:012:0	Some will be generals and captains in his army , some will be forced to plow in his fields and harvest his crops , and some will make his weapons and chariot equipment .
9:8:013:0	The king will take your daughters from you and force them to cook and bake and make perfumes for him .
9:8:014:0	He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his own officials .
9:8:015:0	He will take a tenth of your grain and your grape harvest and distribute it among his officers and attendants .
9:8:016:0	He will take your male and female slaves and demand the finest of your cattle and donkeys for his own use .
9:8:017:0	He will demand a tenth of your flocks , and you will be his slaves .
9:8:018:0	When that day comes , you will beg for relief from this king you are demanding , but then the Lord will not help you . ”
9:8:019:0	But the people refused to listen to Samuel 's warning . “ Even so , we still want a king , ” they said .
9:8:020:0	“ We want to be like the nations around us . Our king will judge us and lead us into battle . ”
9:8:021:0	So Samuel repeated to the Lord what the people had said ,
9:8:022:0	and the Lord replied , “ Do as they say , and give them a king. ” Then Samuel agreed and sent the people home .
