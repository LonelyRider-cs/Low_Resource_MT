9:4:001:0	
9:4:002:0	The Philistines attacked and defeated the army of Israel , killing 4,000 men .
9:4:003:0	After the battle was over , the troops retreated to their camp , and the elders of Israel asked , “ Why did the Lord allow us to be defeated by the Philistines ? ” Then they said , “ Let 's bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from Shiloh . If we carry it into battle with us , it will save us from our enemies . ”
9:4:004:0	So they sent men to Shiloh to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , who is enthroned between the cherubim . Hophni and Phinehas , the sons of Eli , were also there with the Ark of the Covenant of God .
9:4:005:0	When all the Israelites saw the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord coming into the camp , their shout of joy was so loud it made the ground shake !
9:4:006:0	“ What 's going on ? ” the Philistines asked . “ What 's all the shouting about in the Hebrew camp ? ” When they were told it was because the Ark of the Lord had arrived ,
9:4:007:0	they panicked . “ The gods have come into their camp ! ” they cried . “ This is a disaster ! We have never had to face anything like this before !
9:4:008:0	Help ! Who can save us from these mighty gods of Israel ? They are the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians with plagues when Israel was in the wilderness .
9:4:009:0	Fight as never before , Philistines ! If you do n't , we will become the Hebrews ' slaves just as they have been ours ! Stand up like men and fight ! ”
9:4:010:0	So the Philistines fought desperately , and Israel was defeated again . The slaughter was great ; 30,000 Israelite soldiers died that day . The survivors turned and fled to their tents .
9:4:002:1	The Death of Eli
9:4:011:0	The Ark of God was captured , and Hophni and Phinehas , the two sons of Eli , were killed .
9:4:012:0	A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and arrived at Shiloh later that same day . He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show his grief .
9:4:013:0	Eli was waiting beside the road to hear the news of the battle , for his heart trembled for the safety of the Ark of God . When the messenger arrived and told what had happened , an outcry resounded throughout the town .
9:4:014:0	“ What is all the noise about ? ” Eli asked.The messenger rushed over to Eli ,
9:4:015:0	who was ninety-eight years old and blind .
9:4:016:0	He said to Eli , “ I have just come from the battlefield—I was there this very day. ” “ What happened , my son ? ” Eli demanded .
9:4:017:0	“ Israel has been defeated by the Philistines , ” the messenger replied . “ The people have been slaughtered , and your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , were also killed . And the Ark of God has been captured . ”
9:4:018:0	When the messenger mentioned what had happened to the Ark of God , Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate . He broke his neck and died , for he was old and overweight . He had been Israel 's judge for forty years .
9:4:019:0	Eli 's daughter-in-law , the wife of Phinehas , was pregnant and near her time of delivery . When she heard that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead , she went into labor and gave birth .
9:4:020:0	She died in childbirth , but before she passed away the midwives tried to encourage her . “ Do n't be afraid , ” they said . “ You have a baby boy ! ” But she did not answer or pay attention to them .
9:4:021:0	She named the child Ichabod ( which means “ Where is the glory ? ” ) , for she said , “ Israel 's glory is gone. ” She named him this because the Ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and husband were dead .
9:4:022:0	Then she said , “ The glory has departed from Israel , for the Ark of God has been captured . ”
