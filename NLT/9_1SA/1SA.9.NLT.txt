9:9:001:1	Saul Meets Samuel
9:9:001:0	There was a wealthy , influential man named Kish from the tribe of Benjamin . He was the son of Abiel , son of Zeror , son of Becorath , son of Aphiah , of the tribe of Benjamin .
9:9:002:0	His son Saul was the most handsome man in Israel — head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the land .
9:9:003:0	One day Kish 's donkeys strayed away , and he told Saul , “ Take a servant with you , and go look for the donkeys . ”
9:9:004:0	So Saul took one of the servants and traveled through the hill country of Ephraim , the land of Shalishah , the Shaalim area , and the entire land of Benjamin , but they could n't find the donkeys anywhere .
9:9:005:0	Finally , they entered the region of Zuph , and Saul said to his servant , “ Let 's go home . By now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys ! ”
9:9:006:0	But the servant said , “ I 've just thought of something ! There is a man of God who lives here in this town . He is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true . Let 's go find him . Perhaps he can tell us which way to go . ”
9:9:007:0	“ But we do n't have anything to offer him , ” Saul replied . “ Even our food is gone , and we do n't have a thing to give him . ”
9:9:008:0	“ Well , ” the servant said , “ I have one small silver piece . We can at least offer it to the man of God and see what happens ! ”
9:9:009:0	( In those days if people wanted a message from God , they would say , “ Let 's go and ask the seer , ” for prophets used to be called seers . )
9:9:010:0	“ All right , ” Saul agreed , “ let 's try it ! ” So they started into the town where the man of God lived .
9:9:011:0	As they were climbing the hill to the town , they met some young women coming out to draw water . So Saul and his servant asked , “ Is the seer here today ? ”
9:9:012:0	“ Yes , ” they replied . “ Stay right on this road . He is at the town gates . He has just arrived to take part in a public sacrifice up at the place of worship .
9:9:013:0	Hurry and catch him before he goes up there to eat . The guests wo n't begin eating until he arrives to bless the food . ”
9:9:014:0	So they entered the town , and as they passed through the gates , Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the place of worship .
9:9:015:0	Now the Lord had told Samuel the previous day ,
9:9:016:0	“ About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin . Anoint him to be the leader of my people , Israel . He will rescue them from the Philistines , for I have looked down on my people in mercy and have heard their cry . ”
9:9:017:0	When Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said , “ That 's the man I told you about ! He will rule my people . ”
9:9:018:0	Just then Saul approached Samuel at the gateway and asked , “ Can you please tell me where the seer 's house is ? ”
9:9:019:0	“ I am the seer ! ” Samuel replied . “ Go up to the place of worship ahead of me . We will eat there together , and in the morning I 'll tell you what you want to know and send you on your way .
9:9:020:0	And do n't worry about those donkeys that were lost three days ago , for they have been found . And I am here to tell you that you and your family are the focus of all Israel 's hopes . ”
9:9:021:0	Saul replied , “ But I 'm only from the tribe of Benjamin , the smallest tribe in Israel , and my family is the least important of all the families of that tribe ! Why are you talking like this to me ? ”
9:9:022:0	Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and placed them at the head of the table , honoring them above the thirty special guests .
9:9:023:0	Samuel then instructed the cook to bring Saul the finest cut of meat , the piece that had been set aside for the guest of honor .
9:9:024:0	So the cook brought in the meat and placed it before Saul . “ Go ahead and eat it , ” Samuel said . “ I was saving it for you even before I invited these others ! ” So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
9:9:025:0	When they came down from the place of worship and returned to town , Samuel took Saul up to the roof of the house and prepared a bed for him there .
9:9:026:0	At daybreak the next morning , Samuel called to Saul , “ Get up ! It 's time you were on your way. ” So Saul got ready , and he and Samuel left the house together .
9:9:027:0	When they reached the edge of town , Samuel told Saul to send his servant on ahead . After the servant was gone , Samuel said , “ Stay here , for I have received a special message for you from God . ”
