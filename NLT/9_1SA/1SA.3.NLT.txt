9:3:001:1	The
9:3:002:1	Lord
9:3:003:1	Speaks to Samuel
9:3:001:0	Meanwhile , the boy Samuel served the Lord by assisting Eli . Now in those days messages from the Lord were very rare , and visions were quite uncommon .
9:3:002:0	One night Eli , who was almost blind by now , had gone to bed .
9:3:003:0	The lamp of God had not yet gone out , and Samuel was sleeping in the Tabernacle near the Ark of God .
9:3:004:0	Suddenly the Lord called out , “ Samuel ! ” “ Yes ? ” Samuel replied . “ What is it ? ”
9:3:005:0	He got up and ran to Eli . “ Here I am . Did you call me ? ” “ I did n't call you , ” Eli replied . “ Go back to bed. ” So he did .
9:3:006:0	Then the Lord called out again , “ Samuel ! ” Again Samuel got up and went to Eli . “ Here I am . Did you call me ? ” “ I did n't call you , my son , ” Eli said . “ Go back to bed . ”
9:3:007:0	Samuel did not yet know the Lord because he had never had a message from the Lord before .
9:3:008:0	So the Lord called a third time , and once more Samuel got up and went to Eli . “ Here I am . Did you call me ? ” Then Eli realized it was the Lord who was calling the boy .
9:3:009:0	So he said to Samuel , “ Go and lie down again , and if someone calls again , say , ‘ Speak , Lord , your servant is listening . ' ” So Samuel went back to bed .
9:3:010:0	And the Lord came and called as before , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” And Samuel replied , “ Speak , your servant is listening . ”
9:3:011:0	Then the Lord said to Samuel , “ I am about to do a shocking thing in Israel .
9:3:012:0	I am going to carry out all my threats against Eli and his family , from beginning to end .
9:3:013:0	I have warned him that judgment is coming upon his family forever , because his sons are blaspheming God and he has n't disciplined them .
9:3:004:1	Samuel Speaks for the
9:3:005:1	Lord
9:3:014:0	So I have vowed that the sins of Eli and his sons will never be forgiven by sacrifices or offerings . ”
9:3:015:0	Samuel stayed in bed until morning , then got up and opened the doors of the Tabernacle as usual . He was afraid to tell Eli what the Lord had said to him .
9:3:016:0	But Eli called out to him , “ Samuel , my son. ” “ Here I am , ” Samuel replied .
9:3:017:0	“ What did the Lord say to you ? Tell me everything . And may God strike you and even kill you if you hide anything from me ! ”
9:3:018:0	So Samuel told Eli everything ; he did n't hold anything back . “ It is the Lord 's will , ” Eli replied . “ Let him do what he thinks best . ”
9:3:019:0	As Samuel grew up , the Lord was with him , and everything Samuel said proved to be reliable .
9:3:020:0	And all Israel , from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south , knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the Lord .
9:3:021:0	The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh and gave messages to Samuel there at the Tabernacle .
9:3:022:0	And Samuel 's words went out to all the people of Israel .
