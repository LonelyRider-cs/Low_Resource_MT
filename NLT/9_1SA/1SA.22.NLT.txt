9:22:001:1	David at the Cave of Adullam
9:22:001:0	So David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam . Soon his brothers and all his other relatives joined him there .
9:22:002:0	Then others began coming—men who were in trouble or in debt or who were just discontented—until David was the captain of about 400 men .
9:22:003:0	Later David went to Mizpeh in Moab , where he asked the king , “ Please allow my father and mother to live here with you until I know what God is going to do for me . ”
9:22:004:0	So David 's parents stayed in Moab with the king during the entire time David was living in his stronghold .
9:22:005:0	One day the prophet Gad told David , “ Leave the stronghold and return to the land of Judah. ” So David went to the forest of Hereth .
9:22:006:0	The news of his arrival in Judah soon reached Saul . At the time , the king was sitting beneath the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah , holding his spear and surrounded by his officers .
9:22:007:0	“ Listen here , you men of Benjamin ! ” Saul shouted to his officers when he heard the news . “ Has that son of Jesse promised every one of you fields and vineyards ? Has he promised to make you all generals and captains in his army ?
9:22:008:0	Is that why you have conspired against me ? For not one of you told me when my own son made a solemn pact with the son of Jesse . You 're not even sorry for me . Think of it ! My own son—encouraging him to kill me , as he is trying to do this very day ! ”
9:22:009:0	Then Doeg the Edomite , who was standing there with Saul 's men , spoke up . “ When I was at Nob , ” he said , “ I saw the son of Jesse talking to the priest , Ahimelech son of Ahitub .
9:22:002:1	The Slaughter of the Priests
9:22:010:0	Ahimelech consulted the Lord for him . Then he gave him food and the sword of Goliath the Philistine . ”
9:22:011:0	King Saul immediately sent for Ahimelech and all his family , who served as priests at Nob .
9:22:012:0	When they arrived , Saul shouted at him , “ Listen to me , you son of Ahitub ! ” “ What is it , my king ? ” Ahimelech asked .
9:22:013:0	“ Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me ? ” Saul demanded . “ Why did you give him food and a sword ? Why have you consulted God for him ? Why have you encouraged him to kill me , as he is trying to do this very day ? ”
9:22:014:0	“ But sir , ” Ahimelech replied , “ is anyone among all your servants as faithful as David , your son-in-law ? Why , he is the captain of your bodyguard and a highly honored member of your household !
9:22:015:0	This was certainly not the first time I had consulted God for him ! May the king not accuse me and my family in this matter , for I knew nothing at all of any plot against you . ”
9:22:016:0	“ You will surely die , Ahimelech , along with your entire family ! ” the king shouted .
9:22:017:0	And he ordered his bodyguards , “ Kill these priests of the Lord , for they are allies and conspirators with David ! They knew he was running away from me , but they did n't tell me ! ” But Saul 's men refused to kill the Lord 's priests .
9:22:018:0	Then the king said to Doeg , “ You do it. ” So Doeg the Edomite turned on them and killed them that day , eighty-five priests in all , still wearing their priestly garments .
9:22:019:0	Then he went to Nob , the town of the priests , and killed the priests ' families—men and women , children and babies—and all the cattle , donkeys , sheep , and goats .
9:22:020:0	Only Abiathar , one of the sons of Ahimelech , escaped and fled to David .
9:22:021:0	When he told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord ,
9:22:022:0	David exclaimed , “ I knew it ! When I saw Doeg the Edomite there that day , I knew he was sure to tell Saul . Now I have caused the death of all your father 's family .
9:22:023:0	Stay here with me , and do n't be afraid . I will protect you with my own life , for the same person wants to kill us both . ”
