9:28:001:1	Saul Consults a Medium
9:28:001:0	About that time the Philistines mustered their armies for another war with Israel . King Achish told David , “ You and your men will be expected to join me in battle . ”
9:28:002:0	“ Very well ! ” David agreed . “ Now you will see for yourself what we can do. ” Then Achish told David , “ I will make you my personal bodyguard for life . ”
9:28:003:0	Meanwhile , Samuel had died , and all Israel had mourned for him . He was buried in Ramah , his hometown . And Saul had banned from the land of Israel all mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead .
9:28:004:0	The Philistines set up their camp at Shunem , and Saul gathered all the army of Israel and camped at Gilboa .
9:28:005:0	When Saul saw the vast Philistine army , he became frantic with fear .
9:28:006:0	He asked the Lord what he should do , but the Lord refused to answer him , either by dreams or by sacred lots or by the prophets .
9:28:007:0	Saul then said to his advisers , “ Find a woman who is a medium , so I can go and ask her what to do. ” His advisers replied , “ There is a medium at Endor . ”
9:28:008:0	So Saul disguised himself by wearing ordinary clothing instead of his royal robes . Then he went to the woman 's home at night , accompanied by two of his men. “ I have to talk to a man who has died , ” he said . “ Will you call up his spirit for me ? ”
9:28:009:0	“ Are you trying to get me killed ? ” the woman demanded . “ You know that Saul has outlawed all the mediums and all who consult the spirits of the dead . Why are you setting a trap for me ? ”
9:28:010:0	But Saul took an oath in the name of the Lord and promised , “ As surely as the Lord lives , nothing bad will happen to you for doing this . ”
9:28:011:0	Finally , the woman said , “ Well , whose spirit do you want me to call up ? ” “ Call up Samuel , ” Saul replied .
9:28:012:0	When the woman saw Samuel , she screamed , “ You 've deceived me ! You are Saul ! ”
9:28:013:0	“ Do n't be afraid ! ” the king told her . “ What do you see ? ” “ I see a god coming up out of the earth , ” she said .
9:28:014:0	“ What does he look like ? ” Saul asked. “ He is an old man wrapped in a robe , ” she replied . Saul realized it was Samuel , and he fell to the ground before him .
9:28:015:0	“ Why have you disturbed me by calling me back ? ” Samuel asked Saul. “ Because I am in deep trouble , ” Saul replied . “ The Philistines are at war with me , and God has left me and wo n't reply by prophets or dreams . So I have called for you to tell me what to do . ”
9:28:016:0	But Samuel replied , “ Why ask me , since the Lord has left you and has become your enemy ?
9:28:017:0	The Lord has done just as he said he would . He has torn the kingdom from you and given it to your rival , David .
9:28:018:0	The Lord has done this to you today because you refused to carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites .
9:28:019:0	What 's more , the Lord will hand you and the army of Israel over to the Philistines tomorrow , and you and your sons will be here with me . The Lord will bring down the entire army of Israel in defeat . ”
9:28:020:0	Saul fell full length on the ground , paralyzed with fright because of Samuel 's words . He was also faint with hunger , for he had eaten nothing all day and all night .
9:28:021:0	When the woman saw how distraught he was , she said , “ Sir , I obeyed your command at the risk of my life .
9:28:022:0	Now do what I say , and let me give you a little something to eat so you can regain your strength for the trip back . ”
9:28:023:0	But Saul refused to eat anything . Then his advisers joined the woman in urging him to eat , so he finally yielded and got up from the ground and sat on the couch .
9:28:024:0	The woman had been fattening a calf , so she hurried out and killed it . She took some flour , kneaded it into dough and baked unleavened bread .
9:28:025:0	She brought the meal to Saul and his advisers , and they ate it . Then they went out into the night .
