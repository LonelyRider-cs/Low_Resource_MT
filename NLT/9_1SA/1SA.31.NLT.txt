9:31:001:1	The Death of Saul
9:31:001:0	Now the Philistines attacked Israel , and the men of Israel fled before them . Many were slaughtered on the slopes of Mount Gilboa .
9:31:002:0	The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons , and they killed three of his sons—Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malkishua .
9:31:003:0	The fighting grew very fierce around Saul , and the Philistine archers caught up with him and wounded him severely .
9:31:004:0	Saul groaned to his armor bearer , “ Take your sword and kill me before these pagan Philistines come to run me through and taunt and torture me. ” But his armor bearer was afraid and would not do it . So Saul took his own sword and fell on it .
9:31:005:0	When his armor bearer realized that Saul was dead , he fell on his own sword and died beside the king .
9:31:006:0	So Saul , his three sons , his armor bearer , and his troops all died together that same day .
9:31:007:0	When the Israelites on the other side of the Jezreel Valley and beyond the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead , they abandoned their towns and fled . So the Philistines moved in and occupied their towns .
9:31:008:0	The next day , when the Philistines went out to strip the dead , they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Mount Gilboa .
9:31:009:0	So they cut off Saul 's head and stripped off his armor . Then they proclaimed the good news of Saul 's death in their pagan temple and to the people throughout the land of Philistia .
9:31:010:0	They placed his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths , and they fastened his body to the wall of the city of Beth-shan .
9:31:011:0	But when the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul ,
9:31:012:0	all their mighty warriors traveled through the night to Beth-shan and took the bodies of Saul and his sons down from the wall . They brought them to Jabesh , where they burned the bodies .
9:31:013:0	Then they took their bones and buried them beneath the tamarisk tree at Jabesh , and they fasted for seven days .
