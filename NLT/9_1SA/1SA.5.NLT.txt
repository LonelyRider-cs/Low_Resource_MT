9:5:001:1	The Ark in Philistia
9:5:001:0	After the Philistines captured the Ark of God , they took it from the battleground at Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod .
9:5:002:0	They carried the Ark of God into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside an idol of Dagon .
9:5:003:0	But when the citizens of Ashdod went to see it the next morning , Dagon had fallen with his face to the ground in front of the Ark of the Lord ! So they took Dagon and put him in his place again .
9:5:004:0	But the next morning the same thing happened—Dagon had fallen face down before the Ark of the Lord again . This time his head and hands had broken off and were lying in the doorway . Only the trunk of his body was left intact .
9:5:005:0	That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod will step on its threshold .
9:5:006:0	Then the Lord 's heavy hand struck the people of Ashdod and the nearby villages with a plague of tumors .
9:5:007:0	When the people realized what was happening , they cried out , “ We ca n't keep the Ark of the God of Israel here any longer ! He is against us ! We will all be destroyed along with Dagon , our god . ”
9:5:008:0	So they called together the rulers of the Philistine towns and asked , “ What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel ? ” The rulers discussed it and replied , “ Move it to the town of Gath. ” So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath .
9:5:009:0	But when the Ark arrived at Gath , the Lord 's heavy hand fell on its men , young and old ; he struck them with a plague of tumors , and there was a great panic .
9:5:010:0	So they sent the Ark of God to the town of Ekron , but when the people of Ekron saw it coming they cried out , “ They are bringing the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us , too ! ”
9:5:011:0	The people summoned the Philistine rulers again and begged them , “ Please send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its own country , or it will kill us all. ” For the deadly plague from God had already begun , and great fear was sweeping across the town .
9:5:012:0	Those who did n't die were afflicted with tumors ; and the cry from the town rose to heaven .
