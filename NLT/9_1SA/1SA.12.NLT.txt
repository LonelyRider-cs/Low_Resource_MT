9:12:001:1	Samuel 's Farewell Address
9:12:001:0	Then Samuel addressed all Israel : “ I have done as you asked and given you a king .
9:12:002:0	Your king is now your leader . I stand here before you—an old , gray-haired man—and my sons serve you . I have served as your leader from the time I was a boy to this very day .
9:12:003:0	Now testify against me in the presence of the Lord and before his anointed one . Whose ox or donkey have I stolen ? Have I ever cheated any of you ? Have I ever oppressed you ? Have I ever taken a bribe and perverted justice ? Tell me and I will make right whatever I have done wrong . ”
9:12:004:0	“ No , ” they replied , “ you have never cheated or oppressed us , and you have never taken even a single bribe . ”
9:12:005:0	“ The Lord and his anointed one are my witnesses today , ” Samuel declared , “ that my hands are clean. ” “ Yes , he is a witness , ” they replied .
9:12:006:0	“ It was the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron , ” Samuel continued . “ He brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt .
9:12:007:0	Now stand here quietly before the Lord as I remind you of all the great things the Lord has done for you and your ancestors .
9:12:008:0	“ When the Israelites were in Egypt and cried out to the Lord , he sent Moses and Aaron to rescue them from Egypt and to bring them into this land .
9:12:009:0	But the people soon forgot about the Lord their God , so he handed them over to Sisera , the commander of Hazor 's army , and also to the Philistines and to the king of Moab , who fought against them .
9:12:010:0	“ Then they cried to the Lord again and confessed , ‘ We have sinned by turning away from the Lord and worshiping the images of Baal and Ashtoreth . But we will worship you and you alone if you will rescue us from our enemies . '
9:12:011:0	Then the Lord sent Gideon , Bedan , Jephthah , and Samuel to save you , and you lived in safety .
9:12:012:0	“ But when you were afraid of Nahash , the king of Ammon , you came to me and said that you wanted a king to reign over you , even though the Lord your God was already your king .
9:12:013:0	All right , here is the king you have chosen . You asked for him , and the Lord has granted your request .
9:12:014:0	“ Now if you fear and worship the Lord and listen to his voice , and if you do not rebel against the Lord 's commands , then both you and your king will show that you recognize the Lord as your God .
9:12:015:0	But if you rebel against the Lord 's commands and refuse to listen to him , then his hand will be as heavy upon you as it was upon your ancestors .
9:12:016:0	“ Now stand here and see the great thing the Lord is about to do .
9:12:017:0	You know that it does not rain at this time of the year during the wheat harvest . I will ask the Lord to send thunder and rain today . Then you will realize how wicked you have been in asking the Lord for a king ! ”
9:12:018:0	So Samuel called to the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day . And all the people were terrified of the Lord and of Samuel .
9:12:019:0	“ Pray to the Lord your God for us , or we will die ! ” they all said to Samuel . “ For now we have added to our sins by asking for a king . ”
9:12:020:0	“ Do n't be afraid , ” Samuel reassured them . “ You have certainly done wrong , but make sure now that you worship the Lord with all your heart , and do n't turn your back on him .
9:12:021:0	Do n't go back to worshiping worthless idols that can not help or rescue you—they are totally useless !
9:12:022:0	The Lord will not abandon his people , because that would dishonor his great name . For it has pleased the Lord to make you his very own people .
9:12:023:0	“ As for me , I will certainly not sin against the Lord by ending my prayers for you . And I will continue to teach you what is good and right .
9:12:024:0	But be sure to fear the Lord and faithfully serve him . Think of all the wonderful things he has done for you .
9:12:025:0	But if you continue to sin , you and your king will be swept away . ”
