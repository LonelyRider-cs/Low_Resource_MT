9:10:001:1	Samuel Anoints Saul as King
9:10:001:0	Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it over Saul 's head . He kissed Saul and said , “ I am doing this because the Lord has appointed you to be the ruler over Israel , his special possession .
9:10:002:0	When you leave me today , you will see two men beside Rachel 's tomb at Zelzah , on the border of Benjamin . They will tell you that the donkeys have been found and that your father has stopped worrying about them and is now worried about you . He is asking , ‘ Have you seen my son ? '
9:10:003:0	“ When you get to the oak of Tabor , you will see three men coming toward you who are on their way to worship God at Bethel . One will be bringing three young goats , another will have three loaves of bread , and the third will be carrying a wineskin full of wine .
9:10:004:0	They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves , which you are to accept .
9:10:005:0	“ When you arrive at Gibeah of God , where the garrison of the Philistines is located , you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the place of worship . They will be playing a harp , a tambourine , a flute , and a lyre , and they will be prophesying .
9:10:006:0	At that time the Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you , and you will prophesy with them . You will be changed into a different person .
9:10:007:0	After these signs take place , do what must be done , for God is with you .
9:10:002:1	Samuel 's Signs Are Fulfilled
9:10:008:0	Then go down to Gilgal ahead of me . I will join you there to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings . You must wait for seven days until I arrive and give you further instructions . ”
9:10:009:0	As Saul turned and started to leave , God gave him a new heart , and all Samuel 's signs were fulfilled that day .
9:10:010:0	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah , they saw a group of prophets coming toward them . Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul , and he , too , began to prophesy .
9:10:011:0	When those who knew Saul heard about it , they exclaimed , “ What ? Is even Saul a prophet ? How did the son of Kish become a prophet ? ”
9:10:012:0	And one of those standing there said , “ Can anyone become a prophet , no matter who his father is ? ” So that is the origin of the saying “ Is even Saul a prophet ? ”
9:10:013:0	When Saul had finished prophesying , he went up to the place of worship .
9:10:014:0	“ Where have you been ? ” Saul 's uncle asked him and his servant. “ We were looking for the donkeys , ” Saul replied , “ but we could n't find them . So we went to Samuel to ask him where they were . ”
9:10:015:0	“ Oh ? And what did he say ? ” his uncle asked .
9:10:003:1	Saul Is Acclaimed King
9:10:016:0	“ He told us that the donkeys had already been found , ” Saul replied . But Saul did n't tell his uncle what Samuel said about the kingdom .
9:10:017:0	Later Samuel called all the people of Israel to meet before the Lord at Mizpah .
9:10:018:0	And he said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , has declared : I brought you from Egypt and rescued you from the Egyptians and from all of the nations that were oppressing you .
9:10:019:0	But though I have rescued you from your misery and distress , you have rejected your God today and have said , ‘ No , we want a king instead ! ' Now , therefore , present yourselves before the Lord by tribes and clans . ”
9:10:020:0	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel before the Lord , and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot .
9:10:021:0	Then he brought each family of the tribe of Benjamin before the Lord , and the family of the Matrites was chosen . And finally Saul son of Kish was chosen from among them . But when they looked for him , he had disappeared !
9:10:022:0	So they asked the Lord , “ Where is he ? ” And the Lord replied , “ He is hiding among the baggage . ”
9:10:023:0	So they found him and brought him out , and he stood head and shoulders above anyone else .
9:10:024:0	Then Samuel said to all the people , “ This is the man the Lord has chosen as your king . No one in all Israel is like him ! ” And all the people shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”
9:10:025:0	Then Samuel told the people what the rights and duties of a king were . He wrote them down on a scroll and placed it before the Lord . Then Samuel sent the people home again .
9:10:026:0	When Saul returned to his home at Gibeah , a group of men whose hearts God had touched went with him .
9:10:027:0	But there were some scoundrels who complained , “ How can this man save us ? ” And they scorned him and refused to bring him gifts . But Saul ignored them . [ Nahash , king of the Ammonites , had been grievously oppressing the people of Gad and Reuben who lived east of the Jordan River . He gouged out the right eye of each of the Israelites living there , and he did n't allow anyone to come and rescue them . In fact , of all the Israelites east of the Jordan , there was n't a single one whose right eye Nahash had not gouged out . But there were 7,000 men who had escaped from the Ammonites , and they had settled in Jabesh-gilead . ]
