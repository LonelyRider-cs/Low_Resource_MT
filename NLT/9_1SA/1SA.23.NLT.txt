9:23:001:1	David Protects the Town of Keilah
9:23:001:0	One day news came to David that the Philistines were at Keilah stealing grain from the threshing floors .
9:23:002:0	David asked the Lord , “ Should I go and attack them ? ” “ Yes , go and save Keilah , ” the Lord told him .
9:23:003:0	But David 's men said , “ We 're afraid even here in Judah . We certainly do n't want to go to Keilah to fight the whole Philistine army ! ”
9:23:004:0	So David asked the Lord again , and again the Lord replied , “ Go down to Keilah , for I will help you conquer the Philistines . ”
9:23:005:0	So David and his men went to Keilah . They slaughtered the Philistines and took all their livestock and rescued the people of Keilah .
9:23:006:0	Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah , he brought the ephod with him .
9:23:007:0	Saul soon learned that David was at Keilah . “ Good ! ” he exclaimed . “ We 've got him now ! God has handed him over to me , for he has trapped himself in a walled town ! ”
9:23:008:0	So Saul mobilized his entire army to march to Keilah and besiege David and his men .
9:23:009:0	But David learned of Saul 's plan and told Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod and ask the Lord what he should do .
9:23:010:0	Then David prayed , “ O Lord , God of Israel , I have heard that Saul is planning to come and destroy Keilah because I am here .
9:23:011:0	Will the leaders of Keilah betray me to him ? And will Saul actually come as I have heard ? O Lord , God of Israel , please tell me. ” And the Lord said , “ He will come . ”
9:23:002:1	David Hides in the Wilderness
9:23:012:0	Again David asked , “ Will the leaders of Keilah betray me and my men to Saul ? ” And the Lord replied , “ Yes , they will betray you . ”
9:23:013:0	So David and his men — about 600 of them now — left Keilah and began roaming the countryside . Word soon reached Saul that David had escaped , so he did n't go to Keilah after all .
9:23:014:0	David now stayed in the strongholds of the wilderness and in the hill country of Ziph . Saul hunted him day after day , but God did n't let Saul find him .
9:23:015:0	One day near Horesh , David received the news that Saul was on the way to Ziph to search for him and kill him .
9:23:016:0	Jonathan went to find David and encouraged him to stay strong in his faith in God .
9:23:017:0	“ Do n't be afraid , ” Jonathan reassured him . “ My father will never find you ! You are going to be the king of Israel , and I will be next to you , as my father , Saul , is well aware . ”
9:23:018:0	So the two of them renewed their solemn pact before the Lord . Then Jonathan returned home , while David stayed at Horesh .
9:23:019:0	But now the men of Ziph went to Saul in Gibeah and betrayed David to him . “ We know where David is hiding , ” they said . “ He is in the strongholds of Horesh on the hill of Hakilah , which is in the southern part of Jeshimon .
9:23:020:0	Come down whenever you 're ready , O king , and we will catch him and hand him over to you ! ”
9:23:021:0	“ The Lord bless you , ” Saul said . “ At last someone is concerned about me !
9:23:022:0	Go and check again to be sure of where he is staying and who has seen him there , for I know that he is very crafty .
9:23:023:0	Discover his hiding places , and come back when you are sure . Then I 'll go with you . And if he is in the area at all , I 'll track him down , even if I have to search every hiding place in Judah ! ”
9:23:024:0	So the men of Ziph returned home ahead of Saul.Meanwhile , David and his men had moved into the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah Valley south of Jeshimon .
9:23:025:0	When David heard that Saul and his men were searching for him , he went even farther into the wilderness to the great rock , and he remained there in the wilderness of Maon . But Saul kept after him in the wilderness .
9:23:026:0	Saul and David were now on opposite sides of a mountain . Just as Saul and his men began to close in on David and his men ,
9:23:027:0	an urgent message reached Saul that the Philistines were raiding Israel again .
9:23:028:0	So Saul quit chasing David and returned to fight the Philistines . Ever since that time , the place where David was camped has been called the Rock of Escape .
9:23:029:0	David then went to live in the strongholds of En-gedi .
