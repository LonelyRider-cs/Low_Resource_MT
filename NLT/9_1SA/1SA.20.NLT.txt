9:20:001:1	Jonathan Helps David
9:20:001:0	David now fled from Naioth in Ramah and found Jonathan . “ What have I done ? ” he exclaimed . “ What is my crime ? How have I offended your father that he is so determined to kill me ? ”
9:20:002:0	“ That 's not true ! ” Jonathan protested . “ You 're not going to die . He always tells me everything he 's going to do , even the little things . I know my father would n't hide something like this from me . It just is n't so ! ”
9:20:003:0	Then David took an oath before Jonathan and said , “ Your father knows perfectly well about our friendship , so he has said to himself , ‘ I wo n't tell Jonathan—why should I hurt him ? ' But I swear to you that I am only a step away from death ! I swear it by the Lord and by your own soul ! ”
9:20:004:0	“ Tell me what I can do to help you , ” Jonathan exclaimed .
9:20:005:0	David replied , “ Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival . I 've always eaten with the king on this occasion , but tomorrow I 'll hide in the field and stay there until the evening of the third day .
9:20:006:0	If your father asks where I am , tell him I asked permission to go home to Bethlehem for an annual family sacrifice .
9:20:007:0	If he says , ‘ Fine ! ' you will know all is well . But if he is angry and loses his temper , you will know he is determined to kill me .
9:20:008:0	Show me this loyalty as my sworn friend—for we made a solemn pact before the Lord—or kill me yourself if I have sinned against your father . But please do n't betray me to him ! ”
9:20:009:0	“ Never ! ” Jonathan exclaimed . “ You know that if I had the slightest notion my father was planning to kill you , I would tell you at once . ”
9:20:010:0	Then David asked , “ How will I know whether or not your father is angry ? ”
9:20:011:0	“ Come out to the field with me , ” Jonathan replied . And they went out there together .
9:20:012:0	Then Jonathan told David , “ I promise by the Lord , the God of Israel , that by this time tomorrow , or the next day at the latest , I will talk to my father and let you know at once how he feels about you . If he speaks favorably about you , I will let you know .
9:20:013:0	But if he is angry and wants you killed , may the Lord strike me and even kill me if I do n't warn you so you can escape and live . May the Lord be with you as he used to be with my father .
9:20:014:0	And may you treat me with the faithful love of the Lord as long as I live . But if I die ,
9:20:015:0	treat my family with this faithful love , even when the Lord destroys all your enemies from the face of the earth . ”
9:20:016:0	So Jonathan made a solemn pact with David , saying , “ May the Lord destroy all your enemies ! ”
9:20:017:0	And Jonathan made David reaffirm his vow of friendship again , for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself .
9:20:018:0	Then Jonathan said , “ Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival . You will be missed when your place at the table is empty .
9:20:019:0	The day after tomorrow , toward evening , go to the place where you hid before , and wait there by the stone pile .
9:20:020:0	I will come out and shoot three arrows to the side of the stone pile as though I were shooting at a target .
9:20:021:0	Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back . If you hear me tell him , ‘ They 're on this side , ' then you will know , as surely as the Lord lives , that all is well , and there is no trouble .
9:20:022:0	But if I tell him , ‘ Go farther—the arrows are still ahead of you , ' then it will mean that you must leave immediately , for the Lord is sending you away .
9:20:023:0	And may the Lord make us keep our promises to each other , for he has witnessed them . ”
9:20:024:0	So David hid himself in the field , and when the new moon festival began , the king sat down to eat .
9:20:025:0	He sat at his usual place against the wall , with Jonathan sitting opposite him and Abner beside him . But David 's place was empty .
9:20:026:0	Saul did n't say anything about it that day , for he said to himself , “ Something must have made David ceremonially unclean . ”
9:20:027:0	But when David 's place was empty again the next day , Saul asked Jonathan , “ Why has n't the son of Jesse been here for the meal either yesterday or today ? ”
9:20:028:0	Jonathan replied , “ David earnestly asked me if he could go to Bethlehem .
9:20:029:0	He said , ‘ Please let me go , for we are having a family sacrifice . My brother demanded that I be there . So please let me get away to see my brothers . ' That 's why he is n't here at the king 's table . ”
9:20:030:0	Saul boiled with rage at Jonathan . “ You stupid son of a whore ! ” he swore at him . “ Do you think I do n't know that you want him to be king in your place , shaming yourself and your mother ?
9:20:031:0	As long as that son of Jesse is alive , you 'll never be king . Now go and get him so I can kill him ! ”
9:20:032:0	“ But why should he be put to death ? ” Jonathan asked his father . “ What has he done ? ”
9:20:033:0	Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan , intending to kill him . So at last Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David .
9:20:034:0	Jonathan left the table in fierce anger and refused to eat on that second day of the festival , for he was crushed by his father 's shameful behavior toward David .
9:20:035:0	The next morning , as agreed , Jonathan went out into the field and took a young boy with him to gather his arrows .
9:20:036:0	“ Start running , ” he told the boy , “ so you can find the arrows as I shoot them. ” So the boy ran , and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him .
9:20:037:0	When the boy had almost reached the arrow , Jonathan shouted , “ The arrow is still ahead of you .
9:20:038:0	Hurry , hurry , do n't wait. ” So the boy quickly gathered up the arrows and ran back to his master .
9:20:039:0	He , of course , suspected nothing ; only Jonathan and David understood the signal .
9:20:040:0	Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to take them back to town .
9:20:041:0	As soon as the boy was gone , David came out from where he had been hiding near the stone pile . Then David bowed three times to Jonathan with his face to the ground . Both of them were in tears as they embraced each other and said good-bye , especially David .
9:20:042:0	At last Jonathan said to David , “ Go in peace , for we have sworn loyalty to each other in the Lord 's name . The Lord is the witness of a bond between us and our children forever. ” Then David left , and Jonathan returned to the town .
