9:7:001:0	So the men of Kiriath-jearim came to get the Ark of the Lord . They took it to the hillside home of Abinadab and ordained Eleazar , his son , to be in charge of it .

9:7:002:0	The Ark remained in Kiriath-jearim for a long time—twenty years in all . During that time all Israel mourned because it seemed the Lord had abandoned them .
9:7:003:0	Then Samuel said to all the people of Israel , “ If you want to return to the Lord with all your hearts , get rid of your foreign gods and your images of Ashtoreth . Turn your hearts to the Lord and obey him alone ; then he will rescue you from the Philistines . ”
9:7:004:0	So the Israelites got rid of their images of Baal and Ashtoreth and worshiped only the Lord .
9:7:005:0	Then Samuel told them , “ Gather all of Israel to Mizpah , and I will pray to the Lord for you . ”
9:7:006:0	So they gathered at Mizpah and , in a great ceremony , drew water from a well and poured it out before the Lord . They also went without food all day and confessed that they had sinned against the Lord . ( It was at Mizpah that Samuel became Israel 's judge . )
9:7:007:0	When the Philistine rulers heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah , they mobilized their army and advanced . The Israelites were badly frightened when they learned that the Philistines were approaching .
9:7:008:0	“ Do n't stop pleading with the Lord our God to save us from the Philistines ! ” they begged Samuel .
9:7:009:0	So Samuel took a young lamb and offered it to the Lord as a whole burnt offering . He pleaded with the Lord to help Israel , and the Lord answered him .
9:7:010:0	Just as Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering , the Philistines arrived to attack Israel . But the Lord spoke with a mighty voice of thunder from heaven that day , and the Philistines were thrown into such confusion that the Israelites defeated them .
9:7:011:0	The men of Israel chased them from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car , slaughtering them all along the way .
9:7:012:0	Samuel then took a large stone and placed it between the towns of Mizpah and Jeshanah . He named it Ebenezer ( which means “ the stone of help ” ) , for he said , “ Up to this point the Lord has helped us ! ”
9:7:013:0	So the Philistines were subdued and did n't invade Israel again for some time . And throughout Samuel 's lifetime , the Lord 's powerful hand was raised against the Philistines .
9:7:014:0	The Israelite villages near Ekron and Gath that the Philistines had captured were restored to Israel , along with the rest of the territory that the Philistines had taken . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites in those days .
9:7:015:0	Samuel continued as Israel 's judge for the rest of his life .
9:7:016:0	Each year he traveled around , setting up his court first at Bethel , then at Gilgal , and then at Mizpah . He judged the people of Israel at each of these places .
9:7:017:0	Then he would return to his home at Ramah , and he would hear cases there , too . And Samuel built an altar to the Lord at Ramah .
