9:29:001:1	The Philistines Reject David
9:29:001:0	The entire Philistine army now mobilized at Aphek , and the Israelites camped at the spring in Jezreel .
9:29:002:0	As the Philistine rulers were leading out their troops in groups of hundreds and thousands , David and his men marched at the rear with King Achish .
9:29:003:0	But the Philistine commanders demanded , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” And Achish told them , “ This is David , the servant of King Saul of Israel . He 's been with me for years , and I 've never found a single fault in him from the day he arrived until today . ”
9:29:004:0	But the Philistine commanders were angry . “ Send him back to the town you 've given him ! ” they demanded . “ He ca n't go into the battle with us . What if he turns against us in battle and becomes our adversary ? Is there any better way for him to reconcile himself with his master than by handing our heads over to him ?
9:29:005:0	Is n't this the same David about whom the women of Israel sing in their dances , ‘ Saul has killed his thousands , and David his ten thousands ' ? ”
9:29:006:0	So Achish finally summoned David and said to him , “ I swear by the Lord that you have been a trustworthy ally . I think you should go with me into battle , for I 've never found a single flaw in you from the day you arrived until today . But the other Philistine rulers wo n't hear of it .
9:29:007:0	Please do n't upset them , but go back quietly . ”
9:29:008:0	“ What have I done to deserve this treatment ? ” David demanded . “ What have you ever found in your servant , that I ca n't go and fight the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
9:29:009:0	But Achish insisted , “ As far as I 'm concerned , you 're as perfect as an angel of God . But the Philistine commanders are afraid to have you with them in the battle .
9:29:010:0	Now get up early in the morning , and leave with your men as soon as it gets light . ”
9:29:011:0	So David and his men headed back into the land of the Philistines , while the Philistine army went on to Jezreel .
