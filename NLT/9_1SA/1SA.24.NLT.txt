9:24:001:1	David Spares Saul 's Life
9:24:001:0	After Saul returned from fighting the Philistines , he was told that David had gone into the wilderness of En-gedi .
9:24:002:0	So Saul chose 3,000 elite troops from all Israel and went to search for David and his men near the rocks of the wild goats .
9:24:003:0	At the place where the road passes some sheepfolds , Saul went into a cave to relieve himself . But as it happened , David and his men were hiding farther back in that very cave !
9:24:004:0	“ Now 's your opportunity ! ” David 's men whispered to him . “ Today the Lord is telling you , ‘ I will certainly put your enemy into your power , to do with as you wish . ' ” So David crept forward and cut off a piece of the hem of Saul 's robe .
9:24:005:0	But then David 's conscience began bothering him because he had cut Saul 's robe .
9:24:006:0	He said to his men , “ The Lord forbid that I should do this to my lord the king . I should n't attack the Lord 's anointed one , for the Lord himself has chosen him . ”
9:24:007:0	So David restrained his men and did not let them kill Saul.After Saul had left the cave and gone on his way ,
9:24:008:0	David came out and shouted after him , “ My lord the king ! ” And when Saul looked around , David bowed low before him .
9:24:009:0	Then he shouted to Saul , “ Why do you listen to the people who say I am trying to harm you ?
9:24:010:0	This very day you can see with your own eyes it is n't true . For the Lord placed you at my mercy back there in the cave . Some of my men told me to kill you , but I spared you . For I said , ‘ I will never harm the king—he is the Lord 's anointed one . '
9:24:011:0	Look , my father , at what I have in my hand . It is a piece of the hem of your robe ! I cut it off , but I did n't kill you . This proves that I am not trying to harm you and that I have not sinned against you , even though you have been hunting for me to kill me .
9:24:012:0	“ May the Lord judge between us . Perhaps the Lord will punish you for what you are trying to do to me , but I will never harm you .
9:24:013:0	As that old proverb says , ‘ From evil people come evil deeds . ' So you can be sure I will never harm you .
9:24:014:0	Who is the king of Israel trying to catch anyway ? Should he spend his time chasing one who is as worthless as a dead dog or a single flea ?
9:24:015:0	May the Lord therefore judge which of us is right and punish the guilty one . He is my advocate , and he will rescue me from your power ! ”
9:24:016:0	When David had finished speaking , Saul called back , “ Is that really you , my son David ? ” Then he began to cry .
9:24:017:0	And he said to David , “ You are a better man than I am , for you have repaid me good for evil .
9:24:018:0	Yes , you have been amazingly kind to me today , for when the Lord put me in a place where you could have killed me , you did n't do it .
9:24:019:0	Who else would let his enemy get away when he had him in his power ? May the Lord reward you well for the kindness you have shown me today .
9:24:020:0	And now I realize that you are surely going to be king , and that the kingdom of Israel will flourish under your rule .
9:24:021:0	Now swear to me by the Lord that when that happens you will not kill my family and destroy my line of descendants ! ”
9:24:022:0	So David promised this to Saul with an oath . Then Saul went home , but David and his men went back to their stronghold .
