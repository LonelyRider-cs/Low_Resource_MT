9:21:001:1	David Runs from Saul
9:21:001:0	David went to the town of Nob to see Ahimelech the priest . Ahimelech trembled when he saw him . “ Why are you alone ? ” he asked . “ Why is no one with you ? ”
9:21:002:0	“ The king has sent me on a private matter , ” David said . “ He told me not to tell anyone why I am here . I have told my men where to meet me later .
9:21:003:0	Now , what is there to eat ? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have . ”
9:21:004:0	“ We do n't have any regular bread , ” the priest replied . “ But there is the holy bread , which you can have if your young men have not slept with any women recently . ”
9:21:005:0	“ Do n't worry , ” David replied . “ I never allow my men to be with women when we are on a campaign . And since they stay clean even on ordinary trips , how much more on this one ! ”
9:21:006:0	Since there was no other food available , the priest gave him the holy bread—the Bread of the Presence that was placed before the Lord in the Tabernacle . It had just been replaced that day with fresh bread .
9:21:007:0	Now Doeg the Edomite , Saul 's chief herdsman , was there that day , having been detained before the Lord .
9:21:008:0	David asked Ahimelech , “ Do you have a spear or sword ? The king 's business was so urgent that I did n't even have time to grab a weapon ! ”
9:21:009:0	“ I only have the sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you killed in the valley of Elah , ” the priest replied . “ It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod . Take that if you want it , for there is nothing else here. ” “ There is nothing like it ! ” David replied . “ Give it to me ! ”
9:21:010:0	So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath .
9:21:011:0	But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there . “ Is n't this David , the king of the land ? ” they asked . “ Is n't he the one the people honor with dances , singing , ‘ Saul has killed his thousands , and David his ten thousands ' ? ”
9:21:012:0	David heard these comments and was very afraid of what King Achish of Gath might do to him .
9:21:013:0	So he pretended to be insane , scratching on doors and drooling down his beard .
9:21:014:0	Finally , King Achish said to his men , “ Must you bring me a madman ?
9:21:015:0	We already have enough of them around here ! Why should I let someone like this be my guest ? ”
