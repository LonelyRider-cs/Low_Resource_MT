9:17:001:1	Goliath Challenges the Israelites
9:17:001:0	The Philistines now mustered their army for battle and camped between Socoh in Judah and Azekah at Ephes-dammim .
9:17:002:0	Saul countered by gathering his Israelite troops near the valley of Elah .
9:17:003:0	So the Philistines and Israelites faced each other on opposite hills , with the valley between them .
9:17:004:0	Then Goliath , a Philistine champion from Gath , came out of the Philistine ranks to face the forces of Israel . He was over nine feet tall !
9:17:005:0	He wore a bronze helmet , and his bronze coat of mail weighed 125 pounds .
9:17:006:0	He also wore bronze leg armor , and he carried a bronze javelin on his shoulder .
9:17:007:0	The shaft of his spear was as heavy and thick as a weaver 's beam , tipped with an iron spearhead that weighed 15 pounds . His armor bearer walked ahead of him carrying a shield .
9:17:008:0	Goliath stood and shouted a taunt across to the Israelites . “ Why are you all coming out to fight ? ” he called . “ I am the Philistine champion , but you are only the servants of Saul . Choose one man to come down here and fight me !
9:17:009:0	If he kills me , then we will be your slaves . But if I kill him , you will be our slaves !
9:17:010:0	I defy the armies of Israel today ! Send me a man who will fight me ! ”
9:17:002:1	Jesse Sends David to Saul 's Camp
9:17:011:0	When Saul and the Israelites heard this , they were terrified and deeply shaken .
9:17:012:0	Now David was the son of a man named Jesse , an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in the land of Judah . Jesse was an old man at that time , and he had eight sons .
9:17:013:0	Jesse 's three oldest sons — Eliab , Abinadab , and Shimea — had already joined Saul 's army to fight the Philistines .
9:17:014:0	David was the youngest son . David 's three oldest brothers stayed with Saul 's army ,
9:17:015:0	but David went back and forth so he could help his father with the sheep in Bethlehem .
9:17:016:0	For forty days , every morning and evening , the Philistine champion strutted in front of the Israelite army .
9:17:017:0	One day Jesse said to David , “ Take this basket of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread , and carry them quickly to your brothers .
9:17:018:0	And give these ten cuts of cheese to their captain . See how your brothers are getting along , and bring back a report on how they are doing . ”
9:17:019:0	David 's brothers were with Saul and the Israelite army at the valley of Elah , fighting against the Philistines .
9:17:020:0	So David left the sheep with another shepherd and set out early the next morning with the gifts , as Jesse had directed him . He arrived at the camp just as the Israelite army was leaving for the battlefield with shouts and battle cries .
9:17:021:0	Soon the Israelite and Philistine forces stood facing each other , army against army .
9:17:022:0	David left his things with the keeper of supplies and hurried out to the ranks to greet his brothers .
9:17:023:0	As he was talking with them , Goliath , the Philistine champion from Gath , came out from the Philistine ranks . Then David heard him shout his usual taunt to the army of Israel .
9:17:024:0	As soon as the Israelite army saw him , they began to run away in fright .
9:17:025:0	“ Have you seen the giant ? ” the men asked . “ He comes out each day to defy Israel . The king has offered a huge reward to anyone who kills him . He will give that man one of his daughters for a wife , and the man 's entire family will be exempted from paying taxes ! ”
9:17:026:0	David asked the soldiers standing nearby , “ What will a man get for killing this Philistine and ending his defiance of Israel ? Who is this pagan Philistine anyway , that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God ? ”
9:17:027:0	And these men gave David the same reply . They said , “ Yes , that is the reward for killing him . ”
9:17:028:0	But when David 's oldest brother , Eliab , heard David talking to the men , he was angry . “ What are you doing around here anyway ? ” he demanded . “ What about those few sheep you 're supposed to be taking care of ? I know about your pride and deceit . You just want to see the battle ! ”
9:17:029:0	“ What have I done now ? ” David replied . “ I was only asking a question ! ”
9:17:030:0	He walked over to some others and asked them the same thing and received the same answer .
9:17:003:1	David Kills Goliath
9:17:031:0	Then David 's question was reported to King Saul , and the king sent for him .
9:17:032:0	“ Do n't worry about this Philistine , ” David told Saul . “ I 'll go fight him ! ”
9:17:033:0	“ Do n't be ridiculous ! ” Saul replied . “ There 's no way you can fight this Philistine and possibly win ! You 're only a boy , and he 's been a man of war since his youth . ”
9:17:034:0	But David persisted . “ I have been taking care of my father 's sheep and goats , ” he said . “ When a lion or a bear comes to steal a lamb from the flock ,
9:17:035:0	I go after it with a club and rescue the lamb from its mouth . If the animal turns on me , I catch it by the jaw and club it to death .
9:17:036:0	I have done this to both lions and bears , and I 'll do it to this pagan Philistine , too , for he has defied the armies of the living God !
9:17:037:0	The Lord who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine ! ” Saul finally consented . “ All right , go ahead , ” he said . “ And may the Lord be with you ! ”
9:17:038:0	Then Saul gave David his own armor — a bronze helmet and a coat of mail .
9:17:039:0	David put it on , strapped the sword over it , and took a step or two to see what it was like , for he had never worn such things before. “ I ca n't go in these , ” he protested to Saul . “ I 'm not used to them. ” So David took them off again .
9:17:040:0	He picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them into his shepherd 's bag . Then , armed only with his shepherd 's staff and sling , he started across the valley to fight the Philistine .
9:17:041:0	Goliath walked out toward David with his shield bearer ahead of him ,
9:17:042:0	sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy .
9:17:043:0	“ Am I a dog , ” he roared at David , “ that you come at me with a stick ? ” And he cursed David by the names of his gods .
9:17:044:0	“ Come over here , and I 'll give your flesh to the birds and wild animals ! ” Goliath yelled .
9:17:045:0	David replied to the Philistine , “ You come to me with sword , spear , and javelin , but I come to you in the name of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies — the God of the armies of Israel , whom you have defied .
9:17:046:0	Today the Lord will conquer you , and I will kill you and cut off your head . And then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds and wild animals , and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel !
9:17:047:0	And everyone assembled here will know that the Lord rescues his people , but not with sword and spear . This is the Lord 's battle , and he will give you to us ! ”
9:17:048:0	As Goliath moved closer to attack , David quickly ran out to meet him .
9:17:049:0	Reaching into his shepherd 's bag and taking out a stone , he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead . The stone sank in , and Goliath stumbled and fell face down on the ground .
9:17:050:0	So David triumphed over the Philistine with only a sling and a stone , for he had no sword .
9:17:004:1	Israel Routs the Philistines
9:17:051:0	Then David ran over and pulled Goliath 's sword from its sheath . David used it to kill him and cut off his head.When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they turned and ran .
9:17:052:0	Then the men of Israel and Judah gave a great shout of triumph and rushed after the Philistines , chasing them as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron . The bodies of the dead and wounded Philistines were strewn all along the road from Shaaraim , as far as Gath and Ekron .
9:17:053:0	Then the Israelite army returned and plundered the deserted Philistine camp .
9:17:054:0	( David took the Philistine 's head to Jerusalem , but he stored the man 's armor in his own tent . )
9:17:055:0	As Saul watched David go out to fight the Philistine , he asked Abner , the commander of his army , “ Abner , whose son is this young man ? ” “ I really do n't know , ” Abner declared .
9:17:056:0	“ Well , find out who he is ! ” the king told him .
9:17:057:0	As soon as David returned from killing Goliath , Abner brought him to Saul with the Philistine 's head still in his hand .
9:17:058:0	“ Tell me about your father , young man , ” Saul said.And David replied , “ His name is Jesse , and we live in Bethlehem . ”
