9:30:001:1	David Destroys the Amalekites
9:30:001:0	Three days later , when David and his men arrived home at their town of Ziklag , they found that the Amalekites had made a raid into the Negev and Ziklag ; they had crushed Ziklag and burned it to the ground .
9:30:002:0	They had carried off the women and children and everyone else but without killing anyone .
9:30:003:0	When David and his men saw the ruins and realized what had happened to their families ,
9:30:004:0	they wept until they could weep no more .
9:30:005:0	David 's two wives , Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail , the widow of Nabal from Carmel , were among those captured .
9:30:006:0	David was now in great danger because all his men were very bitter about losing their sons and daughters , and they began to talk of stoning him . But David found strength in the Lord his God .
9:30:007:0	Then he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring me the ephod ! ” So Abiathar brought it .
9:30:008:0	Then David asked the Lord , “ Should I chase after this band of raiders ? Will I catch them ? ” And the Lord told him , “ Yes , go after them . You will surely recover everything that was taken from you ! ”
9:30:009:0	So David and his 600 men set out , and they came to the brook Besor .
9:30:010:0	But 200 of the men were too exhausted to cross the brook , so David continued the pursuit with 400 men .
9:30:011:0	Along the way they found an Egyptian man in a field and brought him to David . They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink .
9:30:012:0	They also gave him part of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins , for he had n't had anything to eat or drink for three days and nights . Before long his strength returned .
9:30:013:0	“ To whom do you belong , and where do you come from ? ” David asked him. “ I am an Egyptian — the slave of an Amalekite , ” he replied . “ My master abandoned me three days ago because I was sick .
9:30:014:0	We were on our way back from raiding the Kerethites in the Negev , the territory of Judah , and the land of Caleb , and we had just burned Ziklag . ”
9:30:015:0	“ Will you lead me to this band of raiders ? ” David asked.The young man replied , “ If you take an oath in God 's name that you will not kill me or give me back to my master , then I will guide you to them . ”
9:30:016:0	So he led David to them , and they found the Amalekites spread out across the fields , eating and drinking and dancing with joy because of the vast amount of plunder they had taken from the Philistines and the land of Judah .
9:30:017:0	David and his men rushed in among them and slaughtered them throughout that night and the entire next day until evening . None of the Amalekites escaped except 400 young men who fled on camels .
9:30:018:0	David got back everything the Amalekites had taken , and he rescued his two wives .
9:30:019:0	Nothing was missing : small or great , son or daughter , nor anything else that had been taken . David brought everything back .
9:30:020:0	He also recovered all the flocks and herds , and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock . “ This plunder belongs to David ! ” they said .
9:30:021:0	Then David returned to the brook Besor and met up with the 200 men who had been left behind because they were too exhausted to go with him . They went out to meet David and his men , and David greeted them joyfully .
9:30:022:0	But some evil troublemakers among David 's men said , “ They did n't go with us , so they ca n't have any of the plunder we recovered . Give them their wives and children , and tell them to be gone . ”
9:30:023:0	But David said , “ No , my brothers ! Do n't be selfish with what the Lord has given us . He has kept us safe and helped us defeat the band of raiders that attacked us .
9:30:024:0	Who will listen when you talk like this ? We share and share alike — those who go to battle and those who guard the equipment . ”
9:30:025:0	From then on David made this a decree and regulation for Israel , and it is still followed today .
9:30:026:0	When he arrived at Ziklag , David sent part of the plunder to the elders of Judah , who were his friends . “ Here is a present for you , taken from the Lord 's enemies , ” he said .
9:30:027:0	The gifts were sent to the people of the following towns David had visited : Bethel , Ramoth-negev , Jattir ,
9:30:028:0	Aroer , Siphmoth , Eshtemoa ,
9:30:029:0	Racal , the towns of the Jerahmeelites , the towns of the Kenites ,
9:30:030:0	Hormah , Bor-ashan , Athach ,
9:30:031:0	Hebron , and all the other places David and his men had visited .
