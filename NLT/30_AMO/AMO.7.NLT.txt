30:7:001:1	A Vision of Locusts
30:7:001:0	The Sovereign Lord showed me a vision . I saw him preparing to send a vast swarm of locusts over the land . This was after the king 's share had been harvested from the fields and as the main crop was coming up .
30:7:002:0	In my vision the locusts ate every green plant in sight . Then I said , “ O Sovereign Lord , please forgive us or we will not survive , for Israel is so small . ”
30:7:002:1	A Vision of Fire
30:7:003:0	So the Lord relented from this plan . “ I will not do it , ” he said .
30:7:004:0	Then the Sovereign Lord showed me another vision . I saw him preparing to punish his people with a great fire . The fire had burned up the depths of the sea and was devouring the entire land .
30:7:005:0	Then I said , “ O Sovereign Lord , please stop or we will not survive , for Israel is so small . ”
30:7:003:1	A Vision of a Plumb Line
30:7:006:0	Then the Lord relented from this plan , too . “ I will not do that either , ” said the Sovereign Lord .
30:7:007:0	Then he showed me another vision . I saw the Lord standing beside a wall that had been built using a plumb line . He was using a plumb line to see if it was still straight .
30:7:008:0	And the Lord said to me , “ Amos , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ A plumb line. ” And the Lord replied , “ I will test my people with this plumb line . I will no longer ignore all their sins .
30:7:004:1	Amos and Amaziah
30:7:009:0	The pagan shrines of your ancestors will be ruined , and the temples of Israel will be destroyed ; I will bring the dynasty of King Jeroboam to a sudden end . ”
30:7:010:0	Then Amaziah , the priest of Bethel , sent a message to Jeroboam , king of Israel : “ Amos is hatching a plot against you right here on your very doorstep ! What he is saying is intolerable .
30:7:011:0	He is saying , ‘ Jeroboam will soon be killed , and the people of Israel will be sent away into exile . ' ”
30:7:012:0	Then Amaziah sent orders to Amos : “ Get out of here , you prophet ! Go on back to the land of Judah , and earn your living by prophesying there !
30:7:013:0	Do n't bother us with your prophecies here in Bethel . This is the king 's sanctuary and the national place of worship ! ”
30:7:014:0	But Amos replied , “ I 'm not a professional prophet , and I was never trained to be one . I 'm just a shepherd , and I take care of sycamore-fig trees .
30:7:015:0	But the Lord called me away from my flock and told me , ‘ Go and prophesy to my people in Israel . '
30:7:016:0	Now then , listen to this message from the Lord : “ You say , ‘ Do n't prophesy against Israel.Stop preaching against my people . '
30:7:017:0	But this is what the Lord says : ‘ Your wife will become a prostitute in this city , and your sons and daughters will be killed.Your land will be divided up , and you yourself will die in a foreign land.And the people of Israel will certainly become captives in exile , far from their homeland . ' ”
