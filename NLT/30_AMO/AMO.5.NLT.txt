30:5:001:1	A Call to Repentance
30:5:001:0	Listen , you people of Israel ! Listen to this funeral song I am singing :
30:5:002:0	“ The virgin Israel has fallen , never to rise again ! She lies abandoned on the ground , with no one to help her up . ”
30:5:003:0	The Sovereign Lord says : “ When a city sends a thousand men to battle , only a hundred will return.When a town sends a hundred , only ten will come back alive . ”
30:5:004:0	Now this is what the Lord says to the family of Israel : “ Come back to me and live !
30:5:005:0	Do n't worship at the pagan altars at Bethel ; do n't go to the shrines at Gilgal or Beersheba.For the people of Gilgal will be dragged off into exile , and the people of Bethel will be reduced to nothing . ”
30:5:006:0	Come back to the Lord and live ! Otherwise , he will roar through Israel like a fire , devouring you completely.Your gods in Bethelwo n't be able to quench the flames .
30:5:007:0	You twist justice , making it a bitter pill for the oppressed.You treat the righteous like dirt .
30:5:008:0	It is the Lord who created the stars , the Pleiades and Orion.He turns darkness into morningand day into night.He draws up water from the oceansand pours it down as rain on the land.The Lord is his name !
30:5:009:0	With blinding speed and power he destroys the strong , crushing all their defenses .
30:5:010:0	How you hate honest judges ! How you despise people who tell the truth !
30:5:011:0	You trample the poor , stealing their grain through taxes and unfair rent.Therefore , though you build beautiful stone houses , you will never live in them.Though you plant lush vineyards , you will never drink wine from them .
30:5:012:0	For I know the vast number of your sinsand the depth of your rebellions.You oppress good people by taking bribesand deprive the poor of justice in the courts .
30:5:013:0	So those who are smart keep their mouths shut , for it is an evil time .
30:5:014:0	Do what is good and run from evilso that you may live ! Then the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies will be your helper , just as you have claimed .
30:5:015:0	Hate evil and love what is good ; turn your courts into true halls of justice.Perhaps even yet the Lord God of Heaven 's Armieswill have mercy on the remnant of his people .
30:5:016:0	Therefore , this is what the Lord , the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , says : “ There will be crying in all the public squaresand mourning in every street.Call for the farmers to weep with you , and summon professional mourners to wail .
30:5:002:1	Warning of Coming Judgment
30:5:017:0	There will be wailing in every vineyard , for I will destroy them all , ” says the Lord .
30:5:018:0	What sorrow awaits you who say , “ If only the day of the Lord were here ! ” You have no idea what you are wishing for.That day will bring darkness , not light .
30:5:019:0	In that day you will be like a man who runs from a lion—only to meet a bear.Escaping from the bear , he leans his hand against a wall in his house—and he 's bitten by a snake .
30:5:020:0	Yes , the day of the Lord will be dark and hopeless , without a ray of joy or hope .
30:5:021:0	“ I hate all your show and pretense—the hypocrisy of your religious festivals and solemn assemblies .
30:5:022:0	I will not accept your burnt offerings and grain offerings.I wo n't even notice all your choice peace offerings .
30:5:023:0	Away with your noisy hymns of praise ! I will not listen to the music of your harps .
30:5:024:0	Instead , I want to see a mighty flood of justice , an endless river of righteous living .
30:5:025:0	“ Was it to me you were bringing sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness , Israel ?
30:5:026:0	No , you served your pagan gods—Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god—the images you made for yourselves .
30:5:027:0	So I will send you into exile , to a land east of Damascus , ” says the Lord , whose name is the God of Heaven 's Armies .
