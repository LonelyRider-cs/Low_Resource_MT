30:9:001:1	A Vision of God at the Altar
30:9:001:0	Then I saw a vision of the Lord standing beside the altar . He said , “ Strike the tops of the Temple columns , so that the foundation will shake.Bring down the roofon the heads of the people below.I will kill with the sword those who survive.No one will escape !
30:9:002:0	“ Even if they dig down to the place of the dead , I will reach down and pull them up.Even if they climb up into the heavens , I will bring them down .
30:9:003:0	Even if they hide at the very top of Mount Carmel , I will search them out and capture them.Even if they hide at the bottom of the ocean , I will send the sea serpent after them to bite them .
30:9:004:0	Even if their enemies drive them into exile , I will command the sword to kill them there.I am determined to bring disaster upon themand not to help them . ”
30:9:005:0	The Lord , the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , touches the land and it melts , and all its people mourn.The ground rises like the Nile River at floodtime , and then it sinks again .
30:9:006:0	The Lord 's home reaches up to the heavens , while its foundation is on the earth.He draws up water from the oceansand pours it down as rain on the land.The Lord is his name !
30:9:007:0	“ Are you Israelites more important to methan the Ethiopians ? ” asks the Lord. “ I brought Israel out of Egypt , but I also brought the Philistines from Creteand led the Arameans out of Kir .
30:9:008:0	“ I , the Sovereign Lord , am watching this sinful nation of Israel.I will destroy itfrom the face of the earth.But I will never completely destroy the family of Israel , ” says the Lord .
30:9:009:0	“ For I will give the commandand will shake Israel along with the other nationsas grain is shaken in a sieve , yet not one true kernel will be lost .
30:9:002:1	A Promise of Restoration
30:9:010:0	But all the sinners will die by the sword—all those who say , ‘ Nothing bad will happen to us . '
30:9:011:0	“ In that day I will restore the fallen house of David.I will repair its damaged walls.From the ruins I will rebuild itand restore its former glory .
30:9:012:0	And Israel will possess what is left of Edomand all the nations I have called to be mine. ” The Lord has spoken , and he will do these things .
30:9:013:0	“ The time will come , ” says the Lord , “ when the grain and grapes will grow fasterthan they can be harvested.Then the terraced vineyards on the hills of Israelwill drip with sweet wine !
30:9:014:0	I will bring my exiled people of Israelback from distant lands , and they will rebuild their ruined citiesand live in them again.They will plant vineyards and gardens ; they will eat their crops and drink their wine .
30:9:015:0	I will firmly plant them therein their own land.They will never again be uprootedfrom the land I have given them , ” says the Lord your God .
