30:6:001:0	What sorrow awaits you who lounge in luxury in Jerusalem , and you who feel secure in Samaria ! You are famous and popular in Israel , and people go to you for help .
30:6:002:0	But go over to Calnehand see what happened there.Then go to the great city of Hamathand down to the Philistine city of Gath.You are no better than they were , and look at how they were destroyed .
30:6:003:0	You push away every thought of coming disaster , but your actions only bring the day of judgment closer .
30:6:004:0	How terrible for you who sprawl on ivory bedsand lounge on your couches , eating the meat of tender lambs from the flockand of choice calves fattened in the stall .
30:6:005:0	You sing trivial songs to the sound of the harpand fancy yourselves to be great musicians like David .
30:6:006:0	You drink wine by the bowlfuland perfume yourselves with fragrant lotions.You care nothing about the ruin of your nation .
30:6:007:0	Therefore , you will be the first to be led away as captives.Suddenly , all your parties will end .
30:6:008:0	The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his own name , and this is what he , the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies , says : “ I despise the arrogance of Israel , and I hate their fortresses.I will give this cityand everything in it to their enemies . ”
30:6:009:0	( If there are ten men left in one house , they will all die .
30:6:010:0	And when a relative who is responsible to dispose of the dead goes into the house to carry out the bodies , he will ask the last survivor , “ Is anyone else with you ? ” When the person begins to swear , “ No , by . . . , ” he will interrupt and say , “ Stop ! Do n't even mention the name of the Lord . ” )
30:6:011:0	When the Lord gives the command , homes both great and small will be smashed to pieces .
30:6:012:0	Can horses gallop over boulders ? Can oxen be used to plow them ? But that 's how foolish you are when you turn justice into poisonand the sweet fruit of righteousness into bitterness .
30:6:013:0	And you brag about your conquest of Lo-debar.You boast , “ Did n't we take Karnaim by our own strength ? ”
30:6:014:0	“ O people of Israel , I am about to bring an enemy nation against you , ” says the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies. “ They will oppress you throughout your land—from Lebo-hamath in the northto the Arabah Valley in the south . ”
