30:4:001:1	Israel 's Failure to Learn
30:4:001:0	Listen to me , you fat cowsliving in Samaria , you women who oppress the poorand crush the needy , and who are always calling to your husbands , “ Bring us another drink ! ”
30:4:002:0	The Sovereign Lord has sworn this by his holiness : “ The time will come when you will be led awaywith hooks in your noses.Every last one of you will be dragged awaylike a fish on a hook !
30:4:003:0	You will be led out through the ruins of the wall ; you will be thrown from your fortresses , ” says the Lord .
30:4:004:0	“ Go ahead and offer sacrifices to the idols at Bethel.Keep on disobeying at Gilgal.Offer sacrifices each morning , and bring your tithes every three days .
30:4:005:0	Present your bread made with yeastas an offering of thanksgiving.Then give your extra voluntary offeringsso you can brag about it everywhere ! This is the kind of thing you Israelites love to do , ” says the Sovereign Lord .
30:4:006:0	“ I brought hunger to every cityand famine to every town.But still you would not return to me , ” says the Lord .
30:4:007:0	“ I kept the rain from fallingwhen your crops needed it the most.I sent rain on one townbut withheld it from another.Rain fell on one field , while another field withered away .
30:4:008:0	People staggered from town to town looking for water , but there was never enough.But still you would not return to me , ” says the Lord .
30:4:009:0	“ I struck your farms and vineyards with blight and mildew.Locusts devoured all your fig and olive trees.But still you would not return to me , ” says the Lord .
30:4:010:0	“ I sent plagues on youlike the plagues I sent on Egypt long ago.I killed your young men in warand led all your horses away.The stench of death filled the air ! But still you would not return to me , ” says the Lord .
30:4:011:0	“ I destroyed some of your cities , as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.Those of you who survivedwere like charred sticks pulled from a fire.But still you would not return to me , ” says the Lord .
30:4:012:0	“ Therefore , I will bring upon you all the disasters I have announced.Prepare to meet your God in judgment , you people of Israel ! ”
30:4:013:0	For the Lord is the one who shaped the mountains , stirs up the winds , and reveals his thoughts to mankind.He turns the light of dawn into darknessand treads on the heights of the earth.The Lord God of Heaven 's Armies is his name !
