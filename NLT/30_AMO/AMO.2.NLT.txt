30:2:001:0	This is what the Lord says : “ The people of Moab have sinned again and again , and I will not let them go unpunished ! They desecrated the bones of Edom 's king , burning them to ashes .
30:2:002:0	So I will send down fire on the land of Moab , and all the fortresses in Kerioth will be destroyed.The people will fall in the noise of battle , as the warriors shout and the ram 's horn sounds .
30:2:001:1	God 's Judgment on Judah and Israel
30:2:003:0	And I will destroy their kingand slaughter all their princes , ” says the Lord .
30:2:004:0	This is what the Lord says : “ The people of Judah have sinned again and again , and I will not let them go unpunished ! They have rejected the instruction of the Lord , refusing to obey his decrees.They have been led astray by the same liesthat deceived their ancestors .
30:2:005:0	So I will send down fire on Judah , and all the fortresses of Jerusalem will be destroyed . ”
30:2:006:0	This is what the Lord says : “ The people of Israel have sinned again and again , and I will not let them go unpunished ! They sell honorable people for silverand poor people for a pair of sandals .
30:2:007:0	They trample helpless people in the dustand shove the oppressed out of the way.Both father and son sleep with the same woman , corrupting my holy name .
30:2:008:0	At their religious festivals , they lounge in clothing their debtors put up as security.In the house of their gods , they drink wine bought with unjust fines .
30:2:009:0	“ But as my people watched , I destroyed the Amorites , though they were as tall as cedarsand as strong as oaks.I destroyed the fruit on their branchesand dug out their roots .
30:2:010:0	It was I who rescued you from Egyptand led you through the desert for forty years , so you could possess the land of the Amorites .
30:2:011:0	I chose some of your sons to be prophetsand others to be Nazirites.Can you deny this , my people of Israel ? ” asks the Lord .
30:2:012:0	“ But you caused the Nazirites to sin by making them drink wine , and you commanded the prophets , ‘ Shut up ! '
30:2:013:0	“ So I will make you groanlike a wagon loaded down with sheaves of grain .
30:2:014:0	Your fastest runners will not get away.The strongest among you will become weak.Even mighty warriors will be unable to save themselves .
30:2:015:0	The archers will not stand their ground.The swiftest runners wo n't be fast enough to escape.Even those riding horses wo n't be able to save themselves .
30:2:016:0	On that day the most courageous of your fighting menwill drop their weapons and run for their lives , ” says the Lord .
