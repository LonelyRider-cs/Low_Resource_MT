30:3:001:0	Listen to this message that the Lord has spoken against you , O people of Israel — against the entire family I rescued from Egypt :
30:3:001:1	Witnesses against Guilty Israel
30:3:002:0	“ From among all the families on the earth , I have been intimate with you alone.That is why I must punish youfor all your sins . ”
30:3:003:0	Can two people walk togetherwithout agreeing on the direction ?
30:3:004:0	Does a lion ever roar in a thicketwithout first finding a victim ? Does a young lion growl in its denwithout first catching its prey ?
30:3:005:0	Does a bird ever get caught in a trapthat has no bait ? Does a trap spring shutwhen there 's nothing to catch ?
30:3:006:0	When the ram 's horn blows a warning , should n't the people be alarmed ? Does disaster come to a cityunless the Lord has planned it ?
30:3:007:0	Indeed , the Sovereign Lord never does anythinguntil he reveals his plans to his servants the prophets .
30:3:008:0	The lion has roared — so who is n't frightened ? The Sovereign Lord has spoken — so who can refuse to proclaim his message ?
30:3:009:0	Announce this to the leaders of Philistiaand to the great ones of Egypt : “ Take your seats now on the hills around Samaria , and witness the chaos and oppression in Israel . ”
30:3:010:0	“ My people have forgotten how to do right , ” says the Lord. “ Their fortresses are filled with wealthtaken by theft and violence .
30:3:011:0	Therefore , ” says the Sovereign Lord , “ an enemy is coming ! He will surround them and shatter their defenses.Then he will plunder all their fortresses . ”
30:3:012:0	This is what the Lord says : “ A shepherd who tries to rescue a sheep from a lion 's mouthwill recover only two legs or a piece of an ear.So it will be for the Israelites in Samaria lying on luxurious beds , and for the people of Damascus reclining on couches .
30:3:013:0	“ Now listen to this , and announce it throughout all Israel , ” says the Lord , the Lord God of Heaven 's Armies .
30:3:014:0	“ On the very day I punish Israel for its sins , I will destroy the pagan altars at Bethel.The horns of the altar will be cut offand fall to the ground .
30:3:015:0	And I will destroy the beautiful homes of the wealthy — their winter mansions and their summer houses , too — all their palaces filled with ivory , ” says the Lord .
