65:1:001:1	Greetings from Jude
65:1:001:0	This letter is from Jude , a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.I am writing to all who have been called by God the Father , who loves you and keeps you safe in the care of Jesus Christ .
65:1:002:1	The Danger of False Teachers
65:1:002:0	May God give you more and more mercy , peace , and love .
65:1:003:0	Dear friends , I had been eagerly planning to write to you about the salvation we all share . But now I find that I must write about something else , urging you to defend the faith that God has entrusted once for all time to his holy people .
65:1:004:0	I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches , saying that God 's marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives . The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago , for they have denied our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65:1:005:0	So I want to remind you , though you already know these things , that Jesus first rescued the nation of Israel from Egypt , but later he destroyed those who did not remain faithful .
65:1:006:0	And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged . God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness , waiting for the great day of judgment .
65:1:007:0	And do n't forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns , which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion . Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God 's judgment .
65:1:008:0	In the same way , these people—who claim authority from their dreams—live immoral lives , defy authority , and scoff at supernatural beings .
65:1:009:0	But even Michael , one of the mightiest of the angels , did not dare accuse the devil of blasphemy , but simply said , “ The Lord rebuke you ! ” ( This took place when Michael was arguing with the devil about Moses ' body . )
65:1:010:0	But these people scoff at things they do not understand . Like unthinking animals , they do whatever their instincts tell them , and so they bring about their own destruction .
65:1:011:0	What sorrow awaits them ! For they follow in the footsteps of Cain , who killed his brother . Like Balaam , they deceive people for money . And like Korah , they perish in their rebellion .
65:1:012:0	When these people eat with you in your fellowship meals commemorating the Lord 's love , they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you . They are like shameless shepherds who care only for themselves . They are like clouds blowing over the land without giving any rain . They are like trees in autumn that are doubly dead , for they bear no fruit and have been pulled up by the roots .
65:1:013:0	They are like wild waves of the sea , churning up the foam of their shameful deeds . They are like wandering stars , doomed forever to blackest darkness .
65:1:014:0	Enoch , who lived in the seventh generation after Adam , prophesied about these people . He said , “ Listen ! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones
65:1:015:0	to execute judgment on the people of the world . He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him . ”
65:1:003:1	A Call to Remain Faithful
65:1:016:0	These people are grumblers and complainers , living only to satisfy their desires . They brag loudly about themselves , and they flatter others to get what they want .
65:1:017:0	But you , my dear friends , must remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ predicted .
65:1:018:0	They told you that in the last times there would be scoffers whose purpose in life is to satisfy their ungodly desires .
65:1:019:0	These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you . They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God 's Spirit in them .
65:1:020:0	But you , dear friends , must build each other up in your most holy faith , pray in the power of the Holy Spirit ,
65:1:021:0	and await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ , who will bring you eternal life . In this way , you will keep yourselves safe in God 's love .
65:1:022:0	And you must show mercy to those whose faith is wavering .
65:1:004:1	A Prayer of Praise
65:1:023:0	Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment . Show mercy to still others , but do so with great caution , hating the sins that contaminate their lives .
65:1:024:0	Now all glory to God , who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault .
65:1:025:0	All glory to him who alone is God , our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord . All glory , majesty , power , and authority are his before all time , and in the present , and beyond all time ! Amen .
