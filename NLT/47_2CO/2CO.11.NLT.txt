47:11:001:1	Paul and the False Apostles
47:11:001:0	I hope you will put up with a little more of my foolishness . Please bear with me .
47:11:002:0	For I am jealous for you with the jealousy of God himself . I promised you as a pure bride to one husband — Christ .
47:11:003:0	But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted , just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent .
47:11:004:0	You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you , even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach , or a different kind of Spirit than the one you received , or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed .
47:11:005:0	But I do n't consider myself inferior in any way to these “ super apostles ” who teach such things .
47:11:006:0	I may be unskilled as a speaker , but I 'm not lacking in knowledge . We have made this clear to you in every possible way .
47:11:007:0	Was I wrong when I humbled myself and honored you by preaching God 's Good News to you without expecting anything in return ?
47:11:008:0	I “ robbed ” other churches by accepting their contributions so I could serve you at no cost .
47:11:009:0	And when I was with you and did n't have enough to live on , I did not become a financial burden to anyone . For the brothers who came from Macedonia brought me all that I needed . I have never been a burden to you , and I never will be .
47:11:010:0	As surely as the truth of Christ is in me , no one in all of Greece will ever stop me from boasting about this .
47:11:011:0	Why ? Because I do n't love you ? God knows that I do .
47:11:012:0	But I will continue doing what I have always done . This will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours .
47:11:013:0	These people are false apostles . They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ .
47:11:014:0	But I am not surprised ! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
47:11:002:1	Paul 's Many Trials
47:11:015:0	So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve .
47:11:016:0	Again I say , do n't think that I am a fool to talk like this . But even if you do , listen to me , as you would to a foolish person , while I also boast a little .
47:11:017:0	Such boasting is not from the Lord , but I am acting like a fool .
47:11:018:0	And since others boast about their human achievements , I will , too .
47:11:019:0	After all , you think you are so wise , but you enjoy putting up with fools !
47:11:020:0	You put up with it when someone enslaves you , takes everything you have , takes advantage of you , takes control of everything , and slaps you in the face .
47:11:021:0	I 'm ashamed to say that we 've been too “ weak ” to do that ! But whatever they dare to boast about — I 'm talking like a fool again — I dare to boast about it , too .
47:11:022:0	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47:11:023:0	Are they servants of Christ ? I know I sound like a madman , but I have served him far more ! I have worked harder , been put in prison more often , been whipped times without number , and faced death again and again .
47:11:024:0	Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes .
47:11:025:0	Three times I was beaten with rods . Once I was stoned . Three times I was shipwrecked . Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea .
47:11:026:0	I have traveled on many long journeys . I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers . I have faced danger from my own people , the Jews , as well as from the Gentiles . I have faced danger in the cities , in the deserts , and on the seas . And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not .
47:11:027:0	I have worked hard and long , enduring many sleepless nights . I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food . I have shivered in the cold , without enough clothing to keep me warm .
47:11:028:0	Then , besides all this , I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches .
47:11:029:0	Who is weak without my feeling that weakness ? Who is led astray , and I do not burn with anger ?
47:11:030:0	If I must boast , I would rather boast about the things that show how weak I am .
47:11:031:0	God , the Father of our Lord Jesus , who is worthy of eternal praise , knows I am not lying .
47:11:032:0	When I was in Damascus , the governor under King Aretas kept guards at the city gates to catch me .
47:11:033:0	I had to be lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall to escape from him .
