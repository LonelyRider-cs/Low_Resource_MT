47:8:001:1	A Call to Generous Giving
47:8:001:0	Now I want you to know , dear brothers and sisters , what God in his kindness has done through the churches in Macedonia .
47:8:002:0	They are being tested by many troubles , and they are very poor . But they are also filled with abundant joy , which has overflowed in rich generosity .
47:8:003:0	For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford , but far more . And they did it of their own free will .
47:8:004:0	They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers in Jerusalem .
47:8:005:0	They even did more than we had hoped , for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us , just as God wanted them to do .
47:8:006:0	So we have urged Titus , who encouraged your giving in the first place , to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving .
47:8:007:0	Since you excel in so many ways—in your faith , your gifted speakers , your knowledge , your enthusiasm , and your love from us—I want you to excel also in this gracious act of giving .
47:8:008:0	I am not commanding you to do this . But I am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the other churches .
47:8:009:0	You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . Though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , so that by his poverty he could make you rich .
47:8:010:0	Here is my advice : It would be good for you to finish what you started a year ago . Last year you were the first who wanted to give , and you were the first to begin doing it .
47:8:011:0	Now you should finish what you started . Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now by your giving . Give in proportion to what you have .
47:8:012:0	Whatever you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly . And give according to what you have , not what you do n't have .
47:8:013:0	Of course , I do n't mean your giving should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves . I only mean that there should be some equality .
47:8:014:0	Right now you have plenty and can help those who are in need . Later , they will have plenty and can share with you when you need it . In this way , things will be equal .
47:8:002:1	Titus and His Companions
47:8:015:0	As the Scriptures say , “ Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over , and those who gathered only a little had enough . ”
47:8:016:0	But thank God ! He has given Titus the same enthusiasm for you that I have .
47:8:017:0	Titus welcomed our request that he visit you again . In fact , he himself was very eager to go and see you .
47:8:018:0	We are also sending another brother with Titus . All the churches praise him as a preacher of the Good News .
47:8:019:0	He was appointed by the churches to accompany us as we take the offering to Jerusalem—a service that glorifies the Lord and shows our eagerness to help .
47:8:020:0	We are traveling together to guard against any criticism for the way we are handling this generous gift .
47:8:021:0	We are careful to be honorable before the Lord , but we also want everyone else to see that we are honorable .
47:8:022:0	We are also sending with them another of our brothers who has proven himself many times and has shown on many occasions how eager he is . He is now even more enthusiastic because of his great confidence in you .
47:8:023:0	If anyone asks about Titus , say that he is my partner who works with me to help you . And the brothers with him have been sent by the churches , and they bring honor to Christ .
47:8:024:0	So show them your love , and prove to all the churches that our boasting about you is justified .
