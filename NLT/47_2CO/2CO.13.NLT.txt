47:13:001:1	Paul 's Final Advice
47:13:001:0	This is the third time I am coming to visit you ( and as the Scriptures say , “ The facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses ” ) .
47:13:002:0	I have already warned those who had been sinning when I was there on my second visit . Now I again warn them and all others , just as I did before , that next time I will not spare them .
47:13:003:0	I will give you all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me . Christ is not weak when he deals with you ; he is powerful among you .
47:13:004:0	Although he was crucified in weakness , he now lives by the power of God . We , too , are weak , just as Christ was , but when we deal with you we will be alive with him and will have God 's power .
47:13:005:0	Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine . Test yourselves . Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you ; if not , you have failed the test of genuine faith .
47:13:006:0	As you test yourselves , I hope you will recognize that we have not failed the test of apostolic authority .
47:13:007:0	We pray to God that you will not do what is wrong by refusing our correction . I hope we wo n't need to demonstrate our authority when we arrive . Do the right thing before we come — even if that makes it look like we have failed to demonstrate our authority .
47:13:008:0	For we can not oppose the truth , but must always stand for the truth .
47:13:009:0	We are glad to seem weak if it helps show that you are actually strong . We pray that you will become mature .
47:13:002:1	Paul 's Final Greetings
47:13:010:0	I am writing this to you before I come , hoping that I wo n't need to deal severely with you when I do come . For I want to use the authority the Lord has given me to strengthen you , not to tear you down .
47:13:011:0	Dear brothers and sisters , I close my letter with these last words : Be joyful . Grow to maturity . Encourage each other . Live in harmony and peace . Then the God of love and peace will be with you .
47:13:012:0	Greet each other with a sacred kiss .
47:13:013:0	All of God 's people here send you their greetings .
47:13:014:0	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
