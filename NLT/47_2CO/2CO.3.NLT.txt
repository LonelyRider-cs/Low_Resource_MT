47:3:001:0	Are we beginning to praise ourselves again ? Are we like others , who need to bring you letters of recommendation , or who ask you to write such letters on their behalf ? Surely not !
47:3:002:0	The only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves . Your lives are a letter written in our hearts ; everyone can read it and recognize our good work among you .
47:3:003:0	Clearly , you are a letter from Christ showing the result of our ministry among you . This “ letter ” is written not with pen and ink , but with the Spirit of the living God . It is carved not on tablets of stone , but on human hearts .
47:3:004:0	We are confident of all this because of our great trust in God through Christ .
47:3:005:0	It is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own . Our qualification comes from God .
47:3:001:1	The Glory of the New Covenant
47:3:006:0	He has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant . This is a covenant not of written laws , but of the Spirit . The old written covenant ends in death ; but under the new covenant , the Spirit gives life .
47:3:007:0	The old way , with laws etched in stone , led to death , though it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses ' face . For his face shone with the glory of God , even though the brightness was already fading away .
47:3:008:0	Should n't we expect far greater glory under the new way , now that the Holy Spirit is giving life ?
47:3:009:0	If the old way , which brings condemnation , was glorious , how much more glorious is the new way , which makes us right with God !
47:3:010:0	In fact , that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way .
47:3:011:0	So if the old way , which has been replaced , was glorious , how much more glorious is the new , which remains forever !
47:3:012:0	Since this new way gives us such confidence , we can be very bold .
47:3:013:0	We are not like Moses , who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel would not see the glory , even though it was destined to fade away .
47:3:014:0	But the people 's minds were hardened , and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read , the same veil covers their minds so they can not understand the truth . And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ .
47:3:015:0	Yes , even today when they read Moses ' writings , their hearts are covered with that veil , and they do not understand .
47:3:016:0	But whenever someone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47:3:017:0	For the Lord is the Spirit , and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
47:3:018:0	So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord . And the Lord — who is the Spirit — makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image .
