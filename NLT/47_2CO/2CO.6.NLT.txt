47:6:001:0	As God 's partners , we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God 's kindness and then ignore it .
47:6:001:1	Paul 's Hardships
47:6:002:0	For God says , “ At just the right time , I heard you.On the day of salvation , I helped you. ” Indeed , the “ right time ” is now . Today is the day of salvation .
47:6:003:0	We live in such a way that no one will stumble because of us , and no one will find fault with our ministry .
47:6:004:0	In everything we do , we show that we are true ministers of God . We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind .
47:6:005:0	We have been beaten , been put in prison , faced angry mobs , worked to exhaustion , endured sleepless nights , and gone without food .
47:6:006:0	We prove ourselves by our purity , our understanding , our patience , our kindness , by the Holy Spirit within us , and by our sincere love .
47:6:007:0	We faithfully preach the truth . God 's power is working in us . We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense .
47:6:008:0	We serve God whether people honor us or despise us , whether they slander us or praise us . We are honest , but they call us impostors .
47:6:009:0	We are ignored , even though we are well known . We live close to death , but we are still alive . We have been beaten , but we have not been killed .
47:6:010:0	Our hearts ache , but we always have joy . We are poor , but we give spiritual riches to others . We own nothing , and yet we have everything .
47:6:011:0	Oh , dear Corinthian friends ! We have spoken honestly with you , and our hearts are open to you .
47:6:012:0	There is no lack of love on our part , but you have withheld your love from us .
47:6:002:1	The Temple of the Living God
47:6:013:0	I am asking you to respond as if you were my own children . Open your hearts to us !
47:6:014:0	Do n't team up with those who are unbelievers . How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness ? How can light live with darkness ?
47:6:015:0	What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil ? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever ?
47:6:016:0	And what union can there be between God 's temple and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God . As God said : “ I will live in themand walk among them.I will be their God , and they will be my people .
47:6:017:0	Therefore , come out from among unbelievers , and separate yourselves from them , says the Lord.Do n't touch their filthy things , and I will welcome you .
47:6:018:0	And I will be your Father , and you will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty . ”
