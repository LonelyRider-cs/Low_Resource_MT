47:7:001:0	Because we have these promises , dear friends , let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit . And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God .
47:7:002:0	Please open your hearts to us . We have not done wrong to anyone , nor led anyone astray , nor taken advantage of anyone .
47:7:003:0	I 'm not saying this to condemn you . I said before that you are in our hearts , and we live or die together with you .
47:7:001:1	Paul 's Joy at the Church 's Repentance
47:7:004:0	I have the highest confidence in you , and I take great pride in you . You have greatly encouraged me and made me happy despite all our troubles .
47:7:005:0	When we arrived in Macedonia , there was no rest for us . We faced conflict from every direction , with battles on the outside and fear on the inside .
47:7:006:0	But God , who encourages those who are discouraged , encouraged us by the arrival of Titus .
47:7:007:0	His presence was a joy , but so was the news he brought of the encouragement he received from you . When he told us how much you long to see me , and how sorry you are for what happened , and how loyal you are to me , I was filled with joy !
47:7:008:0	I am not sorry that I sent that severe letter to you , though I was sorry at first , for I know it was painful to you for a little while .
47:7:009:0	Now I am glad I sent it , not because it hurt you , but because the pain caused you to repent and change your ways . It was the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have , so you were not harmed by us in any way .
47:7:010:0	For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation . There 's no regret for that kind of sorrow . But worldly sorrow , which lacks repentance , results in spiritual death .
47:7:011:0	Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you ! Such earnestness , such concern to clear yourselves , such indignation , such alarm , such longing to see me , such zeal , and such a readiness to punish wrong . You showed that you have done everything necessary to make things right .
47:7:012:0	My purpose , then , was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged . I wrote to you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how loyal you are to us .
47:7:013:0	We have been greatly encouraged by this.In addition to our own encouragement , we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was about the way all of you welcomed him and set his mind at ease .
47:7:014:0	I had told him how proud I was of you â€” and you did n't disappoint me . I have always told you the truth , and now my boasting to Titus has also proved true !
47:7:015:0	Now he cares for you more than ever when he remembers the way all of you obeyed him and welcomed him with such fear and deep respect .
47:7:016:0	I am very happy now because I have complete confidence in you .
