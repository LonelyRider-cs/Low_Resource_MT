47:9:001:1	The Collection for Christians in Jerusalem
47:9:001:0	I really do n't need to write to you about this ministry of giving for the believers in Jerusalem .
47:9:002:0	For I know how eager you are to help , and I have been boasting to the churches in Macedonia that you in Greece were ready to send an offering a year ago . In fact , it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving .
47:9:003:0	But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready , as I have been telling them , and that your money is all collected . I do n't want to be wrong in my boasting about you .
47:9:004:0	We would be embarrassed — not to mention your own embarrassment — if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you were n't ready after all I had told them !
47:9:005:0	So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready . But I want it to be a willing gift , not one given grudgingly .
47:9:006:0	Remember this — a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop . But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop .
47:9:007:0	You must each decide in your heart how much to give . And do n't give reluctantly or in response to pressure . “ For God loves a person who gives cheerfully . ”
47:9:008:0	And God will generously provide all you need . Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others .
47:9:009:0	As the Scriptures say , “ They share freely and give generously to the poor.Their good deeds will be remembered forever . ”
47:9:010:0	For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat . In the same way , he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you .
47:9:011:0	Yes , you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous . And when we take your gifts to those who need them , they will thank God .
47:9:012:0	So two good things will result from this ministry of giving — the needs of the believers in Jerusalem will be met , and they will joyfully express their thanks to God .
47:9:013:0	As a result of your ministry , they will give glory to God . For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ .
47:9:014:0	And they will pray for you with deep affection because of the overflowing grace God has given to you .
47:9:015:0	Thank God for this gift too wonderful for words !
