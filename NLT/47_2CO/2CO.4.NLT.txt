47:4:001:1	Treasure in Fragile Clay Jars
47:4:001:0	Therefore , since God in his mercy has given us this new way , we never give up .
47:4:002:0	We reject all shameful deeds and underhanded methods . We do n't try to trick anyone or distort the word of God . We tell the truth before God , and all who are honest know this .
47:4:003:0	If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil , it is hidden only from people who are perishing .
47:4:004:0	Satan , who is the god of this world , has blinded the minds of those who do n't believe . They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News . They do n't understand this message about the glory of Christ , who is the exact likeness of God .
47:4:005:0	You see , we do n't go around preaching about ourselves . We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord , and we ourselves are your servants for Jesus ' sake .
47:4:006:0	For God , who said , “ Let there be light in the darkness , ” has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ .
47:4:007:0	We now have this light shining in our hearts , but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure . This makes it clear that our great power is from God , not from ourselves .
47:4:008:0	We are pressed on every side by troubles , but we are not crushed . We are perplexed , but not driven to despair .
47:4:009:0	We are hunted down , but never abandoned by God . We get knocked down , but we are not destroyed .
47:4:010:0	Through suffering , our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies .
47:4:011:0	Yes , we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus , so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies .
47:4:012:0	So we live in the face of death , but this has resulted in eternal life for you .
47:4:013:0	But we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said , “ I believed in God , so I spoke . ”
47:4:014:0	We know that God , who raised the Lord Jesus , will also raise us with Jesus and present us to himself together with you .
47:4:015:0	All of this is for your benefit . And as God 's grace reaches more and more people , there will be great thanksgiving , and God will receive more and more glory .
47:4:016:0	That is why we never give up . Though our bodies are dying , our spirits are being renewed every day .
47:4:017:0	For our present troubles are small and wo n't last very long . Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever !
47:4:018:0	So we do n't look at the troubles we can see now ; rather , we fix our gaze on things that can not be seen . For the things we see now will soon be gone , but the things we can not see will last forever .
