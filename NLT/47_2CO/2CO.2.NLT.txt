47:2:001:0	So I decided that I would not bring you grief with another painful visit .
47:2:002:0	For if I cause you grief , who will make me glad ? Certainly not someone I have grieved .
47:2:003:0	That is why I wrote to you as I did , so that when I do come , I wo n't be grieved by the very ones who ought to give me the greatest joy . Surely you all know that my joy comes from your being joyful .
47:2:001:1	Forgiveness for the Sinner
47:2:004:0	I wrote that letter in great anguish , with a troubled heart and many tears . I did n't want to grieve you , but I wanted to let you know how much love I have for you .
47:2:005:0	I am not overstating it when I say that the man who caused all the trouble hurt all of you more than he hurt me .
47:2:006:0	Most of you opposed him , and that was punishment enough .
47:2:007:0	Now , however , it is time to forgive and comfort him . Otherwise he may be overcome by discouragement .
47:2:008:0	So I urge you now to reaffirm your love for him .
47:2:009:0	I wrote to you as I did to test you and see if you would fully comply with my instructions .
47:2:010:0	When you forgive this man , I forgive him , too . And when I forgive whatever needs to be forgiven , I do so with Christ 's authority for your benefit ,
47:2:011:0	so that Satan will not outsmart us . For we are familiar with his evil schemes .
47:2:012:0	When I came to the city of Troas to preach the Good News of Christ , the Lord opened a door of opportunity for me .
47:2:002:1	Ministers of the New Covenant
47:2:013:0	But I had no peace of mind because my dear brother Titus had n't yet arrived with a report from you . So I said good-bye and went on to Macedonia to find him .
47:2:014:0	But thank God ! He has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in Christ 's triumphal procession . Now he uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere , like a sweet perfume .
47:2:015:0	Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God . But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing .
47:2:016:0	To those who are perishing , we are a dreadful smell of death and doom . But to those who are being saved , we are a life-giving perfume . And who is adequate for such a task as this ?
47:2:017:0	You see , we are not like the many hucksters who preach for personal profit . We preach the word of God with sincerity and with Christ 's authority , knowing that God is watching us .
