47:12:001:1	Paul 's Vision and His Thorn in the Flesh
47:12:001:0	This boasting will do no good , but I must go on . I will reluctantly tell about visions and revelations from the Lord .
47:12:002:0	I was caught up to the third heaven fourteen years ago . Whether I was in my body or out of my body , I do n't know—only God knows .
47:12:003:0	Yes , only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body . But I do know
47:12:004:0	that I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they can not be expressed in words , things no human is allowed to tell .
47:12:005:0	That experience is worth boasting about , but I 'm not going to do it . I will boast only about my weaknesses .
47:12:006:0	If I wanted to boast , I would be no fool in doing so , because I would be telling the truth . But I wo n't do it , because I do n't want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message ,
47:12:007:0	even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God . So to keep me from becoming proud , I was given a thorn in my flesh , a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud .
47:12:008:0	Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away .
47:12:009:0	Each time he said , “ My grace is all you need . My power works best in weakness. ” So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ can work through me .
47:12:002:1	Paul 's Concern for the Corinthians
47:12:010:0	That 's why I take pleasure in my weaknesses , and in the insults , hardships , persecutions , and troubles that I suffer for Christ . For when I am weak , then I am strong .
47:12:011:0	You have made me act like a fool . You ought to be writing commendations for me , for I am not at all inferior to these “ super apostles , ” even though I am nothing at all .
47:12:012:0	When I was with you , I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle . For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you .
47:12:013:0	The only thing I failed to do , which I do in the other churches , was to become a financial burden to you . Please forgive me for this wrong !
47:12:014:0	Now I am coming to you for the third time , and I will not be a burden to you . I do n't want what you have—I want you . After all , children do n't provide for their parents . Rather , parents provide for their children .
47:12:015:0	I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you , even though it seems that the more I love you , the less you love me .
47:12:016:0	Some of you admit I was not a burden to you . But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery .
47:12:017:0	But how ? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you ?
47:12:018:0	When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him , did Titus take advantage of you ? No ! For we have the same spirit and walk in each other 's steps , doing things the same way .
47:12:019:0	Perhaps you think we 're saying these things just to defend ourselves . No , we tell you this as Christ 's servants , and with God as our witness . Everything we do , dear friends , is to strengthen you .
47:12:020:0	For I am afraid that when I come I wo n't like what I find , and you wo n't like my response . I am afraid that I will find quarreling , jealousy , anger , selfishness , slander , gossip , arrogance , and disorderly behavior .
47:12:021:0	Yes , I am afraid that when I come again , God will humble me in your presence . And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins . You have not repented of your impurity , sexual immorality , and eagerness for lustful pleasure .
