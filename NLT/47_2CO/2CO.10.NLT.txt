47:10:001:1	Paul Defends His Authority
47:10:001:0	Now I , Paul , appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ—though I realize you think I am timid in person and bold only when I write from far away .
47:10:002:0	Well , I am begging you now so that when I come I wo n't have to be bold with those who think we act from human motives .
47:10:003:0	We are human , but we do n't wage war as humans do .
47:10:004:0	We use God 's mighty weapons , not worldly weapons , to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments .
47:10:005:0	We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God . We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ .
47:10:006:0	And after you have become fully obedient , we will punish everyone who remains disobedient .
47:10:007:0	Look at the obvious facts . Those who say they belong to Christ must recognize that we belong to Christ as much as they do .
47:10:008:0	I may seem to be boasting too much about the authority given to us by the Lord . But our authority builds you up ; it does n't tear you down . So I will not be ashamed of using my authority .
47:10:009:0	I 'm not trying to frighten you by my letters .
47:10:010:0	For some say , “ Paul 's letters are demanding and forceful , but in person he is weak , and his speeches are worthless ! ”
47:10:011:0	Those people should realize that our actions when we arrive in person will be as forceful as what we say in our letters from far away .
47:10:012:0	Oh , do n't worry ; we would n't dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are ! But they are only comparing themselves with each other , using themselves as the standard of measurement . How ignorant !
47:10:013:0	We will not boast about things done outside our area of authority . We will boast only about what has happened within the boundaries of the work God has given us , which includes our working with you .
47:10:014:0	We are not reaching beyond these boundaries when we claim authority over you , as if we had never visited you . For we were the first to travel all the way to Corinth with the Good News of Christ .
47:10:015:0	Nor do we boast and claim credit for the work someone else has done . Instead , we hope that your faith will grow so that the boundaries of our work among you will be extended .
47:10:016:0	Then we will be able to go and preach the Good News in other places far beyond you , where no one else is working . Then there will be no question of our boasting about work done in someone else 's territory .
47:10:017:0	As the Scriptures say , “ If you want to boast , boast only about the Lord . ”
47:10:018:0	When people commend themselves , it does n't count for much . The important thing is for the Lord to commend them .
