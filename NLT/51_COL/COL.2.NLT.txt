51:2:001:0	I want you to know how much I have agonized for you and for the church at Laodicea , and for many other believers who have never met me personally .
51:2:002:0	I want them to be encouraged and knit together by strong ties of love . I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God 's mysterious plan , which is Christ himself .
51:2:003:0	In him lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51:2:004:0	I am telling you this so no one will deceive you with well-crafted arguments .
51:2:001:1	Freedom from Rules and New Life in Christ
51:2:005:0	For though I am far away from you , my heart is with you . And I rejoice that you are living as you should and that your faith in Christ is strong .
51:2:006:0	And now , just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord , you must continue to follow him .
51:2:007:0	Let your roots grow down into him , and let your lives be built on him . Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught , and you will overflow with thankfulness .
51:2:008:0	Do n't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers of this world , rather than from Christ .
51:2:009:0	For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body .
51:2:010:0	So you also are complete through your union with Christ , who is the head over every ruler and authority .
51:2:011:0	When you came to Christ , you were “ circumcised , ” but not by a physical procedure . Christ performed a spiritual circumcision — the cutting away of your sinful nature .
51:2:012:0	For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized . And with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of God , who raised Christ from the dead .
51:2:013:0	You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away . Then God made you alive with Christ , for he forgave all our sins .
51:2:014:0	He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross .
51:2:015:0	In this way , he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities . He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross .
51:2:016:0	So do n't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink , or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths .
51:2:017:0	For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come . And Christ himself is that reality .
51:2:018:0	Do n't let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels , saying they have had visions about these things . Their sinful minds have made them proud ,
51:2:019:0	and they are not connected to Christ , the head of the body . For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments , and it grows as God nourishes it .
51:2:020:0	You have died with Christ , and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world . So why do you keep on following the rules of the world , such as ,
51:2:021:0	“ Do n't handle ! Do n't taste ! Do n't touch ! ” ?
51:2:022:0	Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them .
51:2:023:0	These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion , pious self-denial , and severe bodily discipline . But they provide no help in conquering a person 's evil desires .
