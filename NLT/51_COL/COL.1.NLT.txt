51:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
51:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from our brother Timothy .
51:1:002:1	Paul 's Thanksgiving and Prayer
51:1:002:0	We are writing to God 's holy people in the city of Colosse , who are faithful brothers and sisters in Christ.May God our Father give you grace and peace .
51:1:003:0	We always pray for you , and we give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
51:1:004:0	For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all of God 's people ,
51:1:005:0	which come from your confident hope of what God has reserved for you in heaven . You have had this expectation ever since you first heard the truth of the Good News .
51:1:006:0	This same Good News that came to you is going out all over the world . It is bearing fruit everywhere by changing lives , just as it changed your lives from the day you first heard and understood the truth about God 's wonderful grace .
51:1:007:0	You learned about the Good News from Epaphras , our beloved co-worker . He is Christ 's faithful servant , and he is helping us on your behalf .
51:1:008:0	He has told us about the love for others that the Holy Spirit has given you .
51:1:009:0	So we have not stopped praying for you since we first heard about you . We ask God to give you complete knowledge of his will and to give you spiritual wisdom and understanding .
51:1:010:0	Then the way you live will always honor and please the Lord , and your lives will produce every kind of good fruit . All the while , you will grow as you learn to know God better and better .
51:1:011:0	We also pray that you will be strengthened with all his glorious power so you will have all the endurance and patience you need . May you be filled with joy ,
51:1:012:0	always thanking the Father . He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to his people , who live in the light .
51:1:013:0	For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son ,
51:1:003:1	Christ Is Supreme
51:1:014:0	who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins .
51:1:015:0	Christ is the visible image of the invisible God.He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation ,
51:1:016:0	for through him God created everythingin the heavenly realms and on earth.He made the things we can seeand the things we ca n't see â€” such as thrones , kingdoms , rulers , and authorities in the unseen world.Everything was created through him and for him .
51:1:017:0	He existed before anything else , and he holds all creation together .
51:1:018:0	Christ is also the head of the church , which is his body.He is the beginning , supreme over all who rise from the dead.So he is first in everything .
51:1:019:0	For God in all his fullnesswas pleased to live in Christ ,
51:1:020:0	and through him God reconciledeverything to himself.He made peace with everything in heaven and on earthby means of Christ 's blood on the cross .
51:1:021:0	This includes you who were once far away from God . You were his enemies , separated from him by your evil thoughts and actions .
51:1:022:0	Yet now he has reconciled you to himself through the death of Christ in his physical body . As a result , he has brought you into his own presence , and you are holy and blameless as you stand before him without a single fault .
51:1:004:1	Paul 's Work for the Church
51:1:023:0	But you must continue to believe this truth and stand firmly in it . Do n't drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the Good News . The Good News has been preached all over the world , and I , Paul , have been appointed as God 's servant to proclaim it .
51:1:024:0	I am glad when I suffer for you in my body , for I am participating in the sufferings of Christ that continue for his body , the church .
51:1:025:0	God has given me the responsibility of serving his church by proclaiming his entire message to you .
51:1:026:0	This message was kept secret for centuries and generations past , but now it has been revealed to God 's people .
51:1:027:0	For God wanted them to know that the riches and glory of Christ are for you Gentiles , too . And this is the secret : Christ lives in you . This gives you assurance of sharing his glory .
51:1:028:0	So we tell others about Christ , warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us . We want to present them to God , perfect in their relationship to Christ .
51:1:029:0	That 's why I work and struggle so hard , depending on Christ 's mighty power that works within me .
