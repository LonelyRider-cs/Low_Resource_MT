51:3:001:1	Living the New Life
51:3:001:0	Since you have been raised to new life with Christ , set your sights on the realities of heaven , where Christ sits in the place of honor at God 's right hand .
51:3:002:0	Think about the things of heaven , not the things of earth .
51:3:003:0	For you died to this life , and your real life is hidden with Christ in God .
51:3:004:0	And when Christ , who is your life , is revealed to the whole world , you will share in all his glory .
51:3:005:0	So put to death the sinful , earthly things lurking within you . Have nothing to do with sexual immorality , impurity , lust , and evil desires . Do n't be greedy , for a greedy person is an idolater , worshiping the things of this world .
51:3:006:0	Because of these sins , the anger of God is coming .
51:3:007:0	You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world .
51:3:008:0	But now is the time to get rid of anger , rage , malicious behavior , slander , and dirty language .
51:3:009:0	Do n't lie to each other , for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds .
51:3:010:0	Put on your new nature , and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him .
51:3:011:0	In this new life , it does n't matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile , circumcised or uncircumcised , barbaric , uncivilized , slave , or free . Christ is all that matters , and he lives in all of us .
51:3:012:0	Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves , you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience .
51:3:013:0	Make allowance for each other 's faults , and forgive anyone who offends you . Remember , the Lord forgave you , so you must forgive others .
51:3:014:0	Above all , clothe yourselves with love , which binds us all together in perfect harmony .
51:3:015:0	And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts . For as members of one body you are called to live in peace . And always be thankful .
51:3:016:0	Let the message about Christ , in all its richness , fill your lives . Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives . Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts .
51:3:002:1	Instructions for Christian Households
51:3:017:0	And whatever you do or say , do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks through him to God the Father .
51:3:018:0	Wives , submit to your husbands , as is fitting for those who belong to the Lord .
51:3:019:0	Husbands , love your wives and never treat them harshly .
51:3:020:0	Children , always obey your parents , for this pleases the Lord .
51:3:021:0	Fathers , do not aggravate your children , or they will become discouraged .
51:3:022:0	Slaves , obey your earthly masters in everything you do . Try to please them all the time , not just when they are watching you . Serve them sincerely because of your reverent fear of the Lord .
51:3:023:0	Work willingly at whatever you do , as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people .
51:3:024:0	Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward , and that the Master you are serving is Christ .
51:3:025:0	But if you do what is wrong , you will be paid back for the wrong you have done . For God has no favorites .
