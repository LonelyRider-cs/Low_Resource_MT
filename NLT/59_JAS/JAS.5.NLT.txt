59:5:001:1	Warning to the Rich
59:5:001:0	Look here , you rich people : Weep and groan with anguish because of all the terrible troubles ahead of you .
59:5:002:0	Your wealth is rotting away , and your fine clothes are moth-eaten rags .
59:5:003:0	Your gold and silver are corroded . The very wealth you were counting on will eat away your flesh like fire . This corroded treasure you have hoarded will testify against you on the day of judgment .
59:5:004:0	For listen ! Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay . The cries of those who harvest your fields have reached the ears of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
59:5:005:0	You have spent your years on earth in luxury , satisfying your every desire . You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter .
59:5:002:1	Patience and Endurance
59:5:006:0	You have condemned and killed innocent people , who do not resist you .
59:5:007:0	Dear brothers and sisters , be patient as you wait for the Lord 's return . Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall and in the spring . They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen .
59:5:008:0	You , too , must be patient . Take courage , for the coming of the Lord is near .
59:5:009:0	Do n't grumble about each other , brothers and sisters , or you will be judged . For lookâ€”the Judge is standing at the door !
59:5:010:0	For examples of patience in suffering , dear brothers and sisters , look at the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59:5:011:0	We give great honor to those who endure under suffering . For instance , you know about Job , a man of great endurance . You can see how the Lord was kind to him at the end , for the Lord is full of tenderness and mercy .
59:5:003:1	The Power of Prayer
59:5:012:0	But most of all , my brothers and sisters , never take an oath , by heaven or earth or anything else . Just say a simple yes or no , so that you will not sin and be condemned .
59:5:013:0	Are any of you suffering hardships ? You should pray . Are any of you happy ? You should sing praises .
59:5:014:0	Are any of you sick ? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you , anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord .
59:5:015:0	Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick , and the Lord will make you well . And if you have committed any sins , you will be forgiven .
59:5:016:0	Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed . The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results .
59:5:017:0	Elijah was as human as we are , and yet when he prayed earnestly that no rain would fall , none fell for three and a half years !
59:5:004:1	Restore Wandering Believers
59:5:018:0	Then , when he prayed again , the sky sent down rain and the earth began to yield its crops .
59:5:019:0	My dear brothers and sisters , if someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back ,
59:5:020:0	you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back from wandering will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins .
