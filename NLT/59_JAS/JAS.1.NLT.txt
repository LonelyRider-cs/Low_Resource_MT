59:1:001:1	Greetings from James
59:1:002:1	Faith and Endurance
59:1:001:0	This letter is from James , a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.I am writing to the “ twelve tribes ” — Jewish believers scattered abroad.Greetings !
59:1:002:0	Dear brothers and sisters , when troubles of any kind come your way , consider it an opportunity for great joy .
59:1:003:0	For you know that when your faith is tested , your endurance has a chance to grow .
59:1:004:0	So let it grow , for when your endurance is fully developed , you will be perfect and complete , needing nothing .
59:1:005:0	If you need wisdom , ask our generous God , and he will give it to you . He will not rebuke you for asking .
59:1:006:0	But when you ask him , be sure that your faith is in God alone . Do not waver , for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind .
59:1:007:0	Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord .
59:1:008:0	Their loyalty is divided between God and the world , and they are unstable in everything they do .
59:1:009:0	Believers who are poor have something to boast about , for God has honored them .
59:1:010:0	And those who are rich should boast that God has humbled them . They will fade away like a little flower in the field .
59:1:011:0	The hot sun rises and the grass withers ; the little flower droops and falls , and its beauty fades away . In the same way , the rich will fade away with all of their achievements .
59:1:012:0	God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation . Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him .
59:1:013:0	And remember , when you are being tempted , do not say , “ God is tempting me. ” God is never tempted to do wrong , and he never tempts anyone else .
59:1:014:0	Temptation comes from our own desires , which entice us and drag us away .
59:1:015:0	These desires give birth to sinful actions . And when sin is allowed to grow , it gives birth to death .
59:1:016:0	So do n't be misled , my dear brothers and sisters .
59:1:017:0	Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down to us from God our Father , who created all the lights in the heavens . He never changes or casts a shifting shadow .
59:1:003:1	Listening and Doing
59:1:018:0	He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word . And we , out of all creation , became his prized possession .
59:1:019:0	Understand this , my dear brothers and sisters : You must all be quick to listen , slow to speak , and slow to get angry .
59:1:020:0	Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires .
59:1:021:0	So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives , and humbly accept the word God has planted in your hearts , for it has the power to save your souls .
59:1:022:0	But do n't just listen to God 's word . You must do what it says . Otherwise , you are only fooling yourselves .
59:1:023:0	For if you listen to the word and do n't obey , it is like glancing at your face in a mirror .
59:1:024:0	You see yourself , walk away , and forget what you look like .
59:1:025:0	But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free , and if you do what it says and do n't forget what you heard , then God will bless you for doing it .
59:1:026:0	If you claim to be religious but do n't control your tongue , you are fooling yourself , and your religion is worthless .
59:1:027:0	Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you .
