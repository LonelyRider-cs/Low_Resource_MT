59:2:001:1	A Warning against Prejudice
59:2:001:0	My dear brothers and sisters , how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor some people over others ?
59:2:002:0	For example , suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry , and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty clothes .
59:2:003:0	If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person , but you say to the poor one , “ You can stand over there , or else sit on the floor ” — well ,
59:2:004:0	does n't this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives ?
59:2:005:0	Listen to me , dear brothers and sisters . Has n't God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith ? Are n't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him ?
59:2:006:0	But you dishonor the poor ! Is n't it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court ?
59:2:007:0	Are n't they the ones who slander Jesus Christ , whose noble name you bear ?
59:2:008:0	Yes indeed , it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures : “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
59:2:009:0	But if you favor some people over others , you are committing a sin . You are guilty of breaking the law .
59:2:010:0	For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God 's laws .
59:2:011:0	For the same God who said , “ You must not commit adultery , ” also said , “ You must not murder. ” So if you murder someone but do not commit adultery , you have still broken the law .
59:2:012:0	So whatever you say or whatever you do , remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free .
59:2:002:1	Faith without Good Deeds Is Dead
59:2:013:0	There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others . But if you have been merciful , God will be merciful when he judges you .
59:2:014:0	What good is it , dear brothers and sisters , if you say you have faith but do n't show it by your actions ? Can that kind of faith save anyone ?
59:2:015:0	Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing ,
59:2:016:0	and you say , “ Good-bye and have a good day ; stay warm and eat well ” — but then you do n't give that person any food or clothing . What good does that do ?
59:2:017:0	So you see , faith by itself is n't enough . Unless it produces good deeds , it is dead and useless .
59:2:018:0	Now someone may argue , “ Some people have faith ; others have good deeds. ” But I say , “ How can you show me your faith if you do n't have good deeds ? I will show you my faith by my good deeds . ”
59:2:019:0	You say you have faith , for you believe that there is one God . Good for you ! Even the demons believe this , and they tremble in terror .
59:2:020:0	How foolish ! Ca n't you see that faith without good deeds is useless ?
59:2:021:0	Do n't you remember that our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right with God by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
59:2:022:0	You see , his faith and his actions worked together . His actions made his faith complete .
59:2:023:0	And so it happened just as the Scriptures say : “ Abraham believed God , and God counted him as righteous because of his faith. ” He was even called the friend of God .
59:2:024:0	So you see , we are shown to be right with God by what we do , not by faith alone .
59:2:025:0	Rahab the prostitute is another example . She was shown to be right with God by her actions when she hid those messengers and sent them safely away by a different road .
59:2:026:0	Just as the body is dead without breath , so also faith is dead without good works .
