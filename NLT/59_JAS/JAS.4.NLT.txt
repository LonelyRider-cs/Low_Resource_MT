59:4:001:1	Drawing Close to God
59:4:001:0	What is causing the quarrels and fights among you ? Do n't they come from the evil desires at war within you ?
59:4:002:0	You want what you do n't have , so you scheme and kill to get it . You are jealous of what others have , but you ca n't get it , so you fight and wage war to take it away from them . Yet you do n't have what you want because you do n't ask God for it .
59:4:003:0	And even when you ask , you do n't get it because your motives are all wrong — you want only what will give you pleasure .
59:4:004:0	You adulterers ! Do n't you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God ? I say it again : If you want to be a friend of the world , you make yourself an enemy of God .
59:4:005:0	Do you think the Scriptures have no meaning ? They say that God is passionate that the spirit he has placed within us should be faithful to him .
59:4:006:0	And he gives grace generously . As the Scriptures say , “ God opposes the proudbut gives grace to the humble . ”
59:4:007:0	So humble yourselves before God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
59:4:008:0	Come close to God , and God will come close to you . Wash your hands , you sinners ; purify your hearts , for your loyalty is divided between God and the world .
59:4:009:0	Let there be tears for what you have done . Let there be sorrow and deep grief . Let there be sadness instead of laughter , and gloom instead of joy .
59:4:002:1	Warning against Judging Others
59:4:010:0	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up in honor .
59:4:011:0	Do n't speak evil against each other , dear brothers and sisters . If you criticize and judge each other , then you are criticizing and judging God 's law . But your job is to obey the law , not to judge whether it applies to you .
59:4:003:1	Warning about Self-Confidence
59:4:012:0	God alone , who gave the law , is the Judge . He alone has the power to save or to destroy . So what right do you have to judge your neighbor ?
59:4:013:0	Look here , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a year . We will do business there and make a profit . ”
59:4:014:0	How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow ? Your life is like the morning fog — it 's here a little while , then it 's gone .
59:4:015:0	What you ought to say is , “ If the Lord wants us to , we will live and do this or that . ”
59:4:016:0	Otherwise you are boasting about your own pretentious plans , and all such boasting is evil .
59:4:017:0	Remember , it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it .
