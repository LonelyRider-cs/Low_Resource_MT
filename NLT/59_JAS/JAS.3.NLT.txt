59:3:001:1	Controlling the Tongue
59:3:001:0	Dear brothers and sisters , not many of you should become teachers in the church , for we who teach will be judged more strictly .
59:3:002:0	Indeed , we all make many mistakes . For if we could control our tongues , we would be perfect and could also control ourselves in every other way .
59:3:003:0	We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its mouth .
59:3:004:0	And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go , even though the winds are strong .
59:3:005:0	In the same way , the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches.But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire .
59:3:006:0	And among all the parts of the body , the tongue is a flame of fire . It is a whole world of wickedness , corrupting your entire body . It can set your whole life on fire , for it is set on fire by hell itself .
59:3:007:0	People can tame all kinds of animals , birds , reptiles , and fish ,
59:3:008:0	but no one can tame the tongue . It is restless and evil , full of deadly poison .
59:3:009:0	Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father , and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God .
59:3:010:0	And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth . Surely , my brothers and sisters , this is not right !
59:3:011:0	Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water ?
59:3:002:1	True Wisdom Comes from God
59:3:012:0	Does a fig tree produce olives , or a grapevine produce figs ? No , and you ca n't draw fresh water from a salty spring .
59:3:013:0	If you are wise and understand God 's ways , prove it by living an honorable life , doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom .
59:3:014:0	But if you are bitterly jealous and there is selfish ambition in your heart , do n't cover up the truth with boasting and lying .
59:3:015:0	For jealousy and selfishness are not God 's kind of wisdom . Such things are earthly , unspiritual , and demonic .
59:3:016:0	For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition , there you will find disorder and evil of every kind .
59:3:017:0	But the wisdom from above is first of all pure . It is also peace loving , gentle at all times , and willing to yield to others . It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds . It shows no favoritism and is always sincere .
59:3:018:0	And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness .
