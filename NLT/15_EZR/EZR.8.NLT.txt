15:8:002:1	Ezra 's Journey to Jerusalem
15:8:014:0	From the family of Bigvai : Uthai , Zaccur , and 70 other men .
15:8:015:0	I assembled the exiles at the Ahava Canal , and we camped there for three days while I went over the lists of the people and the priests who had arrived . I found that not one Levite had volunteered to come along .
15:8:016:0	So I sent for Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and Meshullam , who were leaders of the people . I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan , who were men of discernment .
15:8:017:0	I sent them to Iddo , the leader of the Levites at Casiphia , to ask him and his relatives and the Temple servants to send us ministers for the Temple of God at Jerusalem .
15:8:018:0	Since the gracious hand of our God was on us , they sent us a man named Sherebiah , along with eighteen of his sons and brothers . He was a very astute man and a descendant of Mahli , who was a descendant of Levi son of Israel .
15:8:019:0	They also sent Hashabiah , together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari , and twenty of his sons and brothers ,
15:8:020:0	and 220 Temple servants . The Temple servants were assistants to the Levites — a group of Temple workers first instituted by King David and his officials . They were all listed by name .
15:8:021:0	And there by the Ahava Canal , I gave orders for all of us to fast and humble ourselves before our God . We prayed that he would give us a safe journey and protect us , our children , and our goods as we traveled .
15:8:022:0	For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to accompany us and protect us from enemies along the way . After all , we had told the king , “ Our God 's hand of protection is on all who worship him , but his fierce anger rages against those who abandon him . ”
15:8:023:0	So we fasted and earnestly prayed that our God would take care of us , and he heard our prayer .
15:8:024:0	I appointed twelve leaders of the priests — Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten other priests —
15:8:025:0	to be in charge of transporting the silver , the gold , the gold bowls , and the other items that the king , his council , his officials , and all the people of Israel had presented for the Temple of God .
15:8:026:0	I weighed the treasure as I gave it to them and found the totals to be as follows:24 tons of silver,7,500 pounds of silver articles,7,500 pounds of gold ,
15:8:027:0	20 gold bowls , equal in value to 1,000 gold coins,2 fine articles of polished bronze , as precious as gold .
15:8:028:0	And I said to these priests , “ You and these treasures have been set apart as holy to the Lord . This silver and gold is a voluntary offering to the Lord , the God of our ancestors .
15:8:029:0	Guard these treasures well until you present them to the leading priests , the Levites , and the leaders of Israel , who will weigh them at the storerooms of the Lord 's Temple in Jerusalem . ”
15:8:030:0	So the priests and the Levites accepted the task of transporting these treasures of silver and gold to the Temple of our God in Jerusalem .
15:8:031:0	We broke camp at the Ahava Canal on April 19 and started off to Jerusalem . And the gracious hand of our God protected us and saved us from enemies and bandits along the way .
15:8:032:0	So we arrived safely in Jerusalem , where we rested for three days .
15:8:033:0	On the fourth day after our arrival , the silver , gold , and other valuables were weighed at the Temple of our God and entrusted to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest and to Eleazar son of Phinehas , along with Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui — both of whom were Levites .
15:8:034:0	Everything was accounted for by number and weight , and the total weight was officially recorded .
15:8:035:0	Then the exiles who had come out of captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel . They presented twelve bulls for all the people of Israel , as well as ninety-six rams and seventy-seven male lambs . They also offered twelve male goats as a sin offering . All this was given as a burnt offering to the Lord .
15:8:036:0	The king 's decrees were delivered to his highest officers and the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River , who then cooperated by supporting the people and the Temple of God .
