15:5:001:0	At that time the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem . They prophesied in the name of the God of Israel who was over them .
15:5:002:0	Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak responded by starting again to rebuild the Temple of God in Jerusalem . And the prophets of God were with them and helped them .
15:5:003:0	But Tattenai , governor of the province west of the Euphrates River , and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues soon arrived in Jerusalem and asked , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure ? ”
15:5:004:0	They also asked for the names of all the men working on the Temple .
15:5:001:1	Tattenai 's Letter to King Darius
15:5:005:0	But because their God was watching over them , the leaders of the Jews were not prevented from building until a report was sent to Darius and he returned his decision .
15:5:006:0	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor , Shethar-bozenai , and the other officials of the province west of the Euphrates River sent to King Darius :
15:5:007:0	“ To King Darius . Greetings .
15:5:008:0	“ The king should know that we went to the construction site of the Temple of the great God in the province of Judah . It is being rebuilt with specially prepared stones , and timber is being laid in its walls . The work is going forward with great energy and success .
15:5:009:0	“ We asked the leaders , ‘ Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure ? '
15:5:010:0	And we demanded their names so that we could tell you who the leaders were .
15:5:011:0	“ This was their answer : ‘ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth , and we are rebuilding the Temple that was built here many years ago by a great king of Israel .
15:5:012:0	But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven , he abandoned them to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , who destroyed this Temple and exiled the people to Babylonia .
15:5:013:0	However , King Cyrus of Babylon , during the first year of his reign , issued a decree that the Temple of God should be rebuilt .
15:5:014:0	King Cyrus returned the gold and silver cups that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of Babylon . These cups were taken from that temple and presented to a man named Sheshbazzar , whom King Cyrus appointed as governor of Judah .
15:5:015:0	The king instructed him to return the cups to their place in Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple of God there on its original site .
15:5:016:0	So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem . The people have been working on it ever since , though it is not yet completed . '
15:5:017:0	“ Therefore , if it pleases the king , we request that a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to discover whether King Cyrus ever issued a decree to rebuild God 's Temple in Jerusalem . And then let the king send us his decision in this matter . ”
