15:3:001:1	The Altar Is Rebuilt
15:3:001:0	In early autumn , when the Israelites had settled in their towns , all the people assembled in Jerusalem with a unified purpose .
15:3:002:0	Then Jeshua son of Jehozadak joined his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his family in rebuilding the altar of the God of Israel . They wanted to sacrifice burnt offerings on it , as instructed in the Law of Moses , the man of God .
15:3:003:0	Even though the people were afraid of the local residents , they rebuilt the altar at its old site . Then they began to sacrifice burnt offerings on the altar to the Lord each morning and evening .
15:3:004:0	They celebrated the Festival of Shelters as prescribed in the Law , sacrificing the number of burnt offerings specified for each day of the festival .
15:3:005:0	They also offered the regular burnt offerings and the offerings required for the new moon celebrations and the annual festivals as prescribed by the Lord . The people also gave voluntary offerings to the Lord .
15:3:002:1	The People Begin to Rebuild the Temple
15:3:006:0	Fifteen days before the Festival of Shelters began , the priests had begun to sacrifice burnt offerings to the Lord . This was even before they had started to lay the foundation of the Lord 's Temple .
15:3:007:0	Then the people hired masons and carpenters and bought cedar logs from the people of Tyre and Sidon , paying them with food , wine , and olive oil . The logs were brought down from the Lebanon mountains and floated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Joppa , for King Cyrus had given permission for this .
15:3:008:0	The construction of the Temple of God began in midspring , during the second year after they arrived in Jerusalem . The work force was made up of everyone who had returned from exile , including Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his fellow priests , and all the Levites . The Levites who were twenty years old or older were put in charge of rebuilding the Lord 's Temple .
15:3:009:0	The workers at the Temple of God were supervised by Jeshua with his sons and relatives , and Kadmiel and his sons , all descendants of Hodaviah . They were helped in this task by the Levites of the family of Henadad .
15:3:010:0	When the builders completed the foundation of the Lord 's Temple , the priests put on their robes and took their places to blow their trumpets . And the Levites , descendants of Asaph , clashed their cymbals to praise the Lord , just as King David had prescribed .
15:3:011:0	With praise and thanks , they sang this song to the Lord : “ He is so good ! His faithful love for Israel endures forever ! ” Then all the people gave a great shout , praising the Lord because the foundation of the Lord 's Temple had been laid .
15:3:012:0	But many of the older priests , Levites , and other leaders who had seen the first Temple wept aloud when they saw the new Temple 's foundation . The others , however , were shouting for joy .
15:3:013:0	The joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud noise that could be heard far in the distance .
