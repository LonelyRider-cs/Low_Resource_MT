15:4:001:1	Enemies Oppose the Rebuilding
15:4:001:0	The enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding a Temple to the Lord , the God of Israel .
15:4:002:0	So they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders and said , “ Let us build with you , for we worship your God just as you do . We have sacrificed to him ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here . ”
15:4:003:0	But Zerubbabel , Jeshua , and the other leaders of Israel replied , “ You may have no part in this work . We alone will build the Temple for the Lord , the God of Israel , just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us . ”
15:4:004:0	Then the local residents tried to discourage and frighten the people of Judah to keep them from their work .
15:4:002:1	Later Opposition under Xerxes and Artaxerxes
15:4:005:0	They bribed agents to work against them and to frustrate their plans . This went on during the entire reign of King Cyrus of Persia and lasted until King Darius of Persia took the throne .
15:4:006:0	Years later when Xerxes began his reign , the enemies of Judah wrote a letter of accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
15:4:007:0	Even later , during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia , the enemies of Judah , led by Bishlam , Mithredath , and Tabeel , sent a letter to Artaxerxes in the Aramaic language , and it was translated for the king .
15:4:008:0	Rehum the governor and Shimshai the court secretary wrote the letter , telling King Artaxerxes about the situation in Jerusalem .
15:4:009:0	They greeted the king for all their colleagues—the judges and local leaders , the people of Tarpel , the Persians , the Babylonians , and the people of Erech and Susa ( that is , Elam ) .
15:4:010:0	They also sent greetings from the rest of the people whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal had deported and relocated in Samaria and throughout the neighboring lands of the province west of the Euphrates River .
15:4:011:0	This is a copy of their letter : “ To King Artaxerxes , from your loyal subjects in the province west of the Euphrates River .
15:4:012:0	“ The king should know that the Jews who came here to Jerusalem from Babylon are rebuilding this rebellious and evil city . They have already laid the foundation and will soon finish its walls .
15:4:013:0	And the king should know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed , it will be much to your disadvantage , for the Jews will then refuse to pay their tribute , customs , and tolls to you .
15:4:014:0	“ Since we are your loyal subjects and do not want to see the king dishonored in this way , we have sent the king this information .
15:4:015:0	We suggest that a search be made in your ancestors ' records , where you will discover what a rebellious city this has been in the past . In fact , it was destroyed because of its long and troublesome history of revolt against the kings and countries who controlled it .
15:4:016:0	We declare to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed , the province west of the Euphrates River will be lost to you . ”
15:4:017:0	Then King Artaxerxes sent this reply : “ To Rehum the governor , Shimshai the court secretary , and their colleagues living in Samaria and throughout the province west of the Euphrates River . Greetings .
15:4:018:0	“ The letter you sent has been translated and read to me .
15:4:019:0	I ordered a search of the records and have found that Jerusalem has indeed been a hotbed of insurrection against many kings . In fact , rebellion and revolt are normal there !
15:4:020:0	Powerful kings have ruled over Jerusalem and the entire province west of the Euphrates River , receiving tribute , customs , and tolls .
15:4:021:0	Therefore , issue orders to have these men stop their work . That city must not be rebuilt except at my express command .
15:4:022:0	Be diligent , and do n't neglect this matter , for we must not permit the situation to harm the king 's interests . ”
15:4:003:1	The Rebuilding Resumes
15:4:023:0	When this letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum , Shimshai , and their colleagues , they hurried to Jerusalem . Then , with a show of strength , they forced the Jews to stop building .
15:4:024:0	So the work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem had stopped , and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia .
