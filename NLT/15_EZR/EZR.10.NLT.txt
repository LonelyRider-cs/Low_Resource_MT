15:10:001:1	The People Confess Their Sin
15:10:001:0	While Ezra prayed and made this confession , weeping and lying face down on the ground in front of the Temple of God , a very large crowd of people from Israel — men , women , and children — gathered and wept bitterly with him .
15:10:002:0	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel , a descendant of Elam , said to Ezra , “ We have been unfaithful to our God , for we have married these pagan women of the land . But in spite of this there is hope for Israel .
15:10:003:0	Let us now make a covenant with our God to divorce our pagan wives and to send them away with their children . We will follow the advice given by you and by the others who respect the commands of our God . Let it be done according to the Law of God .
15:10:004:0	Get up , for it is your duty to tell us how to proceed in setting things straight . We are behind you , so be strong and take action . ”
15:10:005:0	So Ezra stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests and the Levites and all the people of Israel swear that they would do as Shecaniah had said . And they all swore a solemn oath .
15:10:006:0	Then Ezra left the front of the Temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib . He spent the night there without eating or drinking anything . He was still in mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the returned exiles .
15:10:007:0	Then a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should come to Jerusalem .
15:10:008:0	Those who failed to come within three days would , if the leaders and elders so decided , forfeit all their property and be expelled from the assembly of the exiles .
15:10:009:0	Within three days , all the people of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem . This took place on December 19 , and all the people were sitting in the square before the Temple of God . They were trembling both because of the seriousness of the matter and because it was raining .
15:10:010:0	Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them : “ You have committed a terrible sin . By marrying pagan women , you have increased Israel 's guilt .
15:10:011:0	So now confess your sin to the Lord , the God of your ancestors , and do what he demands . Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from these pagan women . ”
15:10:012:0	Then the whole assembly raised their voices and answered , “ Yes , you are right ; we must do as you say ! ”
15:10:013:0	Then they added , “ This is n't something that can be done in a day or two , for many of us are involved in this extremely sinful affair . And this is the rainy season , so we can not stay out here much longer .
15:10:014:0	Let our leaders act on behalf of us all . Let everyone who has a pagan wife come at a scheduled time , accompanied by the leaders and judges of his city , so that the fierce anger of our God concerning this affair may be turned away from us . ”
15:10:015:0	Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this course of action , and they were supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite .
15:10:016:0	So this was the plan they followed . Ezra selected leaders to represent their families , designating each of the representatives by name . On December 29 , the leaders sat down to investigate the matter .
