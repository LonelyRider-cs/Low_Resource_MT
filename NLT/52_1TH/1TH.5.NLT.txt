52:5:001:0	Now concerning how and when all this will happen , dear brothers and sisters , we do n't really need to write you .
52:5:002:0	For you know quite well that the day of the Lord 's return will come unexpectedly , like a thief in the night .
52:5:003:0	When people are saying , “ Everything is peaceful and secure , ” then disaster will fall on them as suddenly as a pregnant woman 's labor pains begin . And there will be no escape .
52:5:004:0	But you are n't in the dark about these things , dear brothers and sisters , and you wo n't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief .
52:5:005:0	For you are all children of the light and of the day ; we do n't belong to darkness and night .
52:5:006:0	So be on your guard , not asleep like the others . Stay alert and be clearheaded .
52:5:007:0	Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk .
52:5:008:0	But let us who live in the light be clearheaded , protected by the armor of faith and love , and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation .
52:5:009:0	For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ , not to pour out his anger on us .
52:5:010:0	Christ died for us so that , whether we are dead or alive when he returns , we can live with him forever .
52:5:001:1	Paul 's Final Advice
52:5:011:0	So encourage each other and build each other up , just as you are already doing .
52:5:012:0	Dear brothers and sisters , honor those who are your leaders in the Lord 's work . They work hard among you and give you spiritual guidance .
52:5:013:0	Show them great respect and wholehearted love because of their work . And live peacefully with each other .
52:5:014:0	Brothers and sisters , we urge you to warn those who are lazy . Encourage those who are timid . Take tender care of those who are weak . Be patient with everyone .
52:5:015:0	See that no one pays back evil for evil , but always try to do good to each other and to all people .
52:5:016:0	Always be joyful .
52:5:017:0	Never stop praying .
52:5:018:0	Be thankful in all circumstances , for this is God 's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus .
52:5:019:0	Do not stifle the Holy Spirit .
52:5:020:0	Do not scoff at prophecies ,
52:5:021:0	but test everything that is said . Hold on to what is good .
52:5:002:1	Paul 's Final Greetings
52:5:022:0	Stay away from every kind of evil .
52:5:023:0	Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way , and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
52:5:024:0	God will make this happen , for he who calls you is faithful .
52:5:025:0	Dear brothers and sisters , pray for us .
52:5:026:0	Greet all the brothers and sisters with a sacred kiss .
52:5:027:0	I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters .
52:5:028:0	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
