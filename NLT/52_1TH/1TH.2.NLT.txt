52:2:001:1	Paul Remembers His Visit
52:2:001:0	You yourselves know , dear brothers and sisters , that our visit to you was not a failure .
52:2:002:0	You know how badly we had been treated at Philippi just before we came to you and how much we suffered there . Yet our God gave us the courage to declare his Good News to you boldly , in spite of great opposition .
52:2:003:0	So you can see we were not preaching with any deceit or impure motives or trickery .
52:2:004:0	For we speak as messengers approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News . Our purpose is to please God , not people . He alone examines the motives of our hearts .
52:2:005:0	Never once did we try to win you with flattery , as you well know . And God is our witness that we were not pretending to be your friends just to get your money !
52:2:006:0	As for human praise , we have never sought it from you or anyone else .
52:2:007:0	As apostles of Christ we certainly had a right to make some demands of you , but instead we were like children among you . Or we were like a mother feeding and caring for her own children .
52:2:008:0	We loved you so much that we shared with you not only God 's Good News but our own lives , too .
52:2:009:0	Do n't you remember , dear brothers and sisters , how hard we worked among you ? Night and day we toiled to earn a living so that we would not be a burden to any of you as we preached God 's Good News to you .
52:2:010:0	You yourselves are our witnesses—and so is God—that we were devout and honest and faultless toward all of you believers .
52:2:011:0	And you know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children .
52:2:012:0	We pleaded with you , encouraged you , and urged you to live your lives in a way that God would consider worthy . For he called you to share in his Kingdom and glory .
52:2:013:0	Therefore , we never stop thanking God that when you received his message from us , you did n't think of our words as mere human ideas . You accepted what we said as the very word of God—which , of course , it is . And this word continues to work in you who believe .
52:2:014:0	And then , dear brothers and sisters , you suffered persecution from your own countrymen . In this way , you imitated the believers in God 's churches in Judea who , because of their belief in Christ Jesus , suffered from their own people , the Jews .
52:2:015:0	For some of the Jews killed the prophets , and some even killed the Lord Jesus . Now they have persecuted us , too . They fail to please God and work against all humanity
52:2:002:1	Timothy 's Good Report about the Church
52:2:016:0	as they try to keep us from preaching the Good News of salvation to the Gentiles . By doing this , they continue to pile up their sins . But the anger of God has caught up with them at last .
52:2:017:0	Dear brothers and sisters , after we were separated from you for a little while ( though our hearts never left you ) , we tried very hard to come back because of our intense longing to see you again .
52:2:018:0	We wanted very much to come to you , and I , Paul , tried again and again , but Satan prevented us .
52:2:019:0	After all , what gives us hope and joy , and what will be our proud reward and crown as we stand before our Lord Jesus when he returns ? It is you !
52:2:020:0	Yes , you are our pride and joy .
