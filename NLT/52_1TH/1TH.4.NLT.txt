52:4:001:1	Live to Please God
52:4:001:0	Finally , dear brothers and sisters , we urge you in the name of the Lord Jesus to live in a way that pleases God , as we have taught you . You live this way already , and we encourage you to do so even more .
52:4:002:0	For you remember what we taught you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52:4:003:0	God 's will is for you to be holy , so stay away from all sexual sin .
52:4:004:0	Then each of you will control his own body and live in holiness and honor â€”
52:4:005:0	not in lustful passion like the pagans who do not know God and his ways .
52:4:006:0	Never harm or cheat a fellow believer in this matter by violating his wife , for the Lord avenges all such sins , as we have solemnly warned you before .
52:4:007:0	God has called us to live holy lives , not impure lives .
52:4:008:0	Therefore , anyone who refuses to live by these rules is not disobeying human teaching but is rejecting God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .
52:4:009:0	But we do n't need to write to you about the importance of loving each other , for God himself has taught you to love one another .
52:4:010:0	Indeed , you already show your love for all the believers throughout Macedonia . Even so , dear brothers and sisters , we urge you to love them even more .
52:4:011:0	Make it your goal to live a quiet life , minding your own business and working with your hands , just as we instructed you before .
52:4:002:1	The Hope of the Resurrection
52:4:012:0	Then people who are not believers will respect the way you live , and you will not need to depend on others .
52:4:013:0	And now , dear brothers and sisters , we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died so you will not grieve like people who have no hope .
52:4:014:0	For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again , we also believe that when Jesus returns , God will bring back with him the believers who have died .
52:4:015:0	We tell you this directly from the Lord : We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet him ahead of those who have died .
52:4:016:0	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trumpet call of God . First , the believers who have died will rise from their graves .
52:4:017:0	Then , together with them , we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . Then we will be with the Lord forever .
52:4:018:0	So encourage each other with these words .
