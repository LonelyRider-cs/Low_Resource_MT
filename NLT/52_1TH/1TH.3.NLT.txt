52:3:001:0	Finally , when we could stand it no longer , we decided to stay alone in Athens ,
52:3:002:0	and we sent Timothy to visit you . He is our brother and God 's co-worker in proclaiming the Good News of Christ . We sent him to strengthen you , to encourage you in your faith ,
52:3:003:0	and to keep you from being shaken by the troubles you were going through . But you know that we are destined for such troubles .
52:3:004:0	Even while we were with you , we warned you that troubles would soon come â€” and they did , as you well know .
52:3:005:0	That is why , when I could bear it no longer , I sent Timothy to find out whether your faith was still strong . I was afraid that the tempter had gotten the best of you and that our work had been useless .
52:3:006:0	But now Timothy has just returned , bringing us good news about your faith and love . He reports that you always remember our visit with joy and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you .
52:3:007:0	So we have been greatly encouraged in the midst of our troubles and suffering , dear brothers and sisters , because you have remained strong in your faith .
52:3:008:0	It gives us new life to know that you are standing firm in the Lord .
52:3:009:0	How we thank God for you ! Because of you we have great joy as we enter God 's presence .
52:3:010:0	Night and day we pray earnestly for you , asking God to let us see you again to fill the gaps in your faith .
52:3:011:0	May God our Father and our Lord Jesus bring us to you very soon .
52:3:012:0	And may the Lord make your love for one another and for all people grow and overflow , just as our love for you overflows .
52:3:013:0	May he , as a result , make your hearts strong , blameless , and holy as you stand before God our Father when our Lord Jesus comes again with all his holy people . Amen .
