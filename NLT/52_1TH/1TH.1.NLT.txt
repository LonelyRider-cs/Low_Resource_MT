52:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
52:1:002:1	The Faith of the Thessalonian Believers
52:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul , Silas , and Timothy.We are writing to the church in Thessalonica , to you who belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.May God give you grace and peace .
52:1:002:0	We always thank God for all of you and pray for you constantly .
52:1:003:0	As we pray to our God and Father about you , we think of your faithful work , your loving deeds , and the enduring hope you have because of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52:1:004:0	We know , dear brothers and sisters , that God loves you and has chosen you to be his own people .
52:1:005:0	For when we brought you the Good News , it was not only with words but also with power , for the Holy Spirit gave you full assurance that what we said was true . And you know of our concern for you from the way we lived when we were with you .
52:1:006:0	So you received the message with joy from the Holy Spirit in spite of the severe suffering it brought you . In this way , you imitated both us and the Lord .
52:1:007:0	As a result , you have become an example to all the believers in Greece — throughout both Macedonia and Achaia .
52:1:008:0	And now the word of the Lord is ringing out from you to people everywhere , even beyond Macedonia and Achaia , for wherever we go we find people telling us about your faith in God . We do n't need to tell them about it ,
52:1:009:0	for they keep talking about the wonderful welcome you gave us and how you turned away from idols to serve the living and true God .
52:1:010:0	And they speak of how you are looking forward to the coming of God 's Son from heaven — Jesus , whom God raised from the dead . He is the one who has rescued us from the terrors of the coming judgment .
