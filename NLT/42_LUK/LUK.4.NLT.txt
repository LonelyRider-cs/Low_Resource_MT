42:4:001:1	The Temptation of Jesus
42:4:001:0	Then Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan River . He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness ,
42:4:002:0	where he was tempted by the devil for forty days . Jesus ate nothing all that time and became very hungry .
42:4:003:0	Then the devil said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , tell this stone to become a loaf of bread . ”
42:4:004:0	But Jesus told him , “ No ! The Scriptures say , ‘ People do not live by bread alone . ' ”
42:4:005:0	Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
42:4:006:0	“ I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them , ” the devil said , “ because they are mine to give to anyone I please .
42:4:007:0	I will give it all to you if you will worship me . ”
42:4:008:0	Jesus replied , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ You must worship the your Godand serve only him . ' ”
42:4:009:0	Then the devil took him to Jerusalem , to the highest point of the Temple , and said , “ If you are the Son of God , jump off !
42:4:010:0	For the Scriptures say , ‘ He will order his angels to protect and guard you .
42:4:011:0	And they will hold you up with their handsso you wo n't even hurt your foot on a stone . ' ”
42:4:012:0	Jesus responded , “ The Scriptures also say , ‘ You must not test the your God . ' ”
42:4:002:1	Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
42:4:013:0	When the devil had finished tempting Jesus , he left him until the next opportunity came .
42:4:014:0	Then Jesus returned to Galilee , filled with the Holy Spirit 's power . Reports about him spread quickly through the whole region .
42:4:015:0	He taught regularly in their synagogues and was praised by everyone .
42:4:016:0	When he came to the village of Nazareth , his boyhood home , he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures .
42:4:017:0	The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written :
42:4:018:0	“ The Spirit of the is upon me , for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor.He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released , that the blind will see , that the oppressed will be set free ,
42:4:019:0	and that the time of the 's favor has come . ”
42:4:020:0	He rolled up the scroll , handed it back to the attendant , and sat down . All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently .
42:4:021:0	Then he began to speak to them . “ The Scripture you 've just heard has been fulfilled this very day ! ”
42:4:022:0	Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips . “ How can this be ? ” they asked . “ Is n't this Joseph 's son ? ”
42:4:023:0	Then he said , “ You will undoubtedly quote me this proverb : ‘ Physician , heal yourself'—meaning , ‘ Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum . '
42:4:024:0	But I tell you the truth , no prophet is accepted in his own hometown .
42:4:025:0	“ Certainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah 's time , when the heavens were closed for three and a half years , and a severe famine devastated the land .
42:4:026:0	Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them . He was sent instead to a foreigner—a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon .
42:4:027:0	And many in Israel had leprosy in the time of the prophet Elisha , but the only one healed was Naaman , a Syrian . ”
42:4:028:0	When they heard this , the people in the synagogue were furious .
42:4:029:0	Jumping up , they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built . They intended to push him over the cliff ,
42:4:003:1	Jesus Casts Out a Demon
42:4:030:0	but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way .
42:4:031:0	Then Jesus went to Capernaum , a town in Galilee , and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day .
42:4:032:0	There , too , the people were amazed at his teaching , for he spoke with authority .
42:4:033:0	Once when he was in the synagogue , a man possessed by a demon—an evil spirit—cried out , shouting ,
42:4:034:0	“ Go away ! Why are you interfering with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are—the Holy One of God ! ”
42:4:035:0	But Jesus reprimanded him . “ Be quiet ! Come out of the man , ” he ordered . At that , the demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched ; then it came out of him without hurting him further .
42:4:036:0	Amazed , the people exclaimed , “ What authority and power this man 's words possess ! Even evil spirits obey him , and they flee at his command ! ”
42:4:004:1	Jesus Heals Many People
42:4:037:0	The news about Jesus spread through every village in the entire region .
42:4:038:0	After leaving the synagogue that day , Jesus went to Simon 's home , where he found Simon 's mother-in-law very sick with a high fever . “ Please heal her , ” everyone begged .
42:4:039:0	Standing at her bedside , he rebuked the fever , and it left her . And she got up at once and prepared a meal for them .
42:4:040:0	As the sun went down that evening , people throughout the village brought sick family members to Jesus . No matter what their diseases were , the touch of his hand healed every one .
42:4:005:1	Jesus Continues to Preach
42:4:041:0	Many were possessed by demons ; and the demons came out at his command , shouting , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But because they knew he was the Messiah , he rebuked them and refused to let them speak .
42:4:042:0	Early the next morning Jesus went out to an isolated place . The crowds searched everywhere for him , and when they finally found him , they begged him not to leave them .
42:4:043:0	But he replied , “ I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other towns , too , because that is why I was sent . ”
42:4:044:0	So he continued to travel around , preaching in synagogues throughout Judea .
