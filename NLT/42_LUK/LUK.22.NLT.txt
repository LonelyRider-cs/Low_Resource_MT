42:22:001:1	Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus
42:22:001:0	The Festival of Unleavened Bread , which is also called Passover , was approaching .
42:22:002:0	The leading priests and teachers of religious law were plotting how to kill Jesus , but they were afraid of the people 's reaction .
42:22:003:0	Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve disciples ,
42:22:004:0	and he went to the leading priests and captains of the Temple guard to discuss the best way to betray Jesus to them .
42:22:005:0	They were delighted , and they promised to give him money .
42:22:002:1	The Last Supper
42:22:006:0	So he agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus so they could arrest him when the crowds were n't around .
42:22:007:0	Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread arrived , when the Passover lamb is sacrificed .
42:22:008:0	Jesus sent Peter and John ahead and said , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal , so we can eat it together . ”
42:22:009:0	“ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ” they asked him .
42:22:010:0	He replied , “ As soon as you enter Jerusalem , a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you . Follow him . At the house he enters ,
42:22:011:0	say to the owner , ‘ The Teacher asks : Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? '
42:22:012:0	He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up . That is where you should prepare our meal . ”
42:22:013:0	They went off to the city and found everything just as Jesus had said , and they prepared the Passover meal there .
42:22:014:0	When the time came , Jesus and the apostles sat down together at the table .
42:22:015:0	Jesus said , “ I have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins .
42:22:016:0	For I tell you now that I wo n't eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God . ”
42:22:017:0	Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it . Then he said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves .
42:22:018:0	For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come . ”
42:22:019:0	He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it . Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples , saying , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
42:22:020:0	After supper he took another cup of wine and said , “ This cup is the new covenant between God and his people—an agreement confirmed with my blood , which is poured out as a sacrifice for you .
42:22:021:0	“ But here at this table , sitting among us as a friend , is the man who will betray me .
42:22:022:0	For it has been determined that the Son of Man must die . But what sorrow awaits the one who betrays him . ”
42:22:023:0	The disciples began to ask each other which of them would ever do such a thing .
42:22:024:0	Then they began to argue among themselves about who would be the greatest among them .
42:22:025:0	Jesus told them , “ In this world the kings and great men lord it over their people , yet they are called ‘ friends of the people . '
42:22:026:0	But among you it will be different . Those who are the greatest among you should take the lowest rank , and the leader should be like a servant .
42:22:027:0	Who is more important , the one who sits at the table or the one who serves ? The one who sits at the table , of course . But not here ! For I am among you as one who serves .
42:22:028:0	“ You have stayed with me in my time of trial .
42:22:029:0	And just as my Father has granted me a Kingdom , I now grant you the right
42:22:003:1	Jesus Predicts Peter 's Denial
42:22:030:0	to eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom . And you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42:22:031:0	“ Simon , Simon , Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat .
42:22:032:0	But I have pleaded in prayer for you , Simon , that your faith should not fail . So when you have repented and turned to me again , strengthen your brothers . ”
42:22:033:0	Peter said , “ Lord , I am ready to go to prison with you , and even to die with you . ”
42:22:034:0	But Jesus said , “ Peter , let me tell you something . Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will deny three times that you even know me . ”
42:22:035:0	Then Jesus asked them , “ When I sent you out to preach the Good News and you did not have money , a traveler 's bag , or an extra pair of sandals , did you need anything ? ” “ No , ” they replied .
42:22:036:0	“ But now , ” he said , “ take your money and a traveler 's bag . And if you do n't have a sword , sell your cloak and buy one !
42:22:037:0	For the time has come for this prophecy about me to be fulfilled : ‘ He was counted among the rebels . ' Yes , everything written about me by the prophets will come true . ”
42:22:004:1	Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives
42:22:038:0	“ Look , Lord , ” they replied , “ we have two swords among us. ” “ That 's enough , ” he said .
42:22:039:0	Then , accompanied by the disciples , Jesus left the upstairs room and went as usual to the Mount of Olives .
42:22:040:0	There he told them , “ Pray that you will not give in to temptation . ”
42:22:041:0	He walked away , about a stone 's throw , and knelt down and prayed ,
42:22:042:0	“ Father , if you are willing , please take this cup of suffering away from me . Yet I want your will to be done , not mine . ”
42:22:043:0	Then an angel from heaven appeared and strengthened him .
42:22:044:0	He prayed more fervently , and he was in such agony of spirit that his sweat fell to the ground like great drops of blood .
42:22:045:0	At last he stood up again and returned to the disciples , only to find them asleep , exhausted from grief .
42:22:005:1	Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested
42:22:046:0	“ Why are you sleeping ? ” he asked them . “ Get up and pray , so that you will not give in to temptation . ”
42:22:047:0	But even as Jesus said this , a crowd approached , led by Judas , one of the twelve disciples . Judas walked over to Jesus to greet him with a kiss .
42:22:048:0	But Jesus said , “ Judas , would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
42:22:049:0	When the other disciples saw what was about to happen , they exclaimed , “ Lord , should we fight ? We brought the swords ! ”
42:22:050:0	And one of them struck at the high priest 's slave , slashing off his right ear .
42:22:051:0	But Jesus said , “ No more of this. ” And he touched the man 's ear and healed him .
42:22:052:0	Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests , the captains of the Temple guard , and the elders who had come for him . “ Am I some dangerous revolutionary , ” he asked , “ that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me ?
42:22:006:1	Peter Denies Jesus
42:22:053:0	Why did n't you arrest me in the Temple ? I was there every day . But this is your moment , the time when the power of darkness reigns . ”
42:22:054:0	So they arrested him and led him to the high priest 's home . And Peter followed at a distance .
42:22:055:0	The guards lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it , and Peter joined them there .
42:22:056:0	A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him . Finally she said , “ This man was one of Jesus ' followers ! ”
42:22:057:0	But Peter denied it . “ Woman , ” he said , “ I do n't even know him ! ”
42:22:058:0	After a while someone else looked at him and said , “ You must be one of them ! ” “ No , man , I 'm not ! ” Peter retorted .
42:22:059:0	About an hour later someone else insisted , “ This must be one of them , because he is a Galilean , too . ”
42:22:060:0	But Peter said , “ Man , I do n't know what you are talking about. ” And immediately , while he was still speaking , the rooster crowed .
42:22:061:0	At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter . Suddenly , the Lord 's words flashed through Peter 's mind : “ Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will deny three times that you even know me . ”
42:22:062:0	And Peter left the courtyard , weeping bitterly .
42:22:063:0	The guards in charge of Jesus began mocking and beating him .
42:22:064:0	They blindfolded him and said , “ Prophesy to us ! Who hit you that time ? ”
42:22:007:1	Jesus before the Council
42:22:065:0	And they hurled all sorts of terrible insults at him .
42:22:066:0	At daybreak all the elders of the people assembled , including the leading priests and the teachers of religious law . Jesus was led before this high council ,
42:22:067:0	and they said , “ Tell us , are you the Messiah ? ” But he replied , “ If I tell you , you wo n't believe me .
42:22:068:0	And if I ask you a question , you wo n't answer .
42:22:069:0	But from now on the Son of Man will be seated in the place of power at God 's right hand . ”
42:22:070:0	They all shouted , “ So , are you claiming to be the Son of God ? ” And he replied , “ You say that I am . ”
42:22:071:0	“ Why do we need other witnesses ? ” they said . “ We ourselves heard him say it . ”
