42:12:001:1	A Warning against Hypocrisy
42:12:001:0	Meanwhile , the crowds grew until thousands were milling about and stepping on each other . Jesus turned first to his disciples and warned them , “ Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees—their hypocrisy .
42:12:002:0	The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed , and all that is secret will be made known to all .
42:12:003:0	Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear !
42:12:004:0	“ Dear friends , do n't be afraid of those who want to kill your body ; they can not do any more to you after that .
42:12:005:0	But I 'll tell you whom to fear . Fear God , who has the power to kill you and then throw you into hell . Yes , he 's the one to fear .
42:12:006:0	“ What is the price of five sparrows—two copper coins ? Yet God does not forget a single one of them .
42:12:007:0	And the very hairs on your head are all numbered . So do n't be afraid ; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows .
42:12:008:0	“ I tell you the truth , everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth , the Son of Man will also acknowledge in the presence of God 's angels .
42:12:009:0	But anyone who denies me here on earth will be denied before God 's angels .
42:12:010:0	Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven , but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42:12:011:0	“ And when you are brought to trial in the synagogues and before rulers and authorities , do n't worry about how to defend yourself or what to say ,
42:12:002:1	Parable of the Rich Fool
42:12:012:0	for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what needs to be said . ”
42:12:013:0	Then someone called from the crowd , “ Teacher , please tell my brother to divide our father 's estate with me . ”
42:12:014:0	Jesus replied , “ Friend , who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that ? ”
42:12:015:0	Then he said , “ Beware ! Guard against every kind of greed . Life is not measured by how much you own . ”
42:12:016:0	Then he told them a story : “ A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops .
42:12:017:0	He said to himself , ‘ What should I do ? I do n't have room for all my crops . '
42:12:018:0	Then he said , ‘ I know ! I 'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones . Then I 'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods .
42:12:019:0	And I 'll sit back and say to myself , “ My friend , you have enough stored away for years to come . Now take it easy ! Eat , drink , and be merry ! ” '
42:12:020:0	“ But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! You will die this very night . Then who will get everything you worked for ? '
42:12:003:1	Teaching about Money and Possessions
42:12:021:0	“ Yes , a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God . ”
42:12:022:0	Then , turning to his disciples , Jesus said , “ That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear .
42:12:023:0	For life is more than food , and your body more than clothing .
42:12:024:0	Look at the ravens . They do n't plant or harvest or store food in barns , for God feeds them . And you are far more valuable to him than any birds !
42:12:025:0	Can all your worries add a single moment to your life ?
42:12:026:0	And if worry ca n't accomplish a little thing like that , what 's the use of worrying over bigger things ?
42:12:027:0	“ Look at the lilies and how they grow . They do n't work or make their clothing , yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are .
42:12:028:0	And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow , he will certainly care for you . Why do you have so little faith ?
42:12:029:0	“ And do n't be concerned about what to eat and what to drink . Do n't worry about such things .
42:12:030:0	These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world , but your Father already knows your needs .
42:12:031:0	Seek the Kingdom of God above all else , and he will give you everything you need .
42:12:032:0	“ So do n't be afraid , little flock . For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom .
42:12:033:0	“ Sell your possessions and give to those in need . This will store up treasure for you in heaven ! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes . Your treasure will be safe ; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it .
42:12:004:1	Be Ready for the Lord 's Coming
42:12:034:0	Wherever your treasure is , there the desires of your heart will also be .
42:12:035:0	“ Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning ,
42:12:036:0	as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast . Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks .
42:12:037:0	The servants who are ready and waiting for his return will be rewarded . I tell you the truth , he himself will seat them , put on an apron , and serve them as they sit and eat !
42:12:038:0	He may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn . But whenever he comes , he will reward the servants who are ready .
42:12:039:0	“ Understand this : If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming , he would not permit his house to be broken into .
42:12:040:0	You also must be ready all the time , for the Son of Man will come when least expected . ”
42:12:041:0	Peter asked , “ Lord , is that illustration just for us or for everyone ? ”
42:12:042:0	And the Lord replied , “ A faithful , sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them .
42:12:043:0	If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job , there will be a reward .
42:12:044:0	I tell you the truth , the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns .
42:12:045:0	But what if the servant thinks , ‘ My master wo n't be back for a while , ' and he begins beating the other servants , partying , and getting drunk ?
42:12:046:0	The master will return unannounced and unexpected , and he will cut the servant in pieces and banish him with the unfaithful .
42:12:047:0	“ And a servant who knows what the master wants , but is n't prepared and does n't carry out those instructions , will be severely punished .
42:12:005:1	Jesus Causes Division
42:12:048:0	But someone who does not know , and then does something wrong , will be punished only lightly . When someone has been given much , much will be required in return ; and when someone has been entrusted with much , even more will be required .
42:12:049:0	“ I have come to set the world on fire , and I wish it were already burning !
42:12:050:0	I have a terrible baptism of suffering ahead of me , and I am under a heavy burden until it is accomplished .
42:12:051:0	Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth ? No , I have come to divide people against each other !
42:12:052:0	From now on families will be split apart , three in favor of me , and two against—or two in favor and three against .
42:12:053:0	‘ Father will be divided against sonand son against father ; mother against daughterand daughter against mother ; and mother-in-law against daughter-in-lawand daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . ' ”
42:12:054:0	Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said , “ When you see clouds beginning to form in the west , you say , ‘ Here comes a shower . ' And you are right .
42:12:055:0	When the south wind blows , you say , ‘ Today will be a scorcher . ' And it is .
42:12:056:0	You fools ! You know how to interpret the weather signs of the earth and sky , but you do n't know how to interpret the present times .
42:12:057:0	“ Why ca n't you decide for yourselves what is right ?
42:12:058:0	When you are on the way to court with your accuser , try to settle the matter before you get there . Otherwise , your accuser may drag you before the judge , who will hand you over to an officer , who will throw you into prison .
42:12:059:0	And if that happens , you wo n't be free again until you have paid the very last penny . ”
