42:20:001:1	The Authority of Jesus Challenged
42:20:001:0	One day as Jesus was teaching the people and preaching the Good News in the Temple , the leading priests , the teachers of religious law , and the elders came up to him .
42:20:002:0	They demanded , “ By what authority are you doing all these things ? Who gave you the right ? ”
42:20:003:0	“ Let me ask you a question first , ” he replied .
42:20:004:0	“ Did John 's authority to baptize come from heaven , or was it merely human ? ”
42:20:005:0	They talked it over among themselves . “ If we say it was from heaven , he will ask why we did n't believe John .
42:20:006:0	But if we say it was merely human , the people will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet . ”
42:20:007:0	So they finally replied that they did n't know .
42:20:002:1	Parable of the Evil Farmers
42:20:008:0	And Jesus responded , “ Then I wo n't tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
42:20:009:0	Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story : “ A man planted a vineyard , leased it to tenant farmers , and moved to another country to live for several years .
42:20:010:0	At the time of the grape harvest , he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop . But the farmers attacked the servant , beat him up , and sent him back empty-handed .
42:20:011:0	So the owner sent another servant , but they also insulted him , beat him up , and sent him away empty-handed .
42:20:012:0	A third man was sent , and they wounded him and chased him away .
42:20:013:0	“ ‘ What will I do ? ' the owner asked himself . ‘ I know ! I 'll send my cherished son . Surely they will respect him . '
42:20:014:0	“ But when the tenant farmers saw his son , they said to each other , ‘ Here comes the heir to this estate . Let 's kill him and get the estate for ourselves ! '
42:20:015:0	So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him. “ What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them ? ” Jesus asked .
42:20:016:0	“ I 'll tell you—he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others. ” “ How terrible that such a thing should ever happen , ” his listeners protested .
42:20:017:0	Jesus looked at them and said , “ Then what does this Scripture mean ? ‘ The stone that the builders rejectedhas now become the cornerstone . '
42:20:018:0	Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces , and it will crush anyone it falls on . ”
42:20:003:1	Taxes for Caesar
42:20:019:0	The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers . But they were afraid of the people 's reaction .
42:20:020:0	Watching for their opportunity , the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men . They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus .
42:20:021:0	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think . You teach the way of God truthfully .
42:20:022:0	Now tell us—is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
42:20:023:0	He saw through their trickery and said ,
42:20:024:0	“ Show me a Roman coin . Whose picture and title are stamped on it ? ” “ Caesar 's , ” they replied .
42:20:025:0	“ Well then , ” he said , “ give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God . ”
42:20:004:1	Discussion about Resurrection
42:20:026:0	So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people . Instead , they were amazed by his answer , and they became silent .
42:20:027:0	Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead .
42:20:028:0	They posed this question : “ Teacher , Moses gave us a law that if a man dies , leaving a wife but no children , his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother 's name .
42:20:029:0	Well , suppose there were seven brothers . The oldest one married and then died without children .
42:20:030:0	So the second brother married the widow , but he also died .
42:20:031:0	Then the third brother married her . This continued with all seven of them , who died without children .
42:20:032:0	Finally , the woman also died .
42:20:033:0	So tell us , whose wife will she be in the resurrection ? For all seven were married to her ! ”
42:20:034:0	Jesus replied , “ Marriage is for people here on earth .
42:20:035:0	But in the age to come , those worthy of being raised from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage .
42:20:036:0	And they will never die again . In this respect they will be like angels . They are children of God and children of the resurrection .
42:20:037:0	“ But now , as to whether the dead will be raised—even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush . Long after Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob had died , he referred to the Lord as ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
42:20:038:0	So he is the God of the living , not the dead , for they are all alive to him . ”
42:20:039:0	“ Well said , Teacher ! ” remarked some of the teachers of religious law who were standing there .
42:20:005:1	Whose Son Is the Messiah ?
42:20:040:0	And then no one dared to ask him any more questions .
42:20:041:0	Then Jesus presented them with a question . “ Why is it , ” he asked , “ that the Messiah is said to be the son of David ?
42:20:042:0	For David himself wrote in the book of Psalms : ‘ The said to my Lord , Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
42:20:043:0	until I humble your enemies , making them a footstool under your feet . '
42:20:044:0	Since David called the Messiah ‘ Lord , ' how can the Messiah be his son ? ”
42:20:045:0	Then , with the crowds listening , he turned to his disciples and said ,
42:20:046:0	“ Beware of these teachers of religious law ! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces . And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets .
42:20:047:0	Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public . Because of this , they will be severely punished . ”
