42:24:001:1	The Resurrection
42:24:001:0	But very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb , taking the spices they had prepared .
42:24:002:0	They found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance .
42:24:003:0	So they went in , but they did n't find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42:24:004:0	As they stood there puzzled , two men suddenly appeared to them , clothed in dazzling robes .
42:24:005:0	The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground . Then the men asked , “ Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive ?
42:24:006:0	He is n't here ! He is risen from the dead ! Remember what he told you back in Galilee ,
42:24:007:0	that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified , and that he would rise again on the third day . ”
42:24:008:0	Then they remembered that he had said this .
42:24:009:0	So they rushed back from the tomb to tell his eleven disciples — and everyone else — what had happened .
42:24:010:0	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and several other women who told the apostles what had happened .
42:24:011:0	But the story sounded like nonsense to the men , so they did n't believe it .
42:24:002:1	The Walk to Emmaus
42:24:012:0	However , Peter jumped up and ran to the tomb to look . Stooping , he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings ; then he went home again , wondering what had happened .
42:24:013:0	That same day two of Jesus ' followers were walking to the village of Emmaus , seven miles from Jerusalem .
42:24:014:0	As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened .
42:24:015:0	As they talked and discussed these things , Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them .
42:24:016:0	But God kept them from recognizing him .
42:24:017:0	He asked them , “ What are you discussing so intently as you walk along ? ” They stopped short , sadness written across their faces .
42:24:018:0	Then one of them , Cleopas , replied , “ You must be the only person in Jerusalem who has n't heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days . ”
42:24:019:0	“ What things ? ” Jesus asked. “ The things that happened to Jesus , the man from Nazareth , ” they said . “ He was a prophet who did powerful miracles , and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people .
42:24:020:0	But our leading priests and other religious leaders handed him over to be condemned to death , and they crucified him .
42:24:021:0	We had hoped he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel . This all happened three days ago .
42:24:022:0	“ Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning , and they came back with an amazing report .
42:24:023:0	They said his body was missing , and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive !
42:24:024:0	Some of our men ran out to see , and sure enough , his body was gone , just as the women had said . ”
42:24:025:0	Then Jesus said to them , “ You foolish people ! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures .
42:24:026:0	Was n't it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory ? ”
42:24:027:0	Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets , explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself .
42:24:028:0	By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey . Jesus acted as if he were going on ,
42:24:029:0	but they begged him , “ Stay the night with us , since it is getting late. ” So he went home with them .
42:24:030:0	As they sat down to eat , he took the bread and blessed it . Then he broke it and gave it to them .
42:24:031:0	Suddenly , their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . And at that moment he disappeared !
42:24:032:0	They said to each other , “ Did n't our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us ? ”
42:24:033:0	And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem . There they found the eleven disciples and the others who had gathered with them ,
42:24:003:1	Jesus Appears to the Disciples
42:24:034:0	who said , “ The Lord has really risen ! He appeared to Peter . ”
42:24:035:0	Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road , and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread .
42:24:036:0	And just as they were telling about it , Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them . “ Peace be with you , ” he said .
42:24:037:0	But the whole group was startled and frightened , thinking they were seeing a ghost !
42:24:038:0	“ Why are you frightened ? ” he asked . “ Why are your hearts filled with doubt ?
42:24:039:0	Look at my hands . Look at my feet . You can see that it 's really me . Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost , because ghosts do n't have bodies , as you see that I do . ”
42:24:040:0	As he spoke , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42:24:041:0	Still they stood there in disbelief , filled with joy and wonder . Then he asked them , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
42:24:042:0	They gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
42:24:043:0	and he ate it as they watched .
42:24:044:0	Then he said , “ When I was with you before , I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled . ”
42:24:045:0	Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures .
42:24:046:0	And he said , “ Yes , it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day .
42:24:047:0	It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations , beginning in Jerusalem : ‘ There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent . '
42:24:048:0	You are witnesses of all these things .
42:24:004:1	The Ascension
42:24:049:0	“ And now I will send the Holy Spirit , just as my Father promised . But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven . ”
42:24:050:0	Then Jesus led them to Bethany , and lifting his hands to heaven , he blessed them .
42:24:051:0	While he was blessing them , he left them and was taken up to heaven .
42:24:052:0	So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy .
42:24:053:0	And they spent all of their time in the Temple , praising God .
