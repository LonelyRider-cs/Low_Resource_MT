42:3:001:1	John the Baptist Prepares the Way
42:3:001:0	It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius , the Roman emperor . Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea ; Herod Antipas was ruler over Galilee ; his brother Philip was ruler over Iturea and Traconitis ; Lysanias was ruler over Abilene .
42:3:002:0	Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests . At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah , who was living in the wilderness .
42:3:003:0	Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River , preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven .
42:3:004:0	Isaiah had spoken of John when he said , “ He is a voice shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord 's coming ! Clear the road for him !
42:3:005:0	The valleys will be filled , and the mountains and hills made level.The curves will be straightened , and the rough places made smooth .
42:3:006:0	And then all people will seethe salvation sent from God . ' ”
42:3:007:0	When the crowds came to John for baptism , he said , “ You brood of snakes ! Who warned you to flee the coming wrath ?
42:3:008:0	Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God . Do n't just say to each other , ‘ We 're safe , for we are descendants of Abraham . ' That means nothing , for I tell you , God can create children of Abraham from these very stones .
42:3:009:0	Even now the ax of God 's judgment is poised , ready to sever the roots of the trees . Yes , every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire . ”
42:3:010:0	The crowds asked , “ What should we do ? ”
42:3:011:0	John replied , “ If you have two shirts , give one to the poor . If you have food , share it with those who are hungry . ”
42:3:012:0	Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked , “ Teacher , what should we do ? ”
42:3:013:0	He replied , “ Collect no more taxes than the government requires . ”
42:3:014:0	“ What should we do ? ” asked some soldiers.John replied , “ Do n't extort money or make false accusations . And be content with your pay . ”
42:3:015:0	Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon , and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah .
42:3:016:0	John answered their questions by saying , “ I baptize you with water ; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I 'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42:3:017:0	He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork . Then he will clean up the threshing area , gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire . ”
42:3:018:0	John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people .
42:3:019:0	John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas , the ruler of Galilee , for marrying Herodias , his brother 's wife , and for many other wrongs he had done .
