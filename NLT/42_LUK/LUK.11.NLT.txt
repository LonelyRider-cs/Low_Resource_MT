42:11:001:1	Teaching about Prayer
42:11:001:0	Once Jesus was in a certain place praying . As he finished , one of his disciples came to him and said , “ Lord , teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . ”
42:11:002:0	Jesus said , “ This is how you should pray : “ Father , may your name be kept holy.May your Kingdom come soon .
42:11:003:0	Give us each day the food we need ,
42:11:004:0	and forgive us our sins , as we forgive those who sin against us.And do n't let us yield to temptation . ”
42:11:005:0	Then , teaching them more about prayer , he used this story : “ Suppose you went to a friend 's house at midnight , wanting to borrow three loaves of bread . You say to him ,
42:11:006:0	‘ A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit , and I have nothing for him to eat . '
42:11:007:0	And suppose he calls out from his bedroom , ‘ Do n't bother me . The door is locked for the night , and my family and I are all in bed . I ca n't help you . '
42:11:008:0	But I tell you this — though he wo n't do it for friendship 's sake , if you keep knocking long enough , he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence .
42:11:009:0	“ And so I tell you , keep on asking , and you will receive what you ask for . Keep on seeking , and you will find . Keep on knocking , and the door will be opened to you .
42:11:010:0	For everyone who asks , receives . Everyone who seeks , finds . And to everyone who knocks , the door will be opened .
42:11:011:0	“ You fathers — if your children ask for a fish , do you give them a snake instead ?
42:11:012:0	Or if they ask for an egg , do you give them a scorpion ? Of course not !
42:11:002:1	Jesus and the Prince of Demons
42:11:013:0	So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him . ”
42:11:014:0	One day Jesus cast out a demon from a man who could n't speak , and when the demon was gone , the man began to speak . The crowds were amazed ,
42:11:015:0	but some of them said , “ No wonder he can cast out demons . He gets his power from Satan , the prince of demons . ”
42:11:016:0	Others , trying to test Jesus , demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority .
42:11:017:0	He knew their thoughts , so he said , “ Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed . A family splintered by feuding will fall apart .
42:11:018:0	You say I am empowered by Satan . But if Satan is divided and fighting against himself , how can his kingdom survive ?
42:11:019:0	And if I am empowered by Satan , what about your own exorcists ? They cast out demons , too , so they will condemn you for what you have said .
42:11:020:0	But if I am casting out demons by the power of God , then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you .
42:11:021:0	For when a strong man is fully armed and guards his palace , his possessions are safe —
42:11:022:0	until someone even stronger attacks and overpowers him , strips him of his weapons , and carries off his belongings .
42:11:023:0	“ Anyone who is n't with me opposes me , and anyone who is n't working with me is actually working against me .
42:11:024:0	“ When an evil spirit leaves a person , it goes into the desert , searching for rest . But when it finds none , it says , ‘ I will return to the person I came from . '
42:11:025:0	So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order .
42:11:026:0	Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they all enter the person and live there . And so that person is worse off than before . ”
42:11:027:0	As he was speaking , a woman in the crowd called out , “ God bless your mother — the womb from which you came , and the breasts that nursed you ! ”
42:11:003:1	The Sign of Jonah
42:11:028:0	Jesus replied , “ But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice . ”
42:11:029:0	As the crowd pressed in on Jesus , he said , “ This evil generation keeps asking me to show them a miraculous sign . But the only sign I will give them is the sign of Jonah .
42:11:030:0	What happened to him was a sign to the people of Nineveh that God had sent him . What happens to the Son of Man will be a sign to these people that he was sent by God .
42:11:031:0	“ The queen of Sheba will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it , for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon . Now someone greater than Solomon is here — but you refuse to listen .
42:11:004:1	Receiving the Light
42:11:032:0	The people of Nineveh will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it , for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah . Now someone greater than Jonah is here — but you refuse to repent .
42:11:033:0	“ No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a basket . Instead , a lamp is placed on a stand , where its light can be seen by all who enter the house .
42:11:034:0	“ Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is filled with light . But when it is unhealthy , your body is filled with darkness .
42:11:035:0	Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness .
42:11:005:1	Jesus Criticizes the Religious Leaders
42:11:036:0	If you are filled with light , with no dark corners , then your whole life will be radiant , as though a floodlight were filling you with light . ”
42:11:037:0	As Jesus was speaking , one of the Pharisees invited him home for a meal . So he went in and took his place at the table .
42:11:038:0	His host was amazed to see that he sat down to eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony required by Jewish custom .
42:11:039:0	Then the Lord said to him , “ You Pharisees are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish , but inside you are filthy — full of greed and wickedness !
42:11:040:0	Fools ! Did n't God make the inside as well as the outside ?
42:11:041:0	So clean the inside by giving gifts to the poor , and you will be clean all over .
42:11:042:0	“ What sorrow awaits you Pharisees ! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens , but you ignore justice and the love of God . You should tithe , yes , but do not neglect the more important things .
42:11:043:0	“ What sorrow awaits you Pharisees ! For you love to sit in the seats of honor in the synagogues and receive respectful greetings as you walk in the marketplaces .
42:11:044:0	Yes , what sorrow awaits you ! For you are like hidden graves in a field . People walk over them without knowing the corruption they are stepping on . ”
42:11:045:0	“ Teacher , ” said an expert in religious law , “ you have insulted us , too , in what you just said . ”
42:11:046:0	“ Yes , ” said Jesus , “ what sorrow also awaits you experts in religious law ! For you crush people with unbearable religious demands , and you never lift a finger to ease the burden .
42:11:047:0	What sorrow awaits you ! For you build monuments for the prophets your own ancestors killed long ago .
42:11:048:0	But in fact , you stand as witnesses who agree with what your ancestors did . They killed the prophets , and you join in their crime by building the monuments !
42:11:049:0	This is what God in his wisdom said about you : ‘ I will send prophets and apostles to them , but they will kill some and persecute the others . '
42:11:050:0	“ As a result , this generation will be held responsible for the murder of all God 's prophets from the creation of the world —
42:11:051:0	from the murder of Abel to the murder of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , it will certainly be charged against this generation .
42:11:052:0	“ What sorrow awaits you experts in religious law ! For you remove the key to knowledge from the people . You do n't enter the Kingdom yourselves , and you prevent others from entering . ”
42:11:053:0	As Jesus was leaving , the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees became hostile and tried to provoke him with many questions .
42:11:054:0	They wanted to trap him into saying something they could use against him .
