42:17:001:1	Teachings about Forgiveness and Faith
42:17:001:0	One day Jesus said to his disciples , “ There will always be temptations to sin , but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting !
42:17:002:0	It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin .
42:17:003:0	So watch yourselves ! “ If another believer sins , rebuke that person ; then if there is repentance , forgive .
42:17:004:0	Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness , you must forgive . ”
42:17:005:0	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Show us how to increase our faith . ”
42:17:006:0	The Lord answered , “ If you had faith even as small as a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ May you be uprooted and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you !
42:17:007:0	“ When a servant comes in from plowing or taking care of sheep , does his master say , ‘ Come in and eat with me ' ?
42:17:008:0	No , he says , ‘ Prepare my meal , put on your apron , and serve me while I eat . Then you can eat later . '
42:17:009:0	And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do ? Of course not .
42:17:002:1	Ten Healed of Leprosy
42:17:010:0	In the same way , when you obey me you should say , ‘ We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty . ' ”
42:17:011:0	As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem , he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria .
42:17:012:0	As he entered a village there , ten men with leprosy stood at a distance ,
42:17:013:0	crying out , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! ”
42:17:014:0	He looked at them and said , “ Go show yourselves to the priests. ” And as they went , they were cleansed of their leprosy .
42:17:015:0	One of them , when he saw that he was healed , came back to Jesus , shouting , “ Praise God ! ”
42:17:016:0	He fell to the ground at Jesus ' feet , thanking him for what he had done . This man was a Samaritan .
42:17:017:0	Jesus asked , “ Did n't I heal ten men ? Where are the other nine ?
42:17:018:0	Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner ? ”
42:17:003:1	The Coming of the Kingdom
42:17:019:0	And Jesus said to the man , “ Stand up and go . Your faith has healed you . ”
42:17:020:0	One day the Pharisees asked Jesus , “ When will the Kingdom of God come ? ” Jesus replied , “ The Kingdom of God ca n't be detected by visible signs .
42:17:021:0	You wo n't be able to say , ‘ Here it is ! ' or ‘ It 's over there ! ' For the Kingdom of God is already among you . ”
42:17:022:0	Then he said to his disciples , “ The time is coming when you will long to see the day when the Son of Man returns , but you wo n't see it .
42:17:023:0	People will tell you , ‘ Look , there is the Son of Man , ' or ‘ Here he is , ' but do n't go out and follow them .
42:17:024:0	For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other , so it will be on the day when the Son of Man comes .
42:17:025:0	But first the Son of Man must suffer terribly and be rejected by this generation .
42:17:026:0	“ When the Son of Man returns , it will be like it was in Noah 's day .
42:17:027:0	In those days , the people enjoyed banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42:17:028:0	“ And the world will be as it was in the days of Lot . People went about their daily business—eating and drinking , buying and selling , farming and building—
42:17:029:0	until the morning Lot left Sodom . Then fire and burning sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all .
42:17:030:0	Yes , it will be ‘ business as usual ' right up to the day when the Son of Man is revealed .
42:17:031:0	On that day a person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack . A person out in the field must not return home .
42:17:032:0	Remember what happened to Lot 's wife !
42:17:033:0	If you cling to your life , you will lose it , and if you let your life go , you will save it .
42:17:034:0	That night two people will be asleep in one bed ; one will be taken , the other left .
42:17:035:0	Two women will be grinding flour together at the mill ; one will be taken , the other left . ”
42:17:037:0	“ Where will this happen , Lord ? ” the disciples asked.Jesus replied , “ Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby , so these signs indicate that the end is near . ”
