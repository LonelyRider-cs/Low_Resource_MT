42:6:001:1	A Discussion about the Sabbath
42:6:001:0	One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields , his disciples broke off heads of grain , rubbed off the husks in their hands , and ate the grain .
42:6:002:0	But some Pharisees said , “ Why are you breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath ? ”
42:6:003:0	Jesus replied , “ Have n't you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
42:6:004:0	He went into the house of God and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests can eat . He also gave some to his companions . ”
42:6:002:1	Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
42:6:005:0	And Jesus added , “ The Son of Man is Lord , even over the Sabbath . ”
42:6:006:0	On another Sabbath day , a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching .
42:6:007:0	The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely . If he healed the man 's hand , they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath .
42:6:008:0	But Jesus knew their thoughts . He said to the man with the deformed hand , “ Come and stand in front of everyone. ” So the man came forward .
42:6:009:0	Then Jesus said to his critics , “ I have a question for you . Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath , or is it a day for doing evil ? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it ? ”
42:6:010:0	He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” So the man held out his hand , and it was restored !
42:6:003:1	Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles
42:6:011:0	At this , the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him .
42:6:012:0	One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray , and he prayed to God all night .
42:6:013:0	At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles . Here are their names :
42:6:014:0	Simon ( whom he named Peter ) , Andrew ( Peter 's brother ) , James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,
42:6:015:0	Matthew , Thomas , James ( son of Alphaeus ) , Simon ( who was called the zealot ) ,
42:6:004:1	Crowds Follow Jesus
42:6:016:0	Judas ( son of James ) , Judas Iscariot ( who later betrayed him ) .
42:6:017:0	When they came down from the mountain , the disciples stood with Jesus on a large , level area , surrounded by many of his followers and by the crowds . There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon .
42:6:018:0	They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases ; and those troubled by evil spirits were healed .
42:6:005:1	The Beatitudes
42:6:019:0	Everyone tried to touch him , because healing power went out from him , and he healed everyone .
42:6:020:0	Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said , “ God blesses you who are poor , for the Kingdom of God is yours .
42:6:021:0	God blesses you who are hungry now , for you will be satisfied.God blesses you who weep now , for in due time you will laugh .
42:6:022:0	What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man .
42:6:006:1	Sorrows Foretold
42:6:023:0	When that happens , be happy ! Yes , leap for joy ! For a great reward awaits you in heaven . And remember , their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way .
42:6:024:0	“ What sorrow awaits you who are rich , for you have your only happiness now .
42:6:025:0	What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now , for a time of awful hunger awaits you.What sorrow awaits you who laugh now , for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow .
42:6:007:1	Love for Enemies
42:6:026:0	What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds , for their ancestors also praised false prophets .
42:6:027:0	“ But to you who are willing to listen , I say , love your enemies ! Do good to those who hate you .
42:6:028:0	Bless those who curse you . Pray for those who hurt you .
42:6:029:0	If someone slaps you on one cheek , offer the other cheek also . If someone demands your coat , offer your shirt also .
42:6:030:0	Give to anyone who asks ; and when things are taken away from you , do n't try to get them back .
42:6:031:0	Do to others as you would like them to do to you .
42:6:032:0	“ If you love only those who love you , why should you get credit for that ? Even sinners love those who love them !
42:6:033:0	And if you do good only to those who do good to you , why should you get credit ? Even sinners do that much !
42:6:034:0	And if you lend money only to those who can repay you , why should you get credit ? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return .
42:6:035:0	“ Love your enemies ! Do good to them . Lend to them without expecting to be repaid . Then your reward from heaven will be very great , and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High , for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked .
42:6:008:1	Do Not Judge Others
42:6:036:0	You must be compassionate , just as your Father is compassionate .
42:6:037:0	“ Do not judge others , and you will not be judged . Do not condemn others , or it will all come back against you . Forgive others , and you will be forgiven .
42:6:038:0	Give , and you will receive . Your gift will return to you in full — pressed down , shaken together to make room for more , running over , and poured into your lap . The amount you give will determine the amount you get back . ”
42:6:039:0	Then Jesus gave the following illustration : “ Can one blind person lead another ? Wo n't they both fall into a ditch ?
42:6:040:0	Students are not greater than their teacher . But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher .
42:6:041:0	“ And why worry about a speck in your friend 's eye when you have a log in your own ?
42:6:009:1	The Tree and Its Fruit
42:6:042:0	How can you think of saying , ‘ Friend , let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye , ' when you ca n't see past the log in your own eye ? Hypocrite ! First get rid of the log in your own eye ; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend 's eye .
42:6:043:0	“ A good tree ca n't produce bad fruit , and a bad tree ca n't produce good fruit .
42:6:044:0	A tree is identified by its fruit . Figs are never gathered from thornbushes , and grapes are not picked from bramble bushes .
42:6:010:1	Building on a Solid Foundation
42:6:045:0	A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart , and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart . What you say flows from what is in your heart .
42:6:046:0	“ So why do you keep calling me ‘ Lord , Lord ! ' when you do n't do what I say ?
42:6:047:0	I will show you what it 's like when someone comes to me , listens to my teaching , and then follows it .
42:6:048:0	It is like a person building a house who digs deep and lays the foundation on solid rock . When the floodwaters rise and break against that house , it stands firm because it is well built .
42:6:049:0	But anyone who hears and does n't obey is like a person who builds a house right on the ground , without a foundation . When the floods sweep down against that house , it will collapse into a heap of ruins . ”
