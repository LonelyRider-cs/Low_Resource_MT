42:9:001:1	Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples
42:9:001:0	One day Jesus called together his twelve disciples and gave them power and authority to cast out all demons and to heal all diseases .
42:9:002:0	Then he sent them out to tell everyone about the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
42:9:003:0	“ Take nothing for your journey , ” he instructed them . “ Do n't take a walking stick , a traveler 's bag , food , money , or even a change of clothes .
42:9:004:0	Wherever you go , stay in the same house until you leave town .
42:9:005:0	And if a town refuses to welcome you , shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate . ”
42:9:002:1	Herod 's Confusion
42:9:006:0	So they began their circuit of the villages , preaching the Good News and healing the sick .
42:9:007:0	When Herod Antipas , the ruler of Galilee , heard about everything Jesus was doing , he was puzzled . Some were saying that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead .
42:9:008:0	Others thought Jesus was Elijah or one of the other prophets risen from the dead .
42:9:003:1	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand
42:9:009:0	“ I beheaded John , ” Herod said , “ so who is this man about whom I hear such stories ? ” And he kept trying to see him .
42:9:010:0	When the apostles returned , they told Jesus everything they had done . Then he slipped quietly away with them toward the town of Bethsaida .
42:9:011:0	But the crowds found out where he was going , and they followed him . He welcomed them and taught them about the Kingdom of God , and he healed those who were sick .
42:9:012:0	Late in the afternoon the twelve disciples came to him and said , “ Send the crowds away to the nearby villages and farms , so they can find food and lodging for the night . There is nothing to eat here in this remote place . ”
42:9:013:0	But Jesus said , “ You feed them. ” “ But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish , ” they answered . “ Or are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd ? ”
42:9:014:0	For there were about 5,000 men there.Jesus replied , “ Tell them to sit down in groups of about fifty each . ”
42:9:015:0	So the people all sat down .
42:9:016:0	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish , looked up toward heaven , and blessed them . Then , breaking the loaves into pieces , he kept giving the bread and fish to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people .
42:9:004:1	Peter 's Declaration about Jesus
42:9:017:0	They all ate as much as they wanted , and afterward , the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers !
42:9:018:0	One day Jesus left the crowds to pray alone . Only his disciples were with him , and he asked them , “ Who do people say I am ? ”
42:9:019:0	“ Well , ” they replied , “ some say John the Baptist , some say Elijah , and others say you are one of the other ancient prophets risen from the dead . ”
42:9:005:1	Jesus Predicts His Death
42:9:020:0	Then he asked them , “ But who do you say I am ? ” Peter replied , “ You are the Messiah sent from God ! ”
42:9:021:0	Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone who he was .
42:9:022:0	“ The Son of Man must suffer many terrible things , ” he said . “ He will be rejected by the elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of religious law . He will be killed , but on the third day he will be raised from the dead . ”
42:9:023:0	Then he said to the crowd , “ If any of you wants to be my follower , you must give up your own way , take up your cross daily , and follow me .
42:9:024:0	If you try to hang on to your life , you will lose it . But if you give up your life for my sake , you will save it .
42:9:025:0	And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed ?
42:9:026:0	If anyone is ashamed of me and my message , the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels .
42:9:006:1	The Transfiguration
42:9:027:0	I tell you the truth , some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God . ”
42:9:028:0	About eight days later Jesus took Peter , John , and James up on a mountain to pray .
42:9:029:0	And as he was praying , the appearance of his face was transformed , and his clothes became dazzling white .
42:9:030:0	Suddenly , two men , Moses and Elijah , appeared and began talking with Jesus .
42:9:031:0	They were glorious to see . And they were speaking about his exodus from this world , which was about to be fulfilled in Jerusalem .
42:9:032:0	Peter and the others had fallen asleep . When they woke up , they saw Jesus ' glory and the two men standing with him .
42:9:033:0	As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave , Peter , not even knowing what he was saying , blurted out , “ Master , it 's wonderful for us to be here ! Let 's make three shelters as memorials — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
42:9:034:0	But even as he was saying this , a cloud overshadowed them , and terror gripped them as the cloud covered them .
42:9:035:0	Then a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my Son , my Chosen One . Listen to him . ”
42:9:007:1	Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy
42:9:036:0	When the voice finished , Jesus was there alone . They did n't tell anyone at that time what they had seen .
42:9:037:0	The next day , after they had come down the mountain , a large crowd met Jesus .
42:9:038:0	A man in the crowd called out to him , “ Teacher , I beg you to look at my son , my only child .
42:9:039:0	An evil spirit keeps seizing him , making him scream . It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth . It batters him and hardly ever leaves him alone .
42:9:040:0	I begged your disciples to cast out the spirit , but they could n't do it . ”
42:9:041:0	Jesus said , “ You faithless and corrupt people ! How long must I be with you and put up with you ? ” Then he said to the man , “ Bring your son here . ”
42:9:042:0	As the boy came forward , the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into a violent convulsion . But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit and healed the boy . Then he gave him back to his father .
42:9:008:1	Jesus Again Predicts His Death
42:9:043:0	Awe gripped the people as they saw this majestic display of God 's power.While everyone was marveling at everything he was doing , Jesus said to his disciples ,
42:9:044:0	“ Listen to me and remember what I say . The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies . ”
42:9:009:1	The Greatest in the Kingdom
42:9:045:0	But they did n't know what he meant . Its significance was hidden from them , so they could n't understand it , and they were afraid to ask him about it .
42:9:046:0	Then his disciples began arguing about which of them was the greatest .
42:9:047:0	But Jesus knew their thoughts , so he brought a little child to his side .
42:9:010:1	Using the Name of Jesus
42:9:048:0	Then he said to them , “ Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf welcomes me , and anyone who welcomes me also welcomes my Father who sent me . Whoever is the least among you is the greatest . ”
42:9:049:0	John said to Jesus , “ Master , we saw someone using your name to cast out demons , but we told him to stop because he is n't in our group . ”
42:9:011:1	Opposition from Samaritans
42:9:050:0	But Jesus said , “ Do n't stop him ! Anyone who is not against you is for you . ”
42:9:051:0	As the time drew near for him to ascend to heaven , Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem .
42:9:052:0	He sent messengers ahead to a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival .
42:9:053:0	But the people of the village did not welcome Jesus because he was on his way to Jerusalem .
42:9:054:0	When James and John saw this , they said to Jesus , “ Lord , should we call down fire from heaven to burn them up ? ”
42:9:055:0	But Jesus turned and rebuked them .
42:9:012:1	The Cost of Following Jesus
42:9:056:0	So they went on to another village .
42:9:057:0	As they were walking along , someone said to Jesus , “ I will follow you wherever you go . ”
42:9:058:0	But Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens to live in , and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place even to lay his head . ”
42:9:059:0	He said to another person , “ Come , follow me. ” The man agreed , but he said , “ Lord , first let me return home and bury my father . ”
42:9:060:0	But Jesus told him , “ Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead ! Your duty is to go and preach about the Kingdom of God . ”
42:9:061:0	Another said , “ Yes , Lord , I will follow you , but first let me say good-bye to my family . ”
42:9:062:0	But Jesus told him , “ Anyone who puts a hand to the plow and then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God . ”
