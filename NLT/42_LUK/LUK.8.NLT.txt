42:8:001:1	Women Who Followed Jesus
42:8:001:0	Soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages , preaching and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom of God . He took his twelve disciples with him ,
42:8:002:0	along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases . Among them were Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons ;
42:8:002:1	Parable of the Farmer Scattering Seed
42:8:003:0	Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod 's business manager ; Susanna ; and many others who were contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples .
42:8:004:0	One day Jesus told a story in the form of a parable to a large crowd that had gathered from many towns to hear him :
42:8:005:0	“ A farmer went out to plant his seed . As he scattered it across his field , some seed fell on a footpath , where it was stepped on , and the birds ate it .
42:8:006:0	Other seed fell among rocks . It began to grow , but the plant soon wilted and died for lack of moisture .
42:8:007:0	Other seed fell among thorns that grew up with it and choked out the tender plants .
42:8:008:0	Still other seed fell on fertile soil . This seed grew and produced a crop that was a hundred times as much as had been planted ! ” When he had said this , he called out , “ Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand . ”
42:8:009:0	His disciples asked him what this parable meant .
42:8:010:0	He replied , “ You are permitted to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of God . But I use parables to teach the others so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled : ‘ When they look , they wo n't really see.When they hear , they wo n't understand . '
42:8:011:0	“ This is the meaning of the parable : The seed is God 's word .
42:8:012:0	The seeds that fell on the footpath represent those who hear the message , only to have the devil come and take it away from their hearts and prevent them from believing and being saved .
42:8:013:0	The seeds on the rocky soil represent those who hear the message and receive it with joy . But since they do n't have deep roots , they believe for a while , then they fall away when they face temptation .
42:8:014:0	The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message , but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life . And so they never grow into maturity .
42:8:003:1	Parable of the Lamp
42:8:015:0	And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest , good-hearted people who hear God 's word , cling to it , and patiently produce a huge harvest .
42:8:016:0	“ No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed . A lamp is placed on a stand , where its light can be seen by all who enter the house .
42:8:017:0	For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open , and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all .
42:8:004:1	The True Family of Jesus
42:8:018:0	“ So pay attention to how you hear . To those who listen to my teaching , more understanding will be given . But for those who are not listening , even what they think they understand will be taken away from them . ”
42:8:019:0	Then Jesus ' mother and brothers came to see him , but they could n't get to him because of the crowd .
42:8:020:0	Someone told Jesus , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , and they want to see you . ”
42:8:005:1	Jesus Calms the Storm
42:8:021:0	Jesus replied , “ My mother and my brothers are all those who hear God 's word and obey it . ”
42:8:022:0	One day Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let 's cross to the other side of the lake. ” So they got into a boat and started out .
42:8:023:0	As they sailed across , Jesus settled down for a nap . But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake . The boat was filling with water , and they were in real danger .
42:8:024:0	The disciples went and woke him up , shouting , “ Master , Master , we 're going to drown ! ” When Jesus woke up , he rebuked the wind and the raging waves . Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm .
42:8:006:1	Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Man
42:8:025:0	Then he asked them , “ Where is your faith ? ” The disciples were terrified and amazed . “ Who is this man ? ” they asked each other . “ When he gives a command , even the wind and waves obey him ! ”
42:8:026:0	So they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes , across the lake from Galilee .
42:8:027:0	As Jesus was climbing out of the boat , a man who was possessed by demons came out to meet him . For a long time he had been homeless and naked , living in the tombs outside the town .
42:8:028:0	As soon as he saw Jesus , he shrieked and fell down in front of him . Then he screamed , “ Why are you interfering with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? Please , I beg you , do n't torture me ! ”
42:8:029:0	For Jesus had already commanded the evil spirit to come out of him . This spirit had often taken control of the man . Even when he was placed under guard and put in chains and shackles , he simply broke them and rushed out into the wilderness , completely under the demon 's power .
42:8:030:0	Jesus demanded , “ What is your name ? ” “ Legion , ” he replied , for he was filled with many demons .
42:8:031:0	The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit .
42:8:032:0	There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby , and the demons begged him to let them enter into the pigs.So Jesus gave them permission .
42:8:033:0	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs , and the entire herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned .
42:8:034:0	When the herdsmen saw it , they fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside , spreading the news as they ran .
42:8:035:0	People rushed out to see what had happened . A crowd soon gathered around Jesus , and they saw the man who had been freed from the demons . He was sitting at Jesus ' feet , fully clothed and perfectly sane , and they were all afraid .
42:8:036:0	Then those who had seen what happened told the others how the demon-possessed man had been healed .
42:8:037:0	And all the people in the region of the Gerasenes begged Jesus to go away and leave them alone , for a great wave of fear swept over them.So Jesus returned to the boat and left , crossing back to the other side of the lake .
42:8:038:0	The man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him . But Jesus sent him home , saying ,
42:8:007:1	Jesus Heals in Response to Faith
42:8:039:0	“ No , go back to your family , and tell them everything God has done for you. ” So he went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him .
42:8:040:0	On the other side of the lake the crowds welcomed Jesus , because they had been waiting for him .
42:8:041:0	Then a man named Jairus , a leader of the local synagogue , came and fell at Jesus ' feet , pleading with him to come home with him .
42:8:042:0	His only daughter , who was about twelve years old , was dying.As Jesus went with him , he was surrounded by the crowds .
42:8:043:0	A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding , and she could find no cure .
42:8:044:0	Coming up behind Jesus , she touched the fringe of his robe . Immediately , the bleeding stopped .
42:8:045:0	“ Who touched me ? ” Jesus asked.Everyone denied it , and Peter said , “ Master , this whole crowd is pressing up against you . ”
42:8:046:0	But Jesus said , “ Someone deliberately touched me , for I felt healing power go out from me . ”
42:8:047:0	When the woman realized that she could not stay hidden , she began to tremble and fell to her knees in front of him . The whole crowd heard her explain why she had touched him and that she had been immediately healed .
42:8:048:0	“ Daughter , ” he said to her , “ your faith has made you well . Go in peace . ”
42:8:049:0	While he was still speaking to her , a messenger arrived from the home of Jairus , the leader of the synagogue . He told him , “ Your daughter is dead . There 's no use troubling the Teacher now . ”
42:8:050:0	But when Jesus heard what had happened , he said to Jairus , “ Do n't be afraid . Just have faith , and she will be healed . ”
42:8:051:0	When they arrived at the house , Jesus would n't let anyone go in with him except Peter , John , James , and the little girl 's father and mother .
42:8:052:0	The house was filled with people weeping and wailing , but he said , “ Stop the weeping ! She is n't dead ; she 's only asleep . ”
42:8:053:0	But the crowd laughed at him because they all knew she had died .
42:8:054:0	Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice , “ My child , get up ! ”
42:8:055:0	And at that moment her life returned , and she immediately stood up ! Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat .
42:8:056:0	Her parents were overwhelmed , but Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone what had happened .
