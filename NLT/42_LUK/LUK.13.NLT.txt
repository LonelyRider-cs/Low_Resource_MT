42:13:001:1	A Call to Repentance
42:13:001:0	About this time Jesus was informed that Pilate had murdered some people from Galilee as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple .
42:13:002:0	“ Do you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee ? ” Jesus asked . “ Is that why they suffered ?
42:13:003:0	Not at all ! And you will perish , too , unless you repent of your sins and turn to God .
42:13:004:0	And what about the eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them ? Were they the worst sinners in Jerusalem ?
42:13:002:1	Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
42:13:005:0	No , and I tell you again that unless you repent , you will perish , too . ”
42:13:006:0	Then Jesus told this story : “ A man planted a fig tree in his garden and came again and again to see if there was any fruit on it , but he was always disappointed .
42:13:007:0	Finally , he said to his gardener , ‘ I 've waited three years , and there has n't been a single fig ! Cut it down . It 's just taking up space in the garden . '
42:13:008:0	“ The gardener answered , ‘ Sir , give it one more chance . Leave it another year , and I 'll give it special attention and plenty of fertilizer .
42:13:003:1	Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
42:13:009:0	If we get figs next year , fine . If not , then you can cut it down . ' ”
42:13:010:0	One Sabbath day as Jesus was teaching in a synagogue ,
42:13:011:0	he saw a woman who had been crippled by an evil spirit . She had been bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight .
42:13:012:0	When Jesus saw her , he called her over and said , “ Dear woman , you are healed of your sickness ! ”
42:13:013:0	Then he touched her , and instantly she could stand straight . How she praised God !
42:13:014:0	But the leader in charge of the synagogue was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day . “ There are six days of the week for working , ” he said to the crowd . “ Come on those days to be healed , not on the Sabbath . ”
42:13:015:0	But the Lord replied , “ You hypocrites ! Each of you works on the Sabbath day ! Do n't you untie your ox or your donkey from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it out for water ?
42:13:016:0	This dear woman , a daughter of Abraham , has been held in bondage by Satan for eighteen years . Is n't it right that she be released , even on the Sabbath ? ”
42:13:004:1	Parable of the Mustard Seed
42:13:017:0	This shamed his enemies , but all the people rejoiced at the wonderful things he did .
42:13:018:0	Then Jesus said , “ What is the Kingdom of God like ? How can I illustrate it ?
42:13:005:1	Parable of the Yeast
42:13:019:0	It is like a tiny mustard seed that a man planted in a garden ; it grows and becomes a tree , and the birds make nests in its branches . ”
42:13:020:0	He also asked , “ What else is the Kingdom of God like ?
42:13:006:1	The Narrow Door
42:13:021:0	It is like the yeast a woman used in making bread . Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour , it permeated every part of the dough . ”
42:13:022:0	Jesus went through the towns and villages , teaching as he went , always pressing on toward Jerusalem .
42:13:023:0	Someone asked him , “ Lord , will only a few be saved ? ” He replied ,
42:13:024:0	“ Work hard to enter the narrow door to God 's Kingdom , for many will try to enter but will fail .
42:13:025:0	When the master of the house has locked the door , it will be too late . You will stand outside knocking and pleading , ‘ Lord , open the door for us ! ' But he will reply , ‘ I do n't know you or where you come from . '
42:13:026:0	Then you will say , ‘ But we ate and drank with you , and you taught in our streets . '
42:13:027:0	And he will reply , ‘ I tell you , I do n't know you or where you come from . Get away from me , all you who do evil . '
42:13:028:0	“ There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , for you will see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God , but you will be thrown out .
42:13:029:0	And people will come from all over the world — from east and west , north and south — to take their places in the Kingdom of God .
42:13:007:1	Jesus Grieves over Jerusalem
42:13:030:0	And note this : Some who seem least important now will be the greatest then , and some who are the greatest now will be least important then . ”
42:13:031:0	At that time some Pharisees said to him , “ Get away from here if you want to live ! Herod Antipas wants to kill you ! ”
42:13:032:0	Jesus replied , “ Go tell that fox that I will keep on casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow ; and the third day I will accomplish my purpose .
42:13:033:0	Yes , today , tomorrow , and the next day I must proceed on my way . For it would n't do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem !
42:13:034:0	“ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the city that kills the prophets and stones God 's messengers ! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings , but you would n't let me .
42:13:035:0	And now , look , your house is abandoned . And you will never see me again until you say , ‘ Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the ! ' ”
