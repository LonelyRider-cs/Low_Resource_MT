42:15:001:1	Parable of the Lost Sheep
42:15:001:0	Tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus teach .
42:15:002:0	This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious law complain that he was associating with such sinful people — even eating with them !
42:15:003:0	So Jesus told them this story :
42:15:004:0	“ If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost , what will he do ? Wo n't he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it ?
42:15:005:0	And when he has found it , he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders .
42:15:006:0	When he arrives , he will call together his friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep . '
42:15:002:1	Parable of the Lost Coin
42:15:007:0	In the same way , there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous and have n't strayed away !
42:15:008:0	“ Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one . Wo n't she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it ?
42:15:009:0	And when she finds it , she will call in her friends and neighbors and say , ‘ Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin . '
42:15:003:1	Parable of the Lost Son
42:15:010:0	In the same way , there is joy in the presence of God 's angels when even one sinner repents . ”
42:15:011:0	To illustrate the point further , Jesus told them this story : “ A man had two sons .
42:15:012:0	The younger son told his father , ‘ I want my share of your estate now before you die . ' So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons .
42:15:013:0	“ A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land , and there he wasted all his money in wild living .
42:15:014:0	About the time his money ran out , a great famine swept over the land , and he began to starve .
42:15:015:0	He persuaded a local farmer to hire him , and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs .
42:15:016:0	The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him . But no one gave him anything .
42:15:017:0	“ When he finally came to his senses , he said to himself , ‘ At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare , and here I am dying of hunger !
42:15:018:0	I will go home to my father and say , “ Father , I have sinned against both heaven and you ,
42:15:019:0	and I am no longer worthy of being called your son . Please take me on as a hired servant . ” '
42:15:020:0	“ So he returned home to his father . And while he was still a long way off , his father saw him coming . Filled with love and compassion , he ran to his son , embraced him , and kissed him .
42:15:021:0	His son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against both heaven and you , and I am no longer worthy of being called your son . '
42:15:022:0	“ But his father said to the servants , ‘ Quick ! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him . Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet .
42:15:023:0	And kill the calf we have been fattening . We must celebrate with a feast ,
42:15:024:0	for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life . He was lost , but now he is found . ' So the party began .
42:15:025:0	“ Meanwhile , the older son was in the fields working . When he returned home , he heard music and dancing in the house ,
42:15:026:0	and he asked one of the servants what was going on .
42:15:027:0	‘ Your brother is back , ' he was told , ‘ and your father has killed the fattened calf . We are celebrating because of his safe return . '
42:15:028:0	“ The older brother was angry and would n't go in . His father came out and begged him ,
42:15:029:0	but he replied , ‘ All these years I 've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to . And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends .
42:15:030:0	Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes , you celebrate by killing the fattened calf ! '
42:15:031:0	“ His father said to him , ‘ Look , dear son , you have always stayed by me , and everything I have is yours .
42:15:032:0	We had to celebrate this happy day . For your brother was dead and has come back to life ! He was lost , but now he is found ! ' ”
