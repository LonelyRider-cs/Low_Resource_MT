42:21:001:1	The Widow 's Offering
42:21:001:0	While Jesus was in the Temple , he watched the rich people dropping their gifts in the collection box .
42:21:002:0	Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins .
42:21:003:0	“ I tell you the truth , ” Jesus said , “ this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them .
42:21:002:1	Jesus Speaks about the Future
42:21:004:0	For they have given a tiny part of their surplus , but she , poor as she is , has given everything she has . ”
42:21:005:0	Some of his disciples began talking about the majestic stonework of the Temple and the memorial decorations on the walls . But Jesus said ,
42:21:006:0	“ The time is coming when all these things will be completely demolished . Not one stone will be left on top of another ! ”
42:21:007:0	“ Teacher , ” they asked , “ when will all this happen ? What sign will show us that these things are about to take place ? ”
42:21:008:0	He replied , “ Do n't let anyone mislead you , for many will come in my name , claiming , ‘ I am the Messiah , ' and saying , ‘ The time has come ! ' But do n't believe them .
42:21:009:0	And when you hear of wars and insurrections , do n't panic . Yes , these things must take place first , but the end wo n't follow immediately . ”
42:21:010:0	Then he added , “ Nation will go to war against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42:21:011:0	There will be great earthquakes , and there will be famines and plagues in many lands , and there will be terrifying things and great miraculous signs from heaven .
42:21:012:0	“ But before all this occurs , there will be a time of great persecution . You will be dragged into synagogues and prisons , and you will stand trial before kings and governors because you are my followers .
42:21:013:0	But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me .
42:21:014:0	So do n't worry in advance about how to answer the charges against you ,
42:21:015:0	for I will give you the right words and such wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to reply or refute you !
42:21:016:0	Even those closest to you—your parents , brothers , relatives , and friends—will betray you . They will even kill some of you .
42:21:017:0	And everyone will hate you because you are my followers .
42:21:018:0	But not a hair of your head will perish !
42:21:019:0	By standing firm , you will win your souls .
42:21:020:0	“ And when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived .
42:21:021:0	Then those in Judea must flee to the hills . Those in Jerusalem must get out , and those out in the country should not return to the city .
42:21:022:0	For those will be days of God 's vengeance , and the prophetic words of the Scriptures will be fulfilled .
42:21:023:0	How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days . For there will be disaster in the land and great anger against this people .
42:21:024:0	They will be killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the nations of the world . And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of the Gentiles comes to an end .
42:21:025:0	“ And there will be strange signs in the sun , moon , and stars . And here on earth the nations will be in turmoil , perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides .
42:21:026:0	People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth , for the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
42:21:027:0	Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory .
42:21:028:0	So when all these things begin to happen , stand and look up , for your salvation is near ! ”
42:21:029:0	Then he gave them this illustration : “ Notice the fig tree , or any other tree .
42:21:030:0	When the leaves come out , you know without being told that summer is near .
42:21:031:0	In the same way , when you see all these things taking place , you can know that the Kingdom of God is near .
42:21:032:0	I tell you the truth , this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things have taken place .
42:21:033:0	Heaven and earth will disappear , but my words will never disappear .
42:21:034:0	“ Watch out ! Do n't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness , and by the worries of this life . Do n't let that day catch you unaware ,
42:21:035:0	like a trap . For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth .
42:21:036:0	Keep alert at all times . And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man . ”
42:21:037:0	Every day Jesus went to the Temple to teach , and each evening he returned to spend the night on the Mount of Olives .
42:21:038:0	The crowds gathered at the Temple early each morning to hear him .
