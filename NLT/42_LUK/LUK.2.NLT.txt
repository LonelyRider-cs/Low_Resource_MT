42:2:001:1	The Birth of Jesus
42:2:001:0	At that time the Roman emperor , Augustus , decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire .
42:2:002:0	( This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria . )
42:2:003:0	All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census .
42:2:004:0	And because Joseph was a descendant of King David , he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea , David 's ancient home . He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee .
42:2:005:0	He took with him Mary , to whom he was engaged , who was now expecting a child .
42:2:006:0	And while they were there , the time came for her baby to be born .
42:2:002:1	The Shepherds and Angels
42:2:007:0	She gave birth to her firstborn son . She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger , because there was no lodging available for them .
42:2:008:0	That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby , guarding their flocks of sheep .
42:2:009:0	Suddenly , an angel of the Lord appeared among them , and the radiance of the Lord 's glory surrounded them . They were terrified ,
42:2:010:0	but the angel reassured them . “ Do n't be afraid ! ” he said . “ I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people .
42:2:011:0	The Savior—yes , the Messiah , the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem , the city of David !
42:2:012:0	And you will recognize him by this sign : You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth , lying in a manger . ”
42:2:013:0	Suddenly , the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying ,
42:2:014:0	“ Glory to God in highest heaven , and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased . ”
42:2:015:0	When the angels had returned to heaven , the shepherds said to each other , “ Let 's go to Bethlehem ! Let 's see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has told us about . ”
42:2:016:0	They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph . And there was the baby , lying in the manger .
42:2:017:0	After seeing him , the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child .
42:2:018:0	All who heard the shepherds ' story were astonished ,
42:2:019:0	but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often .
42:2:003:1	Jesus Is Presented in the Temple
42:2:020:0	The shepherds went back to their flocks , glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen . It was just as the angel had told them .
42:2:021:0	Eight days later , when the baby was circumcised , he was named Jesus , the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived .
42:2:022:0	Then it was time for their purification offering , as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child ; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord .
42:2:023:0	The law of the Lord says , “ If a woman 's first child is a boy , he must be dedicated to the Lord . ”
42:2:004:1	The Prophecy of Simeon
42:2:024:0	So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord— “ either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons . ”
42:2:025:0	At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon . He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel . The Holy Spirit was upon him
42:2:026:0	and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord 's Messiah .
42:2:027:0	That day the Spirit led him to the Temple . So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required ,
42:2:028:0	Simeon was there . He took the child in his arms and praised God , saying ,
42:2:029:0	“ Sovereign Lord , now let your servant die in peace , as you have promised .
42:2:030:0	I have seen your salvation ,
42:2:031:0	which you have prepared for all people .
42:2:032:0	He is a light to reveal God to the nations , and he is the glory of your people Israel ! ”
42:2:033:0	Jesus ' parents were amazed at what was being said about him .
42:2:034:0	Then Simeon blessed them , and he said to Mary , the baby 's mother , “ This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall , and many others to rise . He has been sent as a sign from God , but many will oppose him .
42:2:005:1	The Prophecy of Anna
42:2:035:0	As a result , the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed . And a sword will pierce your very soul . ”
42:2:036:0	Anna , a prophet , was also there in the Temple . She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher , and she was very old . Her husband died when they had been married only seven years .
42:2:037:0	Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four . She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night , worshiping God with fasting and prayer .
42:2:038:0	She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph , and she began praising God . She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem .
42:2:039:0	When Jesus ' parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord , they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee .
42:2:006:1	Jesus Speaks with the Teachers
42:2:040:0	There the child grew up healthy and strong . He was filled with wisdom , and God 's favor was on him .
42:2:041:0	Every year Jesus ' parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival .
42:2:042:0	When Jesus was twelve years old , they attended the festival as usual .
42:2:043:0	After the celebration was over , they started home to Nazareth , but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did n't miss him at first ,
42:2:044:0	because they assumed he was among the other travelers . But when he did n't show up that evening , they started looking for him among their relatives and friends .
42:2:045:0	When they could n't find him , they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there .
42:2:046:0	Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple , sitting among the religious teachers , listening to them and asking questions .
42:2:047:0	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
42:2:048:0	His parents did n't know what to think . “ Son , ” his mother said to him , “ why have you done this to us ? Your father and I have been frantic , searching for you everywhere . ”
42:2:049:0	“ But why did you need to search ? ” he asked . “ Did n't you know that I must be in my Father 's house ? ”
42:2:050:0	But they did n't understand what he meant .
42:2:051:0	Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them . And his mother stored all these things in her heart .
42:2:052:0	Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people .
