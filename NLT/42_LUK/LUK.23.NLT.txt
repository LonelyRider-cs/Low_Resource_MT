42:23:001:1	Jesus ' Trial before Pilate
42:23:001:0	Then the entire council took Jesus to Pilate , the Roman governor .
42:23:002:0	They began to state their case : “ This man has been leading our people astray by telling them not to pay their taxes to the Roman government and by claiming he is the Messiah , a king . ”
42:23:003:0	So Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus replied , “ You have said it . ”
42:23:004:0	Pilate turned to the leading priests and to the crowd and said , “ I find nothing wrong with this man ! ”
42:23:005:0	Then they became insistent . “ But he is causing riots by his teaching wherever he goes—all over Judea , from Galilee to Jerusalem ! ”
42:23:006:0	“ Oh , is he a Galilean ? ” Pilate asked .
42:23:007:0	When they said that he was , Pilate sent him to Herod Antipas , because Galilee was under Herod 's jurisdiction , and Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at the time .
42:23:008:0	Herod was delighted at the opportunity to see Jesus , because he had heard about him and had been hoping for a long time to see him perform a miracle .
42:23:009:0	He asked Jesus question after question , but Jesus refused to answer .
42:23:010:0	Meanwhile , the leading priests and the teachers of religious law stood there shouting their accusations .
42:23:011:0	Then Herod and his soldiers began mocking and ridiculing Jesus . Finally , they put a royal robe on him and sent him back to Pilate .
42:23:012:0	( Herod and Pilate , who had been enemies before , became friends that day . )
42:23:013:0	Then Pilate called together the leading priests and other religious leaders , along with the people ,
42:23:014:0	and he announced his verdict . “ You brought this man to me , accusing him of leading a revolt . I have examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and find him innocent .
42:23:015:0	Herod came to the same conclusion and sent him back to us . Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty .
42:23:016:0	So I will have him flogged , and then I will release him . ”
42:23:018:0	Then a mighty roar rose from the crowd , and with one voice they shouted , “ Kill him , and release Barabbas to us ! ”
42:23:019:0	( Barabbas was in prison for taking part in an insurrection in Jerusalem against the government , and for murder . )
42:23:020:0	Pilate argued with them , because he wanted to release Jesus .
42:23:021:0	But they kept shouting , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
42:23:022:0	For the third time he demanded , “ Why ? What crime has he committed ? I have found no reason to sentence him to death . So I will have him flogged , and then I will release him . ”
42:23:023:0	But the mob shouted louder and louder , demanding that Jesus be crucified , and their voices prevailed .
42:23:024:0	So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded .
42:23:002:1	The Crucifixion
42:23:025:0	As they had requested , he released Barabbas , the man in prison for insurrection and murder . But he turned Jesus over to them to do as they wished .
42:23:026:0	As they led Jesus away , a man named Simon , who was from Cyrene , happened to be coming in from the countryside . The soldiers seized him and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus .
42:23:027:0	A large crowd trailed behind , including many grief-stricken women .
42:23:028:0	But Jesus turned and said to them , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do n't weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42:23:029:0	For the days are coming when they will say , ‘ Fortunate indeed are the women who are childless , the wombs that have not borne a child and the breasts that have never nursed . '
42:23:030:0	People will beg the mountains , ‘ Fall on us , ' and plead with the hills , ‘ Bury us . '
42:23:031:0	For if these things are done when the tree is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ”
42:23:032:0	Two others , both criminals , were led out to be executed with him .
42:23:033:0	When they came to a place called The Skull , they nailed him to the cross . And the criminals were also crucified—one on his right and one on his left .
42:23:034:0	Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , for they do n't know what they are doing. ” And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice .
42:23:035:0	The crowd watched and the leaders scoffed . “ He saved others , ” they said , “ let him save himself if he is really God 's Messiah , the Chosen One . ”
42:23:036:0	The soldiers mocked him , too , by offering him a drink of sour wine .
42:23:037:0	They called out to him , “ If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
42:23:038:0	A sign was fastened above him with these words : “ This is the King of the Jews . ”
42:23:039:0	One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed , “ So you 're the Messiah , are you ? Prove it by saving yourself—and us , too , while you 're at it ! ”
42:23:040:0	But the other criminal protested , “ Do n't you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die ?
42:23:041:0	We deserve to die for our crimes , but this man has n't done anything wrong . ”
42:23:042:0	Then he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come into your Kingdom . ”
42:23:003:1	The Death of Jesus
42:23:043:0	And Jesus replied , “ I assure you , today you will be with me in paradise . ”
42:23:044:0	By this time it was about noon , and darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock .
42:23:045:0	The light from the sun was gone . And suddenly , the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn down the middle .
42:23:046:0	Then Jesus shouted , “ Father , I entrust my spirit into your hands ! ” And with those words he breathed his last .
42:23:047:0	When the Roman officer overseeing the execution saw what had happened , he worshiped God and said , “ Surely this man was innocent . ”
42:23:048:0	And when all the crowd that came to see the crucifixion saw what had happened , they went home in deep sorrow .
42:23:004:1	The Burial of Jesus
42:23:049:0	But Jesus ' friends , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance watching .
42:23:050:0	Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph . He was a member of the Jewish high council ,
42:23:051:0	but he had not agreed with the decision and actions of the other religious leaders . He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea , and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come .
42:23:052:0	He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus ' body .
42:23:053:0	Then he took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in a long sheet of linen cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had been carved out of rock .
42:23:054:0	This was done late on Friday afternoon , the day of preparation , as the Sabbath was about to begin .
42:23:055:0	As his body was taken away , the women from Galilee followed and saw the tomb where his body was placed .
42:23:056:0	Then they went home and prepared spices and ointments to anoint his body . But by the time they were finished the Sabbath had begun , so they rested as required by the law .
