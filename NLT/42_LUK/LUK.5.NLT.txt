42:5:001:1	The First Disciples
42:5:001:0	One day as Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee , great crowds pressed in on him to listen to the word of God .
42:5:002:0	He noticed two empty boats at the water 's edge , for the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets .
42:5:003:0	Stepping into one of the boats , Jesus asked Simon , its owner , to push it out into the water . So he sat in the boat and taught the crowds from there .
42:5:004:0	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Now go out where it is deeper , and let down your nets to catch some fish . ”
42:5:005:0	“ Master , ” Simon replied , “ we worked hard all last night and did n't catch a thing . But if you say so , I 'll let the nets down again . ”
42:5:006:0	And this time their nets were so full of fish they began to tear !
42:5:007:0	A shout for help brought their partners in the other boat , and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking .
42:5:008:0	When Simon Peter realized what had happened , he fell to his knees before Jesus and said , “ Oh , Lord , please leave me — I 'm such a sinful man . ”
42:5:009:0	For he was awestruck by the number of fish they had caught , as were the others with him .
42:5:010:0	His partners , James and John , the sons of Zebedee , were also amazed.Jesus replied to Simon , “ Do n't be afraid ! From now on you 'll be fishing for people ! ”
42:5:002:1	Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy
42:5:011:0	And as soon as they landed , they left everything and followed Jesus .
42:5:012:0	In one of the villages , Jesus met a man with an advanced case of leprosy . When the man saw Jesus , he bowed with his face to the ground , begging to be healed . “ Lord , ” he said , “ if you are willing , you can heal me and make me clean . ”
42:5:013:0	Jesus reached out and touched him . “ I am willing , ” he said . “ Be healed ! ” And instantly the leprosy disappeared .
42:5:014:0	Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone what had happened . He said , “ Go to the priest and let him examine you . Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy . This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed . ”
42:5:015:0	But despite Jesus ' instructions , the report of his power spread even faster , and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases .
42:5:003:1	Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man
42:5:016:0	But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer .
42:5:017:0	One day while Jesus was teaching , some Pharisees and teachers of religious law were sitting nearby . ( It seemed that these men showed up from every village in all Galilee and Judea , as well as from Jerusalem . ) And the Lord 's healing power was strongly with Jesus .
42:5:018:0	Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a sleeping mat . They tried to take him inside to Jesus ,
42:5:019:0	but they could n't reach him because of the crowd . So they went up to the roof and took off some tiles . Then they lowered the sick man on his mat down into the crowd , right in front of Jesus .
42:5:020:0	Seeing their faith , Jesus said to the man , “ Young man , your sins are forgiven . ”
42:5:021:0	But the Pharisees and teachers of religious law said to themselves , “ Who does he think he is ? That 's blasphemy ! Only God can forgive sins ! ”
42:5:022:0	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he asked them , “ Why do you question this in your hearts ?
42:5:023:0	Is it easier to say ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ' or ‘ Stand up and walk ' ?
42:5:024:0	So I will prove to you that the Son of Man has the authority on earth to forgive sins. ” Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said , “ Stand up , pick up your mat , and go home ! ”
42:5:025:0	And immediately , as everyone watched , the man jumped up , picked up his mat , and went home praising God .
42:5:004:1	Jesus Calls Levi ( Matthew )
42:5:026:0	Everyone was gripped with great wonder and awe , and they praised God , exclaiming , “ We have seen amazing things today ! ”
42:5:027:0	Later , as Jesus left the town , he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector 's booth . “ Follow me and be my disciple , ” Jesus said to him .
42:5:028:0	So Levi got up , left everything , and followed him .
42:5:029:0	Later , Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor . Many of Levi 's fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them .
42:5:030:0	But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus ' disciples , “ Why do you eat and drink with such scum ? ”
42:5:031:0	Jesus answered them , “ Healthy people do n't need a doctor — sick people do .
42:5:005:1	A Discussion about Fasting
42:5:032:0	I have come to call not those who think they are righteous , but those who know they are sinners and need to repent . ”
42:5:033:0	One day some people said to Jesus , “ John the Baptist 's disciples fast and pray regularly , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees . Why are your disciples always eating and drinking ? ”
42:5:034:0	Jesus responded , “ Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom ? Of course not .
42:5:035:0	But someday the groom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast . ”
42:5:036:0	Then Jesus gave them this illustration : “ No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to patch an old garment . For then the new garment would be ruined , and the new patch would n't even match the old garment .
42:5:037:0	“ And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . For the new wine would burst the wineskins , spilling the wine and ruining the skins .
42:5:038:0	New wine must be stored in new wineskins .
42:5:039:0	But no one who drinks the old wine seems to want the new wine . ‘ The old is just fine , ' they say . ”
