10:12:001:1	Nathan Rebukes David
10:12:001:0	So the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story : “ There were two men in a certain town . One was rich , and one was poor .
10:12:002:0	The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle .
10:12:003:0	The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought . He raised that little lamb , and it grew up with his children . It ate from the man 's own plate and drank from his cup . He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter .
10:12:004:0	One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man . But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd , he took the poor man 's lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest . ”
10:12:005:0	David was furious . “ As surely as the Lord lives , ” he vowed , “ any man who would do such a thing deserves to die !
10:12:006:0	He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity . ”
10:12:007:0	Then Nathan said to David , “ You are that man ! The Lord , the God of Israel , says : I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul .
10:12:008:0	I gave you your master 's house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . And if that had not been enough , I would have given you much , much more .
10:12:009:0	Why , then , have you despised the word of the Lord and done this horrible deed ? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife .
10:12:010:0	From this time on , your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah 's wife to be your own .
10:12:011:0	“ This is what the Lord says : Because of what you have done , I will cause your own household to rebel against you . I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes , and he will go to bed with them in public view .
10:12:002:1	David Confesses His Guilt
10:12:012:0	You did it secretly , but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel . ”
10:12:013:0	Then David confessed to Nathan , “ I have sinned against the Lord. ” Nathan replied , “ Yes , but the Lord has forgiven you , and you wo n't die for this sin .
10:12:014:0	Nevertheless , because you have shown utter contempt for the word of the Lord by doing this , your child will die . ”
10:12:015:0	After Nathan returned to his home , the Lord sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah 's wife .
10:12:016:0	David begged God to spare the child . He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground .
10:12:017:0	The elders of his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them , but he refused .
10:12:018:0	Then on the seventh day the child died . David 's advisers were afraid to tell him . “ He would n't listen to reason while the child was ill , ” they said . “ What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the child is dead ? ”
10:12:019:0	When David saw them whispering , he realized what had happened . “ Is the child dead ? ” he asked. “ Yes , ” they replied , “ he is dead . ”
10:12:020:0	Then David got up from the ground , washed himself , put on lotions , and changed his clothes . He went to the Tabernacle and worshiped the Lord . After that , he returned to the palace and was served food and ate .
10:12:021:0	His advisers were amazed . “ We do n't understand you , ” they told him . “ While the child was still living , you wept and refused to eat . But now that the child is dead , you have stopped your mourning and are eating again . ”
10:12:022:0	David replied , “ I fasted and wept while the child was alive , for I said , ‘ Perhaps the Lord will be gracious to me and let the child live . '
10:12:023:0	But why should I fast when he is dead ? Can I bring him back again ? I will go to him one day , but he can not return to me . ”
10:12:024:0	Then David comforted Bathsheba , his wife , and slept with her . She became pregnant and gave birth to a son , and David named him Solomon . The Lord loved the child
10:12:003:1	David Captures Rabbah
10:12:025:0	and sent word through Nathan the prophet that they should name him Jedidiah ( which means “ beloved of the Lord ” ) , as the Lord had commanded .
10:12:026:0	Meanwhile , Joab was fighting against Rabbah , the capital of Ammon , and he captured the royal fortifications .
10:12:027:0	Joab sent messengers to tell David , “ I have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply .
10:12:028:0	Now bring the rest of the army and capture the city . Otherwise , I will capture it and get credit for the victory . ”
10:12:029:0	So David gathered the rest of the army and went to Rabbah , and he fought against it and captured it .
10:12:030:0	David removed the crown from the king 's head , and it was placed on his own head . The crown was made of gold and set with gems , and it weighed seventy-five pounds . David took a vast amount of plunder from the city .
10:12:031:0	He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with saws , iron picks , and iron axes , and to work in the brick kilns . That is how he dealt with the people of all the Ammonite towns . Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem .
