10:14:001:1	Joab Arranges for Absalom 's Return
10:14:001:0	Joab realized how much the king longed to see Absalom .
10:14:002:0	So he sent for a woman from Tekoa who had a reputation for great wisdom . He said to her , “ Pretend you are in mourning ; wear mourning clothes and do n't put on lotions . Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time .
10:14:003:0	Then go to the king and tell him the story I am about to tell you. ” Then Joab told her what to say .
10:14:004:0	When the woman from Tekoa approached the king , she bowed with her face to the ground in deep respect and cried out , “ O king ! Help me ! ”
10:14:005:0	“ What 's the trouble ? ” the king asked. “ Alas , I am a widow ! ” she replied . “ My husband is dead .
10:14:006:0	My two sons had a fight out in the field . And since no one was there to stop it , one of them was killed .
10:14:007:0	Now the rest of the family is demanding , ‘ Let us have your son . We will execute him for murdering his brother . He does n't deserve to inherit his family 's property . ' They want to extinguish the only coal I have left , and my husband 's name and family will disappear from the face of the earth . ”
10:14:008:0	“ Leave it to me , ” the king told her . “ Go home , and I 'll see to it that no one touches him . ”
10:14:009:0	“ Oh , thank you , my lord the king , ” the woman from Tekoa replied . “ If you are criticized for helping me , let the blame fall on me and on my father 's house , and let the king and his throne be innocent . ”
10:14:010:0	“ If anyone objects , ” the king said , “ bring him to me . I can assure you he will never harm you again ! ”
10:14:011:0	Then she said , “ Please swear to me by the Lord your God that you wo n't let anyone take vengeance against my son . I want no more bloodshed. ” “ As surely as the Lord lives , ” he replied , “ not a hair on your son 's head will be disturbed ! ”
10:14:012:0	“ Please allow me to ask one more thing of my lord the king , ” she said. “ Go ahead and speak , ” he responded .
10:14:013:0	She replied , “ Why do n't you do as much for the people of God as you have promised to do for me ? You have convicted yourself in making this decision , because you have refused to bring home your own banished son .
10:14:014:0	All of us must die eventually . Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground , which can not be gathered up again . But God does not just sweep life away ; instead , he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him .
10:14:015:0	“ I have come to plead with my lord the king because people have threatened me . I said to myself , ‘ Perhaps the king will listen to me
10:14:016:0	and rescue us from those who would cut us off from the inheritance God has given us .
10:14:017:0	Yes , my lord the king will give us peace of mind again . ' I know that you are like an angel of God in discerning good from evil . May the Lord your God be with you . ”
10:14:018:0	“ I must know one thing , ” the king replied , “ and tell me the truth. ” “ Yes , my lord the king , ” she responded .
10:14:019:0	“ Did Joab put you up to this ? ” And the woman replied , “ My lord the king , how can I deny it ? Nobody can hide anything from you . Yes , Joab sent me and told me what to say .
10:14:020:0	He did it to place the matter before you in a different light . But you are as wise as an angel of God , and you understand everything that happens among us ! ”
10:14:021:0	So the king sent for Joab and told him , “ All right , go and bring back the young man Absalom . ”
10:14:022:0	Joab bowed with his face to the ground in deep respect and said , “ At last I know that I have gained your approval , my lord the king , for you have granted me this request ! ”
10:14:023:0	Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem .
10:14:002:1	Absalom Reconciled to David
10:14:024:0	But the king gave this order : “ Absalom may go to his own house , but he must never come into my presence. ” So Absalom did not see the king .
10:14:025:0	Now Absalom was praised as the most handsome man in all Israel . He was flawless from head to foot .
10:14:026:0	He cut his hair only once a year , and then only because it was so heavy . When he weighed it out , it came to five pounds !
10:14:027:0	He had three sons and one daughter . His daughter 's name was Tamar , and she was very beautiful .
10:14:028:0	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years , but he never got to see the king .
10:14:029:0	Then Absalom sent for Joab to ask him to intercede for him , but Joab refused to come . Absalom sent for him a second time , but again Joab refused to come .
10:14:030:0	So Absalom said to his servants , “ Go and set fire to Joab 's barley field , the field next to mine. ” So they set his field on fire , as Absalom had commanded .
10:14:031:0	Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and demanded , “ Why did your servants set my field on fire ? ”
10:14:032:0	And Absalom replied , “ Because I wanted you to ask the king why he brought me back from Geshur if he did n't intend to see me . I might as well have stayed there . Let me see the king ; if he finds me guilty of anything , then let him kill me . ”
10:14:033:0	So Joab told the king what Absalom had said . Then at last David summoned Absalom , who came and bowed low before the king , and the king kissed him .
