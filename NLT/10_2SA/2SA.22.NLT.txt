10:22:001:1	David 's Song of Praise
10:22:001:0	David sang this song to the Lord on the day the Lord rescued him from all his enemies and from Saul .
10:22:002:0	He sang : “ The Lord is my rock , my fortress , and my savior ;
10:22:003:0	my God is my rock , in whom I find protection.He is my shield , the power that saves me , and my place of safety.He is my refuge , my savior , the one who saves me from violence .
10:22:004:0	I called on the Lord , who is worthy of praise , and he saved me from my enemies .
10:22:005:0	“ The waves of death overwhelmed me ; floods of destruction swept over me .
10:22:006:0	The grave wrapped its ropes around me ; death laid a trap in my path .
10:22:007:0	But in my distress I cried out to the Lord ; yes , I cried to my God for help.He heard me from his sanctuary ; my cry reached his ears .
10:22:008:0	“ Then the earth quaked and trembled.The foundations of the heavens shook ; they quaked because of his anger .
10:22:009:0	Smoke poured from his nostrils ; fierce flames leaped from his mouth.Glowing coals blazed forth from him .
10:22:010:0	He opened the heavens and came down ; dark storm clouds were beneath his feet .
10:22:011:0	Mounted on a mighty angelic being , he flew , soaring on the wings of the wind .
10:22:012:0	He shrouded himself in darkness , veiling his approach with dense rain clouds .
10:22:013:0	A great brightness shone around him , and burning coals blazed forth .
10:22:014:0	The Lord thundered from heaven ; the voice of the Most High resounded .
10:22:015:0	He shot arrows and scattered his enemies ; his lightning flashed , and they were confused .
10:22:016:0	Then at the command of the Lord , at the blast of his breath , the bottom of the sea could be seen , and the foundations of the earth were laid bare .
10:22:017:0	“ He reached down from heaven and rescued me ; he drew me out of deep waters .
10:22:018:0	He rescued me from my powerful enemies , from those who hated me and were too strong for me .
10:22:019:0	They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress , but the Lord supported me .
10:22:020:0	He led me to a place of safety ; he rescued me because he delights in me .
10:22:021:0	The Lord rewarded me for doing right ; he restored me because of my innocence .
10:22:022:0	For I have kept the ways of the Lord ; I have not turned from my God to follow evil .
10:22:023:0	I have followed all his regulations ; I have never abandoned his decrees .
10:22:024:0	I am blameless before God ; I have kept myself from sin .
10:22:025:0	The Lord rewarded me for doing right.He has seen my innocence .
10:22:026:0	“ To the faithful you show yourself faithful ; to those with integrity you show integrity .
10:22:027:0	To the pure you show yourself pure , but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd .
10:22:028:0	You rescue the humble , but your eyes watch the proud and humiliate them .
10:22:029:0	O Lord , you are my lamp.The Lord lights up my darkness .
10:22:030:0	In your strength I can crush an army ; with my God I can scale any wall .
10:22:031:0	“ God 's way is perfect.All the Lord 's promises prove true.He is a shield for all who look to him for protection .
10:22:032:0	For who is God except the Lord ? Who but our God is a solid rock ?
10:22:033:0	God is my strong fortress , and he makes my way perfect .
10:22:034:0	He makes me as surefooted as a deer , enabling me to stand on mountain heights .
10:22:035:0	He trains my hands for battle ; he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow .
10:22:036:0	You have given me your shield of victory ; your help has made me great .
10:22:037:0	You have made a wide path for my feetto keep them from slipping .
10:22:038:0	“ I chased my enemies and destroyed them ; I did not stop until they were conquered .
10:22:039:0	I consumed them ; I struck them down so they did not get up ; they fell beneath my feet .
10:22:040:0	You have armed me with strength for the battle ; you have subdued my enemies under my feet .
10:22:041:0	You placed my foot on their necks.I have destroyed all who hated me .
10:22:042:0	They looked for help , but no one came to their rescue.They even cried to the Lord , but he refused to answer .
10:22:043:0	I ground them as fine as the dust of the earth ; I trampled them in the gutter like dirt .
10:22:044:0	“ You gave me victory over my accusers.You preserved me as the ruler over nations ; people I do n't even know now serve me .
10:22:045:0	Foreign nations cringe before me ; as soon as they hear of me , they submit .
10:22:046:0	They all lose their courageand come trembling from their strongholds .
10:22:047:0	“ The Lord lives ! Praise to my Rock ! May God , the Rock of my salvation , be exalted !
10:22:048:0	He is the God who pays back those who harm me ; he brings down the nations under me
10:22:049:0	and delivers me from my enemies.You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies ; you save me from violent opponents .
10:22:050:0	For this , O Lord , I will praise you among the nations ; I will sing praises to your name .
10:22:051:0	You give great victories to your king ; you show unfailing love to your anointed , to David and all his descendants forever . ”
