10:18:001:1	Absalom 's Defeat and Death
10:18:001:0	David now mustered the men who were with him and appointed generals and captains to lead them .
10:18:002:0	He sent the troops out in three groups , placing one group under Joab , one under Joab 's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah , and one under Ittai , the man from Gath . The king told his troops , “ I am going out with you . ”
10:18:003:0	But his men objected strongly . “ You must not go , ” they urged . “ If we have to turn and run—and even if half of us die—it will make no difference to Absalom 's troops ; they will be looking only for you . You are worth 10,000 of us , and it is better that you stay here in the town and send help if we need it . ”
10:18:004:0	“ If you think that 's the best plan , I 'll do it , ” the king answered . So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands .
10:18:005:0	And the king gave this command to Joab , Abishai , and Ittai : “ For my sake , deal gently with young Absalom. ” And all the troops heard the king give this order to his commanders .
10:18:006:0	So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim ,
10:18:007:0	and the Israelite troops were beaten back by David 's men . There was a great slaughter that day , and 20,000 men laid down their lives .
10:18:008:0	The battle raged all across the countryside , and more men died because of the forest than were killed by the sword .
10:18:009:0	During the battle , Absalom happened to come upon some of David 's men . He tried to escape on his mule , but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree , his hair got caught in the tree . His mule kept going and left him dangling in the air .
10:18:010:0	One of David 's men saw what had happened and told Joab , “ I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree . ”
10:18:011:0	“ What ? ” Joab demanded . “ You saw him there and did n't kill him ? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver and a hero 's belt ! ”
10:18:012:0	“ I would not kill the king 's son for even a thousand pieces of silver , ” the man replied to Joab . “ We all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai , ‘ For my sake , please spare young Absalom . '
10:18:013:0	And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son—and the king would certainly find out who did it—you yourself would be the first to abandon me . ”
10:18:014:0	“ Enough of this nonsense , ” Joab said . Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom 's heart as he dangled , still alive , in the great tree .
10:18:015:0	Ten of Joab 's young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him .
10:18:016:0	Then Joab blew the ram 's horn , and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel .
10:18:017:0	They threw Absalom 's body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it . And all Israel fled to their homes .
10:18:002:1	David Mourns Absalom 's Death
10:18:018:0	During his lifetime , Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King 's Valley , for he said , “ I have no son to carry on my name. ” He named the monument after himself , and it is known as Absalom 's Monument to this day .
10:18:019:0	Then Zadok 's son Ahimaaz said , “ Let me run to the king with the good news that the Lord has rescued him from his enemies . ”
10:18:020:0	“ No , ” Joab told him , “ it would n't be good news to the king that his son is dead . You can be my messenger another time , but not today . ”
10:18:021:0	Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia , “ Go tell the king what you have seen. ” The man bowed and ran off .
10:18:022:0	But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab , “ Whatever happens , please let me go , too. ” “ Why should you go , my son ? ” Joab replied . “ There will be no reward for your news . ”
10:18:023:0	“ Yes , but let me go anyway , ” he begged.Joab finally said , “ All right , go ahead. ” So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian .
10:18:024:0	While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town , the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall . As he looked , he saw a lone man running toward them .
10:18:025:0	He shouted the news down to David , and the king replied , “ If he is alone , he has news. ” As the messenger came closer ,
10:18:026:0	the watchman saw another man running toward them . He shouted down , “ Here comes another one ! ” The king replied , “ He also will have news . ”
10:18:027:0	“ The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok , ” the watchman said. “ He is a good man and comes with good news , ” the king replied .
10:18:028:0	Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king , “ Everything is all right ! ” He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said , “ Praise to the Lord your God , who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king . ”
10:18:029:0	“ What about young Absalom ? ” the king demanded . “ Is he all right ? ” Ahimaaz replied , “ When Joab told me to come , there was a lot of commotion . But I did n't know what was happening . ”
10:18:030:0	“ Wait here , ” the king told him . So Ahimaaz stepped aside .
10:18:031:0	Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said , “ I have good news for my lord the king . Today the Lord has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you . ”
10:18:032:0	“ What about young Absalom ? ” the king demanded . “ Is he all right ? ” And the Ethiopian replied , “ May all of your enemies , my lord the king , both now and in the future , share the fate of that young man ! ”
10:18:033:0	The king was overcome with emotion . He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears . And as he went , he cried , “ O my son Absalom ! My son , my son Absalom ! If only I had died instead of you ! O Absalom , my son , my son . ”
