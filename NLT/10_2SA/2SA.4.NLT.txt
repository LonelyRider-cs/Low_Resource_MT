10:4:001:1	The Murder of Ishbosheth
10:4:001:0	When Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , heard about Abner 's death at Hebron , he lost all courage , and all Israel became paralyzed with fear .
10:4:002:0	Now there were two brothers , Baanah and Recab , who were captains of Ishbosheth 's raiding parties . They were sons of Rimmon , a member of the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Beeroth . The town of Beeroth is now part of Benjamin 's territory
10:4:003:0	because the original people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim , where they still live as foreigners .
10:4:004:0	( Saul 's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth , who was crippled as a child . He was five years old when the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had been killed in battle . When the child 's nurse heard the news , she picked him up and fled . But as she hurried away , she dropped him , and he became crippled . )
10:4:005:0	One day Recab and Baanah , the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth , went to Ishbosheth 's house around noon as he was taking his midday rest .
10:4:006:0	The doorkeeper , who had been sifting wheat , became drowsy and fell asleep . So Recab and Baanah slipped past her .
10:4:007:0	They went into the house and found Ishbosheth sleeping on his bed . They struck and killed him and cut off his head . Then , taking his head with them , they fled across the Jordan Valley through the night .
10:4:008:0	When they arrived at Hebron , they presented Ishbosheth 's head to David . “ Look ! ” they exclaimed to the king . “ Here is the head of Ishbosheth , the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you . Today the Lord has given my lord the king revenge on Saul and his entire family ! ”
10:4:009:0	But David said to Recab and Baanah , “ The Lord , who saves me from all my enemies , is my witness .
10:4:010:0	Someone once told me , ‘ Saul is dead , ' thinking he was bringing me good news . But I seized him and killed him at Ziklag . That 's the reward I gave him for his news !
10:4:011:0	How much more should I reward evil men who have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed ? Should n't I hold you responsible for his blood and rid the earth of you ? ”
10:4:012:0	So David ordered his young men to kill them , and they did . They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies beside the pool in Hebron . Then they took Ishbosheth 's head and buried it in Abner 's tomb in Hebron .
