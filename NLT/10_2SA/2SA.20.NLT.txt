10:20:001:1	The Revolt of Sheba
10:20:001:0	There happened to be a troublemaker there named Sheba son of Bicri , a man from the tribe of Benjamin . Sheba blew a ram 's horn and began to chant : “ Down with the dynasty of David ! We have no interest in the son of Jesse.Come on , you men of Israel , back to your homes ! ”
10:20:002:0	So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bicri . But the men of Judah stayed with their king and escorted him from the Jordan River to Jerusalem .
10:20:003:0	When David came to his palace in Jerusalem , he took the ten concubines he had left to look after the palace and placed them in seclusion . Their needs were provided for , but he no longer slept with them . So each of them lived like a widow until she died .
10:20:004:0	Then the king told Amasa , “ Mobilize the army of Judah within three days , and report back at that time . ”
10:20:005:0	So Amasa went out to notify Judah , but it took him longer than the time he had been given .
10:20:006:0	Then David said to Abishai , “ Sheba son of Bicri is going to hurt us more than Absalom did . Quick , take my troops and chase after him before he gets into a fortified town where we ca n't reach him . ”
10:20:007:0	So Abishai and Joab , together with the king 's bodyguard and all the mighty warriors , set out from Jerusalem to go after Sheba .
10:20:008:0	As they arrived at the great stone in Gibeon , Amasa met them . Joab was wearing his military tunic with a dagger strapped to his belt . As he stepped forward to greet Amasa , he slipped the dagger from its sheath .
10:20:009:0	“ How are you , my cousin ? ” Joab said and took him by the beard with his right hand as though to kiss him .
10:20:010:0	Amasa did n't notice the dagger in his left hand , and Joab stabbed him in the stomach with it so that his insides gushed out onto the ground . Joab did not need to strike again , and Amasa soon died . Joab and his brother Abishai left him lying there and continued after Sheba .
10:20:011:0	One of Joab 's young men shouted to Amasa 's troops , “ If you are for Joab and David , come and follow Joab . ”
10:20:012:0	But Amasa lay in his blood in the middle of the road , and Joab 's man saw that everyone was stopping to stare at him . So he pulled him off the road into a field and threw a cloak over him .
10:20:013:0	With Amasa 's body out of the way , everyone went on with Joab to capture Sheba son of Bicri .
10:20:014:0	Meanwhile , Sheba traveled through all the tribes of Israel and eventually came to the town of Abel-beth-maacah . All the members of his own clan , the Bicrites , assembled for battle and followed him into the town .
10:20:015:0	When Joab 's forces arrived , they attacked Abel-beth-maacah . They built a siege ramp against the town 's fortifications and began battering down the wall .
10:20:016:0	But a wise woman in the town called out to Joab , “ Listen to me , Joab . Come over here so I can talk to you . ”
10:20:017:0	As he approached , the woman asked , “ Are you Joab ? ” “ I am , ” he replied.So she said , “ Listen carefully to your servant. ” “ I 'm listening , ” he said .
10:20:018:0	Then she continued , “ There used to be a saying , ‘ If you want to settle an argument , ask advice at the town of Abel . '
10:20:019:0	I am one who is peace loving and faithful in Israel . But you are destroying an important town in Israel . Why do you want to devour what belongs to the Lord ? ”
10:20:020:0	And Joab replied , “ Believe me , I do n't want to devour or destroy your town !
10:20:021:0	That 's not my purpose . All I want is a man named Sheba son of Bicri from the hill country of Ephraim , who has revolted against King David . If you hand over this one man to me , I will leave the town in peace. ” “ All right , ” the woman replied , “ we will throw his head over the wall to you . ”
10:20:022:0	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice , and they cut off Sheba 's head and threw it out to Joab . So he blew the ram 's horn and called his troops back from the attack . They all returned to their homes , and Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem .
10:20:023:0	Now Joab was the commander of the army of Israel . Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king 's bodyguard .
10:20:024:0	Adoniram was in charge of forced labor . Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian .
10:20:025:0	Sheva was the court secretary . Zadok and Abiathar were the priests .
10:20:026:0	And Ira , a descendant of Jair , was David 's personal priest .
