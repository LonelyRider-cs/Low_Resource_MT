10:2:001:1	David Anointed King of Judah
10:2:001:0	After this , David asked the Lord , “ Should I move back to one of the towns of Judah ? ” “ Yes , ” the Lord replied.Then David asked , “ Which town should I go to ? ” “ To Hebron , ” the Lord answered .
10:2:002:0	David 's two wives were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail , the widow of Nabal from Carmel . So David and his wives
10:2:003:0	and his men and their families all moved to Judah , and they settled in the villages near Hebron .
10:2:004:0	Then the men of Judah came to David and anointed him king over the people of Judah.When David heard that the men of Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul ,
10:2:005:0	he sent them this message : “ May the Lord bless you for being so loyal to your master Saul and giving him a decent burial .
10:2:006:0	May the Lord be loyal to you in return and reward you with his unfailing love ! And I , too , will reward you for what you have done .
10:2:002:1	Ishbosheth Proclaimed King of Israel
10:2:007:0	Now that Saul is dead , I ask you to be my strong and loyal subjects like the people of Judah , who have anointed me as their new king . ”
10:2:008:0	But Abner son of Ner , the commander of Saul 's army , had already gone to Mahanaim with Saul 's son Ishbosheth .
10:2:009:0	There he proclaimed Ishbosheth king over Gilead , Jezreel , Ephraim , Benjamin , the land of the Ashurites , and all the rest of Israel .
10:2:010:0	Ishbosheth , Saul 's son , was forty years old when he became king , and he ruled from Mahanaim for two years . Meanwhile , the people of Judah remained loyal to David .
10:2:003:1	War between Israel and Judah
10:2:011:0	David made Hebron his capital , and he ruled as king of Judah for seven and a half years .
10:2:012:0	One day Abner led Ishbosheth 's troops from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
10:2:013:0	About the same time , Joab son of Zeruiah led David 's troops out and met them at the pool of Gibeon . The two groups sat down there , facing each other from opposite sides of the pool .
10:2:014:0	Then Abner suggested to Joab , “ Let 's have a few of our warriors fight hand to hand here in front of us. ” “ All right , ” Joab agreed .
10:2:015:0	So twelve men were chosen to fight from each side — twelve men of Benjamin representing Ishbosheth son of Saul , and twelve representing David .
10:2:016:0	Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword into the other 's side so that all of them died . So this place at Gibeon has been known ever since as the Field of Swords .
10:2:004:1	The Death of Asahel
10:2:017:0	A fierce battle followed that day , and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the forces of David .
10:2:018:0	Joab , Abishai , and Asahel — the three sons of Zeruiah — were among David 's forces that day . Asahel could run like a gazelle ,
10:2:019:0	and he began chasing Abner . He pursued him relentlessly , not stopping for anything .
10:2:020:0	When Abner looked back and saw him coming , he called out , “ Is that you , Asahel ? ” “ Yes , it is , ” he replied .
10:2:021:0	“ Go fight someone else ! ” Abner warned . “ Take on one of the younger men , and strip him of his weapons. ” But Asahel kept right on chasing Abner .
10:2:022:0	Again Abner shouted to him , “ Get away from here ! I do n't want to kill you . How could I ever face your brother Joab again ? ”
10:2:023:0	But Asahel refused to turn back , so Abner thrust the butt end of his spear through Asahel 's stomach , and the spear came out through his back . He stumbled to the ground and died there . And everyone who came by that spot stopped and stood still when they saw Asahel lying there .
10:2:024:0	When Joab and Abishai found out what had happened , they set out after Abner . The sun was just going down as they arrived at the hill of Ammah near Giah , along the road to the wilderness of Gibeon .
10:2:025:0	Abner 's troops from the tribe of Benjamin regrouped there at the top of the hill to take a stand .
10:2:026:0	Abner shouted down to Joab , “ Must we always be killing each other ? Do n't you realize that bitterness is the only result ? When will you call off your men from chasing their Israelite brothers ? ”
10:2:027:0	Then Joab said , “ God only knows what would have happened if you had n't spoken , for we would have chased you all night if necessary . ”
10:2:028:0	So Joab blew the ram 's horn , and his men stopped chasing the troops of Israel .
10:2:029:0	All that night Abner and his men retreated through the Jordan Valley . They crossed the Jordan River , traveling all through the morning , and did n't stop until they arrived at Mahanaim .
10:2:030:0	Meanwhile , Joab and his men also returned home . When Joab counted his casualties , he discovered that only 19 men were missing in addition to Asahel .
10:2:031:0	But 360 of Abner 's men had been killed , all from the tribe of Benjamin .
10:2:032:0	Joab and his men took Asahel 's body to Bethlehem and buried him there in his father 's tomb . Then they traveled all night and reached Hebron at daybreak .
