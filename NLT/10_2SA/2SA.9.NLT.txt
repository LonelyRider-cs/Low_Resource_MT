10:9:001:1	David 's Kindness to Mephibosheth
10:9:001:0	One day David asked , “ Is anyone in Saul 's family still alive—anyone to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan 's sake ? ”
10:9:002:0	He summoned a man named Ziba , who had been one of Saul 's servants . “ Are you Ziba ? ” the king asked. “ Yes sir , I am , ” Ziba replied .
10:9:003:0	The king then asked him , “ Is anyone still alive from Saul 's family ? If so , I want to show God 's kindness to them. ” Ziba replied , “ Yes , one of Jonathan 's sons is still alive . He is crippled in both feet . ”
10:9:004:0	“ Where is he ? ” the king asked. “ In Lo-debar , ” Ziba told him , “ at the home of Makir son of Ammiel . ”
10:9:005:0	So David sent for him and brought him from Makir 's home .
10:9:006:0	His name was Mephibosheth ; he was Jonathan 's son and Saul 's grandson . When he came to David , he bowed low to the ground in deep respect . David said , “ Greetings , Mephibosheth. ” Mephibosheth replied , “ I am your servant . ”
10:9:007:0	“ Do n't be afraid ! ” David said . “ I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father , Jonathan . I will give you all the property that once belonged to your grandfather Saul , and you will eat here with me at the king 's table ! ”
10:9:008:0	Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed , “ Who is your servant , that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me ? ”
10:9:009:0	Then the king summoned Saul 's servant Ziba and said , “ I have given your master 's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family .
10:9:010:0	You and your sons and servants are to farm the land for him to produce food for your master 's household . But Mephibosheth , your master 's grandson , will eat here at my table. ” ( Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants . )
10:9:011:0	Ziba replied , “ Yes , my lord the king ; I am your servant , and I will do all that you have commanded. ” And from that time on , Mephibosheth ate regularly at David 's table , like one of the king 's own sons .
10:9:012:0	Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica . From then on , all the members of Ziba 's household were Mephibosheth 's servants .
10:9:013:0	And Mephibosheth , who was crippled in both feet , lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at the king 's table .
