10:6:001:1	Moving the Ark to Jerusalem
10:6:001:0	Then David again gathered all the elite troops in Israel , 30,000 in all .
10:6:002:0	He led them to Baalah of Judah to bring back the Ark of God , which bears the name of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies , who is enthroned between the cherubim .
10:6:003:0	They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab 's house , which was on a hill . Uzzah and Ahio , Abinadab 's sons , were guiding the cart
10:6:004:0	that carried the Ark of God . Ahio walked in front of the Ark .
10:6:005:0	David and all the people of Israel were celebrating before the Lord , singing songs and playing all kinds of musical instruments — lyres , harps , tambourines , castanets , and cymbals .
10:6:006:0	But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon , the oxen stumbled , and Uzzah reached out his hand and steadied the Ark of God .
10:6:007:0	Then the Lord 's anger was aroused against Uzzah , and God struck him dead because of this . So Uzzah died right there beside the Ark of God .
10:6:008:0	David was angry because the Lord 's anger had burst out against Uzzah . He named that place Perez-uzzah ( which means “ to burst out against Uzzah ” ) , as it is still called today .
10:6:009:0	David was now afraid of the Lord , and he asked , “ How can I ever bring the Ark of the Lord back into my care ? ”
10:6:010:0	So David decided not to move the Ark of the Lord into the City of David . Instead , he took it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath .
10:6:011:0	The Ark of the Lord remained there in Obed-edom 's house for three months , and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and his entire household .
10:6:012:0	Then King David was told , “ The Lord has blessed Obed-edom 's household and everything he has because of the Ark of God. ” So David went there and brought the Ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the City of David with a great celebration .
10:6:013:0	After the men who were carrying the Ark of the Lord had gone six steps , David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf .
10:6:014:0	And David danced before the Lord with all his might , wearing a priestly garment .
10:6:002:1	Michal 's Contempt for David
10:6:015:0	So David and all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouts of joy and the blowing of rams ' horns .
10:6:016:0	But as the Ark of the Lord entered the City of David , Michal , the daughter of Saul , looked down from her window . When she saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord , she was filled with contempt for him .
10:6:017:0	They brought the Ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the special tent David had prepared for it . And David sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord .
10:6:018:0	When he had finished his sacrifices , David blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Heaven 's Armies .
10:6:019:0	Then he gave to every Israelite man and woman in the crowd a loaf of bread , a cake of dates , and a cake of raisins . Then all the people returned to their homes .
10:6:020:0	When David returned home to bless his own family , Michal , the daughter of Saul , came out to meet him . She said in disgust , “ How distinguished the king of Israel looked today , shamelessly exposing himself to the servant girls like any vulgar person might do ! ”
10:6:021:0	David retorted to Michal , “ I was dancing before the Lord , who chose me above your father and all his family ! He appointed me as the leader of Israel , the people of the Lord , so I celebrate before the Lord .
10:6:022:0	Yes , and I am willing to look even more foolish than this , even to be humiliated in my own eyes ! But those servant girls you mentioned will indeed think I am distinguished ! ”
10:6:023:0	So Michal , the daughter of Saul , remained childless throughout her entire life .
