10:16:001:1	David and Ziba
10:16:001:0	When David had gone a little beyond the summit of the Mount of Olives , Ziba , the servant of Mephibosheth , was waiting there for him . He had two donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread , 100 clusters of raisins , 100 bunches of summer fruit , and a wineskin full of wine .
10:16:002:0	“ What are these for ? ” the king asked Ziba.Ziba replied , “ The donkeys are for the king 's people to ride on , and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat . The wine is for those who become exhausted in the wilderness . ”
10:16:003:0	“ And where is Mephibosheth , Saul 's grandson ? ” the king asked him. “ He stayed in Jerusalem , ” Ziba replied . “ He said , ‘ Today I will get back the kingdom of my grandfather Saul . ' ”
10:16:002:1	Shimei Curses David
10:16:004:0	“ In that case , ” the king told Ziba , “ I give you everything Mephibosheth owns. ” “ I bow before you , ” Ziba replied . “ May I always be pleasing to you , my lord the king . ”
10:16:005:0	As King David came to Bahurim , a man came out of the village cursing them . It was Shimei son of Gera , from the same clan as Saul 's family .
10:16:006:0	He threw stones at the king and the king 's officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded him .
10:16:007:0	“ Get out of here , you murderer , you scoundrel ! ” he shouted at David .
10:16:008:0	“ The Lord is paying you back for all the bloodshed in Saul 's clan . You stole his throne , and now the Lord has given it to your son Absalom . At last you will taste some of your own medicine , for you are a murderer ! ”
10:16:009:0	“ Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? ” Abishai son of Zeruiah demanded . “ Let me go over and cut off his head ! ”
10:16:010:0	“ No ! ” the king said . “ Who asked your opinion , you sons of Zeruiah ! If the Lord has told him to curse me , who are you to stop him ? ”
10:16:011:0	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants , “ My own son is trying to kill me . Does n't this relative of Saul have even more reason to do so ? Leave him alone and let him curse , for the Lord has told him to do it .
10:16:012:0	And perhaps the Lord will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses today . ”
10:16:013:0	So David and his men continued down the road , and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside , cursing and throwing stones and dirt at David .
10:16:003:1	Ahithophel Advises Absalom
10:16:014:0	The king and all who were with him grew weary along the way , so they rested when they reached the Jordan River .
10:16:015:0	Meanwhile , Absalom and all the army of Israel arrived at Jerusalem , accompanied by Ahithophel .
10:16:016:0	When David 's friend Hushai the Arkite arrived , he went immediately to see Absalom . “ Long live the king ! ” he exclaimed . “ Long live the king ! ”
10:16:017:0	“ Is this the way you treat your friend David ? ” Absalom asked him . “ Why are n't you with him ? ”
10:16:018:0	“ I 'm here because I belong to the man who is chosen by the Lord and by all the men of Israel , ” Hushai replied .
10:16:019:0	“ And anyway , why should n't I serve you ? Just as I was your father 's adviser , now I will be your adviser ! ”
10:16:020:0	Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him , “ What should I do next ? ”
10:16:021:0	Ahithophel told him , “ Go and sleep with your father 's concubines , for he has left them here to look after the palace . Then all Israel will know that you have insulted your father beyond hope of reconciliation , and they will throw their support to you . ”
10:16:022:0	So they set up a tent on the palace roof where everyone could see it , and Absalom went in and had sex with his father 's concubines .
10:16:023:0	Absalom followed Ahithophel 's advice , just as David had done . For every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God .
