10:21:001:1	David Avenges the Gibeonites
10:21:001:0	There was a famine during David 's reign that lasted for three years , so David asked the Lord about it . And the Lord said , “ The famine has come because Saul and his family are guilty of murdering the Gibeonites . ”
10:21:002:0	So the king summoned the Gibeonites . They were not part of Israel but were all that was left of the nation of the Amorites . The people of Israel had sworn not to kill them , but Saul , in his zeal for Israel and Judah , had tried to wipe them out .
10:21:003:0	David asked them , “ What can I do for you ? How can I make amends so that you will bless the Lord 's people again ? ”
10:21:004:0	“ Well , money ca n't settle this matter between us and the family of Saul , ” the Gibeonites replied . “ Neither can we demand the life of anyone in Israel. ” “ What can I do then ? ” David asked . “ Just tell me and I will do it for you . ”
10:21:005:0	Then they replied , “ It was Saul who planned to destroy us , to keep us from having any place at all in the territory of Israel .
10:21:006:0	So let seven of Saul 's sons be handed over to us , and we will execute them before the Lord at Gibeon , on the mountain of the Lord. ” “ All right , ” the king said , “ I will do it . ”
10:21:007:0	The king spared Jonathan 's son Mephibosheth , who was Saul 's grandson , because of the oath David and Jonathan had sworn before the Lord .
10:21:008:0	But he gave them Saul 's two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth , whose mother was Rizpah daughter of Aiah . He also gave them the five sons of Saul 's daughter Merab , the wife of Adriel son of Barzillai from Meholah .
10:21:009:0	The men of Gibeon executed them on the mountain before the Lord . So all seven of them died together at the beginning of the barley harvest .
10:21:010:0	Then Rizpah daughter of Aiah , the mother of two of the men , spread burlap on a rock and stayed there the entire harvest season . She prevented the scavenger birds from tearing at their bodies during the day and stopped wild animals from eating them at night .
10:21:011:0	When David learned what Rizpah , Saul 's concubine , had done ,
10:21:012:0	he went to the people of Jabesh-gilead and retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan . ( When the Philistines had killed Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa , the people of Jabesh-gilead stole their bodies from the public square of Beth-shan , where the Philistines had hung them . )
10:21:013:0	So David obtained the bones of Saul and Jonathan , as well as the bones of the men the Gibeonites had executed .
10:21:002:1	Battles against Philistine Giants
10:21:014:0	Then the king ordered that they bury the bones in the tomb of Kish , Saul 's father , at the town of Zela in the land of Benjamin . After that , God ended the famine in the land .
10:21:015:0	Once again the Philistines were at war with Israel . And when David and his men were in the thick of battle , David became weak and exhausted .
10:21:016:0	Ishbi-benob was a descendant of the giants ; his bronze spearhead weighed more than seven pounds , and he was armed with a new sword . He had cornered David and was about to kill him .
10:21:017:0	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David 's rescue and killed the Philistine . Then David 's men declared , “ You are not going out to battle with us again ! Why risk snuffing out the light of Israel ? ”
10:21:018:0	After this , there was another battle against the Philistines at Gob . As they fought , Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph , another descendant of the giants .
10:21:019:0	During another battle at Gob , Elhanan son of Jair from Bethlehem killed the brother of Goliath of Gath . The handle of his spear was as thick as a weaver 's beam !
10:21:020:0	In another battle with the Philistines at Gath , they encountered a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot , twenty-four in all , who was also a descendant of the giants .
10:21:021:0	But when he defied and taunted Israel , he was killed by Jonathan , the son of David 's brother Shimea .
10:21:022:0	These four Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath , but David and his warriors killed them .
