10:15:001:1	Absalom 's Rebellion
10:15:001:0	After this , Absalom bought a chariot and horses , and he hired fifty bodyguards to run ahead of him .
10:15:002:0	He got up early every morning and went out to the gate of the city . When people brought a case to the king for judgment , Absalom would ask where in Israel they were from , and they would tell him their tribe .
10:15:003:0	Then Absalom would say , “ You 've really got a strong case here ! It 's too bad the king does n't have anyone to hear it .
10:15:004:0	I wish I were the judge . Then everyone could bring their cases to me for judgment , and I would give them justice ! ”
10:15:005:0	When people tried to bow before him , Absalom would n't let them . Instead , he took them by the hand and kissed them .
10:15:006:0	Absalom did this with everyone who came to the king for judgment , and so he stole the hearts of all the people of Israel .
10:15:007:0	After four years , Absalom said to the king , “ Let me go to Hebron to offer a sacrifice to the Lord and fulfill a vow I made to him .
10:15:008:0	For while your servant was at Geshur in Aram , I promised to sacrifice to the Lord in Hebron if he would bring me back to Jerusalem . ”
10:15:009:0	“ All right , ” the king told him . “ Go and fulfill your vow. ” So Absalom went to Hebron .
10:15:010:0	But while he was there , he sent secret messengers to all the tribes of Israel to stir up a rebellion against the king . “ As soon as you hear the ram 's horn , ” his message read , “ you are to say , ‘ Absalom has been crowned king in Hebron . ' ”
10:15:011:0	He took 200 men from Jerusalem with him as guests , but they knew nothing of his intentions .
10:15:002:1	David Escapes from Jerusalem
10:15:012:0	While Absalom was offering the sacrifices , he sent for Ahithophel , one of David 's counselors who lived in Giloh . Soon many others also joined Absalom , and the conspiracy gained momentum .
10:15:013:0	A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell David , “ All Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you ! ”
10:15:014:0	“ Then we must flee at once , or it will be too late ! ” David urged his men . “ Hurry ! If we get out of the city before Absalom arrives , both we and the city of Jerusalem will be spared from disaster . ”
10:15:015:0	“ We are with you , ” his advisers replied . “ Do what you think is best . ”
10:15:016:0	So the king and all his household set out at once . He left no one behind except ten of his concubines to look after the palace .
10:15:017:0	The king and all his people set out on foot , pausing at the last house
10:15:018:0	to let all the king 's men move past to lead the way . There were 600 men from Gath who had come with David , along with the king 's bodyguard .
10:15:019:0	Then the king turned and said to Ittai , a leader of the men from Gath , “ Why are you coming with us ? Go on back to King Absalom , for you are a guest in Israel , a foreigner in exile .
10:15:020:0	You arrived only recently , and should I force you today to wander with us ? I do n't even know where we will go . Go on back and take your kinsmen with you , and may the Lord show you his unfailing love and faithfulness . ”
10:15:021:0	But Ittai said to the king , “ I vow by the Lord and by your own life that I will go wherever my lord the king goes , no matter what happens — whether it means life or death . ”
10:15:022:0	David replied , “ All right , come with us. ” So Ittai and all his men and their families went along .
10:15:023:0	Everyone cried loudly as the king and his followers passed by . They crossed the Kidron Valley and then went out toward the wilderness .
10:15:024:0	Zadok and all the Levites also came along , carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God . They set down the Ark of God , and Abiathar offered sacrifices until everyone had passed out of the city .
10:15:025:0	Then the king instructed Zadok to take the Ark of God back into the city . “ If the Lord sees fit , ” David said , “ he will bring me back to see the Ark and the Tabernacle again .
10:15:026:0	But if he is through with me , then let him do what seems best to him . ”
10:15:027:0	The king also told Zadok the priest , “ Look , here is my plan . You and Abiathar should return quietly to the city with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar 's son Jonathan .
10:15:028:0	I will stop at the shallows of the Jordan River and wait there for a report from you . ”
10:15:029:0	So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to the city and stayed there .
10:15:030:0	David walked up the road to the Mount of Olives , weeping as he went . His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning . And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the hill .
10:15:031:0	When someone told David that his adviser Ahithophel was now backing Absalom , David prayed , “ O Lord , let Ahithophel give Absalom foolish advice ! ”
10:15:032:0	When David reached the summit of the Mount of Olives where people worshiped God , Hushai the Arkite was waiting there for him . Hushai had torn his clothing and put dirt on his head as a sign of mourning .
10:15:033:0	But David told him , “ If you go with me , you will only be a burden .
10:15:034:0	Return to Jerusalem and tell Absalom , ‘ I will now be your adviser , O king , just as I was your father 's adviser in the past . ' Then you can frustrate and counter Ahithophel 's advice .
10:15:035:0	Zadok and Abiathar , the priests , will be there . Tell them about the plans being made in the king 's palace ,
10:15:036:0	and they will send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what is going on . ”
10:15:037:0	So David 's friend Hushai returned to Jerusalem , getting there just as Absalom arrived .
