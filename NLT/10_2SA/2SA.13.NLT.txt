10:13:001:1	The Rape of Tamar
10:13:001:0	Now David 's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar . And Amnon , her half brother , fell desperately in love with her .
10:13:002:0	Amnon became so obsessed with Tamar that he became ill. She was a virgin , and Amnon thought he could never have her .
10:13:003:0	But Amnon had a very crafty friend—his cousin Jonadab . He was the son of David 's brother Shimea .
10:13:004:0	One day Jonadab said to Amnon , “ What 's the trouble ? Why should the son of a king look so dejected morning after morning ? ” So Amnon told him , “ I am in love with Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister . ”
10:13:005:0	“ Well , ” Jonadab said , “ I 'll tell you what to do . Go back to bed and pretend you are ill . When your father comes to see you , ask him to let Tamar come and prepare some food for you . Tell him you 'll feel better if she prepares it as you watch and feeds you with her own hands . ”
10:13:006:0	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick . And when the king came to see him , Amnon asked him , “ Please let my sister Tamar come and cook my favorite dish as I watch . Then I can eat it from her own hands . ”
10:13:007:0	So David agreed and sent Tamar to Amnon 's house to prepare some food for him .
10:13:008:0	When Tamar arrived at Amnon 's house , she went to the place where he was lying down so he could watch her mix some dough . Then she baked his favorite dish for him .
10:13:009:0	But when she set the serving tray before him , he refused to eat . “ Everyone get out of here , ” Amnon told his servants . So they all left .
10:13:010:0	Then he said to Tamar , “ Now bring the food into my bedroom and feed it to me here. ” So Tamar took his favorite dish to him .
10:13:011:0	But as she was feeding him , he grabbed her and demanded , “ Come to bed with me , my darling sister . ”
10:13:012:0	“ No , my brother ! ” she cried . “ Do n't be foolish ! Do n't do this to me ! Such wicked things are n't done in Israel .
10:13:013:0	Where could I go in my shame ? And you would be called one of the greatest fools in Israel . Please , just speak to the king about it , and he will let you marry me . ”
10:13:014:0	But Amnon would n't listen to her , and since he was stronger than she was , he raped her .
10:13:015:0	Then suddenly Amnon 's love turned to hate , and he hated her even more than he had loved her . “ Get out of here ! ” he snarled at her .
10:13:016:0	“ No , no ! ” Tamar cried . “ Sending me away now is worse than what you 've already done to me. ” But Amnon would n't listen to her .
10:13:017:0	He shouted for his servant and demanded , “ Throw this woman out , and lock the door behind her ! ”
10:13:018:0	So the servant put her out and locked the door behind her . She was wearing a long , beautiful robe , as was the custom in those days for the king 's virgin daughters .
10:13:019:0	But now Tamar tore her robe and put ashes on her head . And then , with her face in her hands , she went away crying .
10:13:020:0	Her brother Absalom saw her and asked , “ Is it true that Amnon has been with you ? Well , my sister , keep quiet for now , since he 's your brother . Do n't you worry about it. ” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in her brother Absalom 's house .
10:13:021:0	When King David heard what had happened , he was very angry .
10:13:002:1	Absalom 's Revenge on Amnon
10:13:022:0	And though Absalom never spoke to Amnon about this , he hated Amnon deeply because of what he had done to his sister .
10:13:023:0	Two years later , when Absalom 's sheep were being sheared at Baal-hazor near Ephraim , Absalom invited all the king 's sons to come to a feast .
10:13:024:0	He went to the king and said , “ My sheep-shearers are now at work . Would the king and his servants please come to celebrate the occasion with me ? ”
10:13:025:0	The king replied , “ No , my son . If we all came , we would be too much of a burden on you. ” Absalom pressed him , but the king would not come , though he gave Absalom his blessing .
10:13:026:0	“ Well , then , ” Absalom said , “ if you ca n't come , how about sending my brother Amnon with us ? ” “ Why Amnon ? ” the king asked .
10:13:027:0	But Absalom kept on pressing the king until he finally agreed to let all his sons attend , including Amnon . So Absalom prepared a feast fit for a king .
10:13:028:0	Absalom told his men , “ Wait until Amnon gets drunk ; then at my signal , kill him ! Do n't be afraid . I 'm the one who has given the command . Take courage and do it ! ”
10:13:029:0	So at Absalom 's signal they murdered Amnon . Then the other sons of the king jumped on their mules and fled .
10:13:030:0	As they were on the way back to Jerusalem , this report reached David : “ Absalom has killed all the king 's sons ; not one is left alive ! ”
10:13:031:0	The king got up , tore his robe , and threw himself on the ground . His advisers also tore their clothes in horror and sorrow .
10:13:032:0	But just then Jonadab , the son of David 's brother Shimea , arrived and said , “ No , do n't believe that all the king 's sons have been killed ! It was only Amnon ! Absalom has been plotting this ever since Amnon raped his sister Tamar .
10:13:033:0	No , my lord the king , your sons are n't all dead ! It was only Amnon . ”
10:13:034:0	Meanwhile Absalom escaped.Then the watchman on the Jerusalem wall saw a great crowd coming down the hill on the road from the west . He ran to tell the king , “ I see a crowd of people coming from the Horonaim road along the side of the hill . ”
10:13:035:0	“ Look ! ” Jonadab told the king . “ There they are now ! The king 's sons are coming , just as I said . ”
10:13:036:0	They soon arrived , weeping and sobbing , and the king and all his servants wept bitterly with them .
10:13:037:0	And David mourned many days for his son Amnon.Absalom fled to his grandfather , Talmai son of Ammihud , the king of Geshur .
10:13:038:0	He stayed there in Geshur for three years .
10:13:039:0	And King David , now reconciled to Amnon 's death , longed to be reunited with his son Absalom .
