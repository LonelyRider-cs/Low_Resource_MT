10:1:001:1	David Learns of Saul 's Death
10:1:001:0	After the death of Saul , David returned from his victory over the Amalekites and spent two days in Ziklag .
10:1:002:0	On the third day a man arrived from Saul 's army camp . He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show that he was in mourning . He fell to the ground before David in deep respect .
10:1:003:0	“ Where have you come from ? ” David asked. “ I escaped from the Israelite camp , ” the man replied .
10:1:004:0	“ What happened ? ” David demanded . “ Tell me how the battle went. ” The man replied , “ Our entire army fled from the battle . Many of the men are dead , and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead . ”
10:1:005:0	“ How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead ? ” David demanded of the young man .
10:1:006:0	The man answered , “ I happened to be on Mount Gilboa , and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the enemy chariots and charioteers closing in on him .
10:1:007:0	When he turned and saw me , he cried out for me to come to him . ‘ How can I help ? ' I asked him .
10:1:008:0	“ He responded , ‘ Who are you ? ' “ ‘ I am an Amalekite , ' I told him .
10:1:009:0	“ Then he begged me , ‘ Come over here and put me out of my misery , for I am in terrible pain and want to die . '
10:1:010:0	“ So I killed him , ” the Amalekite told David , “ for I knew he could n't live . Then I took his crown and his armband , and I have brought them here to you , my lord . ”
10:1:011:0	David and his men tore their clothes in sorrow when they heard the news .
10:1:012:0	They mourned and wept and fasted all day for Saul and his son Jonathan , and for the Lord 's army and the nation of Israel , because they had died by the sword that day .
10:1:013:0	Then David said to the young man who had brought the news , “ Where are you from ? ” And he replied , “ I am a foreigner , an Amalekite , who lives in your land . ”
10:1:014:0	“ Why were you not afraid to kill the Lord 's anointed one ? ” David asked .
10:1:015:0	Then David said to one of his men , “ Kill him ! ” So the man thrust his sword into the Amalekite and killed him .
10:1:002:1	David 's Song for Saul and Jonathan
10:1:016:0	“ You have condemned yourself , ” David said , “ for you yourself confessed that you killed the Lord 's anointed one . ”
10:1:017:0	Then David composed a funeral song for Saul and Jonathan ,
10:1:018:0	and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah . It is known as the Song of the Bow , and it is recorded in The Book of Jashar .
10:1:019:0	Your pride and joy , O Israel , lies dead on the hills ! Oh , how the mighty heroes have fallen !
10:1:020:0	Do n't announce the news in Gath , do n't proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon , or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoiceand the pagans will laugh in triumph .
10:1:021:0	O mountains of Gilboa , let there be no dew or rain upon you , nor fruitful fields producing offerings of grain.For there the shield of the mighty heroes was defiled ; the shield of Saul will no longer be anointed with oil .
10:1:022:0	The bow of Jonathan was powerful , and the sword of Saul did its mighty work.They shed the blood of their enemiesand pierced the bodies of mighty heroes .
10:1:023:0	How beloved and gracious were Saul and Jonathan ! They were together in life and in death.They were swifter than eagles , stronger than lions .
10:1:024:0	O women of Israel , weep for Saul , for he dressed you in luxurious scarlet clothing , in garments decorated with gold .
10:1:025:0	Oh , how the mighty heroes have fallen in battle ! Jonathan lies dead on the hills .
10:1:026:0	How I weep for you , my brother Jonathan ! Oh , how much I loved you ! And your love for me was deep , deeper than the love of women !
10:1:027:0	Oh , how the mighty heroes have fallen ! Stripped of their weapons , they lie dead .
