10:24:001:1	David Takes a Census
10:24:001:0	Once again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel , and he caused David to harm them by taking a census . “ Go and count the people of Israel and Judah , ” the Lord told him .
10:24:002:0	So the king said to Joab and the commanders of the army , “ Take a census of all the tribes of Israel—from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south—so I may know how many people there are . ”
10:24:003:0	But Joab replied to the king , “ May the Lord your God let you live to see a hundred times as many people as there are now ! But why , my lord the king , do you want to do this ? ”
10:24:004:0	But the king insisted that they take the census , so Joab and the commanders of the army went out to count the people of Israel .
10:24:005:0	First they crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer , south of the town in the valley , in the direction of Gad . Then they went on to Jazer ,
10:24:006:0	then to Gilead in the land of Tahtim-hodshi and to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon .
10:24:007:0	Then they came to the fortress of Tyre , and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites . Finally , they went south to Judah as far as Beersheba .
10:24:008:0	Having gone through the entire land for nine months and twenty days , they returned to Jerusalem .
10:24:002:1	Judgment for David 's Sin
10:24:009:0	Joab reported the number of people to the king . There were 800,000 capable warriors in Israel who could handle a sword , and 500,000 in Judah .
10:24:010:0	But after he had taken the census , David 's conscience began to bother him . And he said to the Lord , “ I have sinned greatly by taking this census . Please forgive my guilt , Lord , for doing this foolish thing . ”
10:24:011:0	The next morning the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad , who was David 's seer . This was the message :
10:24:012:0	“ Go and say to David , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will give you three choices . Choose one of these punishments , and I will inflict it on you . ' ”
10:24:013:0	So Gad came to David and asked him , “ Will you choose three years of famine throughout your land , three months of fleeing from your enemies , or three days of severe plague throughout your land ? Think this over and decide what answer I should give the Lord who sent me . ”
10:24:014:0	“ I 'm in a desperate situation ! ” David replied to Gad . “ But let us fall into the hands of the Lord , for his mercy is great . Do not let me fall into human hands . ”
10:24:015:0	So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel that morning , and it lasted for three days . A total of 70,000 people died throughout the nation , from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south .
10:24:016:0	But as the angel was preparing to destroy Jerusalem , the Lord relented and said to the death angel , “ Stop ! That is enough ! ” At that moment the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
10:24:003:1	David Builds an Altar
10:24:017:0	When David saw the angel , he said to the Lord , “ I am the one who has sinned and done wrong ! But these people are as innocent as sheep—what have they done ? Let your anger fall against me and my family . ”
10:24:018:0	That day Gad came to David and said to him , “ Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite . ”
10:24:019:0	So David went up to do what the Lord had commanded him .
10:24:020:0	When Araunah saw the king and his men coming toward him , he came and bowed before the king with his face to the ground .
10:24:021:0	“ Why have you come , my lord the king ? ” Araunah asked.David replied , “ I have come to buy your threshing floor and to build an altar to the Lord there , so that he will stop the plague . ”
10:24:022:0	“ Take it , my lord the king , and use it as you wish , ” Araunah said to David . “ Here are oxen for the burnt offering , and you can use the threshing boards and ox yokes for wood to build a fire on the altar .
10:24:023:0	I will give it all to you , Your Majesty , and may the Lord your God accept your sacrifice . ”
10:24:024:0	But the king replied to Araunah , “ No , I insist on buying it , for I will not present burnt offerings to the Lord my God that have cost me nothing. ” So David paid him fifty pieces of silver for the threshing floor and the oxen .
10:24:025:0	David built an altar there to the Lord and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings . And the Lord answered his prayer for the land , and the plague on Israel was stopped .
