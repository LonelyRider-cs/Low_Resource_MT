10:8:001:1	David 's Military Victories
10:8:001:0	After this , David defeated and subdued the Philistines by conquering Gath , their largest town .
10:8:002:0	David also conquered the land of Moab . He made the people lie down on the ground in a row , and he measured them off in groups with a length of rope . He measured off two groups to be executed for every one group to be spared . The Moabites who were spared became David 's subjects and paid him tribute money .
10:8:003:0	David also destroyed the forces of Hadadezer son of Rehob , king of Zobah , when Hadadezer marched out to strengthen his control along the Euphrates River .
10:8:004:0	David captured 1,000 chariots , 7,000 charioteers , and 20,000 foot soldiers . He crippled all the chariot horses except enough for 100 chariots .
10:8:005:0	When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer , David killed 22,000 of them .
10:8:006:0	Then he placed several army garrisons in Damascus , the Aramean capital , and the Arameans became David 's subjects and paid him tribute money . So the Lord made David victorious wherever he went .
10:8:007:0	David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer 's officers to Jerusalem ,
10:8:008:0	along with a large amount of bronze from Hadadezer 's towns of Tebah and Berothai .
10:8:009:0	When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had destroyed the entire army of Hadadezer ,
10:8:010:0	he sent his son Joram to congratulate King David for his successful campaign . Hadadezer and Toi had been enemies and were often at war . Joram presented David with many gifts of silver , gold , and bronze .
10:8:011:0	King David dedicated all these gifts to the Lord , as he did with the silver and gold from the other nations he had defeated—
10:8:012:0	from Edom , Moab , Ammon , Philistia , and Amalek—and from Hadadezer son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
10:8:013:0	So David became even more famous when he returned from destroying 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt .
10:8:014:0	He placed army garrisons throughout Edom , and all the Edomites became David 's subjects . In fact , the Lord made David victorious wherever he went .
10:8:015:0	So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all his people .
10:8:016:0	Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army . Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian .
10:8:017:0	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were the priests . Seraiah was the court secretary .
10:8:018:0	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king 's bodyguard . And David 's sons served as priestly leaders .
