10:11:001:1	David and Bathsheba
10:11:001:0	In the spring of the year , when kings normally go out to war , David sent Joab and the Israelite army to fight the Ammonites . They destroyed the Ammonite army and laid siege to the city of Rabbah . However , David stayed behind in Jerusalem .
10:11:002:0	Late one afternoon , after his midday rest , David got out of bed and was walking on the roof of the palace . As he looked out over the city , he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath .
10:11:003:0	He sent someone to find out who she was , and he was told , “ She is Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite . ”
10:11:004:0	Then David sent messengers to get her ; and when she came to the palace , he slept with her . She had just completed the purification rites after having her menstrual period . Then she returned home .
10:11:005:0	Later , when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant , she sent David a message , saying , “ I 'm pregnant . ”
10:11:006:0	Then David sent word to Joab : “ Send me Uriah the Hittite. ” So Joab sent him to David .
10:11:007:0	When Uriah arrived , David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing .
10:11:008:0	Then he told Uriah , “ Go on home and relax. ” David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace .
10:11:009:0	But Uriah did n't go home . He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king 's palace guard .
10:11:010:0	When David heard that Uriah had not gone home , he summoned him and asked , “ What 's the matter ? Why did n't you go home last night after being away for so long ? ”
10:11:011:0	Uriah replied , “ The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents , and Joab and my master 's men are camping in the open fields . How could I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife ? I swear that I would never do such a thing . ”
10:11:012:0	“ Well , stay here today , ” David told him , “ and tomorrow you may return to the army. ” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next .
10:11:002:1	David Arranges for Uriah 's Death
10:11:013:0	Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk . But even then he could n't get Uriah to go home to his wife . Again he slept at the palace entrance with the king 's palace guard .
10:11:014:0	So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver .
10:11:015:0	The letter instructed Joab , “ Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest . Then pull back so that he will be killed . ”
10:11:016:0	So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy 's strongest men were fighting .
10:11:017:0	And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight , Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite soldiers .
10:11:018:0	Then Joab sent a battle report to David .
10:11:019:0	He told his messenger , “ Report all the news of the battle to the king .
10:11:020:0	But he might get angry and ask , ‘ Why did the troops go so close to the city ? Did n't they know there would be shooting from the walls ?
10:11:021:0	Was n't Abimelech son of Gideon killed at Thebez by a woman who threw a millstone down on him from the wall ? Why would you get so close to the wall ? ' Then tell him , ‘ Uriah the Hittite was killed , too . ' ”
10:11:022:0	So the messenger went to Jerusalem and gave a complete report to David .
10:11:023:0	“ The enemy came out against us in the open fields , ” he said . “ And as we chased them back to the city gate ,
10:11:024:0	the archers on the wall shot arrows at us . Some of the king 's men were killed , including Uriah the Hittite . ”
10:11:025:0	“ Well , tell Joab not to be discouraged , ” David said . “ The sword devours this one today and that one tomorrow ! Fight harder next time , and conquer the city ! ”
10:11:026:0	When Uriah 's wife heard that her husband was dead , she mourned for him .
10:11:027:0	When the period of mourning was over , David sent for her and brought her to the palace , and she became one of his wives . Then she gave birth to a son . But the Lord was displeased with what David had done .
