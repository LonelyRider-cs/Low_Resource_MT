11:5:001:1	Preparations for Building the Temple
11:5:001:0	King Hiram of Tyre had always been a loyal friend of David . When Hiram learned that David 's son Solomon was the new king of Israel , he sent ambassadors to congratulate him .
11:5:002:0	Then Solomon sent this message back to Hiram :
11:5:003:0	“ You know that my father , David , was not able to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord his God because of the many wars waged against him by surrounding nations . He could not build until the Lord gave him victory over all his enemies .
11:5:004:0	But now the Lord my God has given me peace on every side ; I have no enemies , and all is well .
11:5:005:0	So I am planning to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord my God , just as he had instructed my father , David . For the Lord told him , ‘ Your son , whom I will place on your throne , will build the Temple to honor my name . '
11:5:006:0	“ Therefore , please command that cedars from Lebanon be cut for me . Let my men work alongside yours , and I will pay your men whatever wages you ask . As you know , there is no one among us who can cut timber like you Sidonians ! ”
11:5:007:0	When Hiram received Solomon 's message , he was very pleased and said , “ Praise the Lord today for giving David a wise son to be king of the great nation of Israel . ”
11:5:008:0	Then he sent this reply to Solomon : “ I have received your message , and I will supply all the cedar and cypress timber you need .
11:5:009:0	My servants will bring the logs from the Lebanon mountains to the Mediterranean Sea and make them into rafts and float them along the coast to whatever place you choose . Then we will break the rafts apart so you can carry the logs away . You can pay me by supplying me with food for my household . ”
11:5:010:0	So Hiram supplied as much cedar and cypress timber as Solomon desired .
11:5:011:0	In return , Solomon sent him an annual payment of 100,000 bushels of wheat for his household and 110,000 gallons of pure olive oil .
11:5:012:0	So the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon , just as he had promised . And Hiram and Solomon made a formal alliance of peace .
11:5:013:0	Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force of 30,000 men from all Israel .
11:5:014:0	He sent them to Lebanon in shifts , 10,000 every month , so that each man would be one month in Lebanon and two months at home . Adoniram was in charge of this labor force .
11:5:015:0	Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers , 80,000 quarry workers in the hill country ,
11:5:016:0	and 3,600 foremen to supervise the work .
11:5:017:0	At the king 's command , they quarried large blocks of high-quality stone and shaped them to make the foundation of the Temple .
11:5:018:0	Men from the city of Gebal helped Solomon 's and Hiram 's builders prepare the timber and stone for the Temple .
