11:22:001:1	Jehoshaphat and Ahab
11:22:001:0	For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel .
11:22:002:0	Then during the third year , King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel .
11:22:003:0	During the visit , the king of Israel said to his officials , “ Do you realize that the town of Ramoth-gilead belongs to us ? And yet we 've done nothing to recapture it from the king of Aram ! ”
11:22:004:0	Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked , “ Will you join me in battle to recover Ramoth-gilead ? ” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel , “ Why , of course ! You and I are as one . My troops are your troops , and my horses are your horses . ”
11:22:005:0	Then Jehoshaphat added , “ But first let 's find out what the Lord says . ”
11:22:006:0	So the king of Israel summoned the prophets , about 400 of them , and asked them , “ Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead , or should I hold back ? ” They all replied , “ Yes , go right ahead ! The Lord will give the king victory . ”
11:22:007:0	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here ? We should ask him the same question . ”
11:22:008:0	The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat , “ There is one more man who could consult the Lord for us , but I hate him . He never prophesies anything but trouble for me ! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah. ” Jehoshaphat replied , “ That 's not the way a king should talk ! Let 's hear what he has to say . ”
11:22:002:1	Micaiah Prophesies against Ahab
11:22:009:0	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said , “ Quick ! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah . ”
11:22:010:0	King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah , dressed in their royal robes , were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria . All of Ahab 's prophets were prophesying there in front of them .
11:22:011:0	One of them , Zedekiah son of Kenaanah , made some iron horns and proclaimed , “ This is what the Lord says : With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death ! ”
11:22:012:0	All the other prophets agreed . “ Yes , ” they said , “ go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious , for the Lord will give the king victory ! ”
11:22:013:0	Meanwhile , the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him , “ Look , all the prophets are promising victory for the king . Be sure that you agree with them and promise success . ”
11:22:014:0	But Micaiah replied , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I will say only what the Lord tells me to say . ”
11:22:015:0	When Micaiah arrived before the king , Ahab asked him , “ Micaiah , should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead , or should we hold back ? ” Micaiah replied sarcastically , “ Yes , go up and be victorious , for the Lord will give the king victory ! ”
11:22:016:0	But the king replied sharply , “ How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the Lord ? ”
11:22:017:0	Then Micaiah told him , “ In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , like sheep without a shepherd . And the Lord said , ‘ Their master has been killed . Send them home in peace . ' ”
11:22:018:0	“ Did n't I tell you ? ” the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat . “ He never prophesies anything but trouble for me . ”
11:22:019:0	Then Micaiah continued , “ Listen to what the Lord says ! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him , on his right and on his left .
11:22:020:0	And the Lord said , ‘ Who can entice Ahab to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed ? ' “ There were many suggestions ,
11:22:021:0	and finally a spirit approached the Lord and said , ‘ I can do it ! '
11:22:022:0	“ ‘ How will you do this ? ' the Lord asked. “ And the spirit replied , ‘ I will go out and inspire all of Ahab 's prophets to speak lies . ' “ ‘ You will succeed , ' said the Lord . ‘ Go ahead and do it . '
11:22:023:0	“ So you see , the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all your prophets . For the Lord has pronounced your doom . ”
11:22:024:0	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face . “ Since when did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you ? ” he demanded .
11:22:025:0	And Micaiah replied , “ You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room ! ”
11:22:026:0	“ Arrest him ! ” the king of Israel ordered . “ Take him back to Amon , the governor of the city , and to my son Joash .
11:22:027:0	Give them this order from the king : ‘ Put this man in prison , and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle ! ' ”
11:22:003:1	The Death of Ahab
11:22:028:0	But Micaiah replied , “ If you return safely , it will mean that the Lord has not spoken through me ! ” Then he added to those standing around , “ Everyone mark my words ! ”
11:22:029:0	So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead .
11:22:030:0	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ As we go into battle , I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me , but you wear your royal robes. ” So the king of Israel disguised himself , and they went into battle .
11:22:031:0	Meanwhile , the king of Aram had issued these orders to his thirty-two chariot commanders : “ Attack only the king of Israel . Do n't bother with anyone else ! ”
11:22:032:0	So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes , they went after him . “ There is the king of Israel ! ” they shouted . But when Jehoshaphat called out ,
11:22:033:0	the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel , and they stopped chasing him .
11:22:034:0	An Aramean soldier , however , randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor . “ Turn the horses and get me out of here ! ” Ahab groaned to the driver of his chariot . “ I 'm badly wounded ! ”
11:22:035:0	The battle raged all that day , and the king remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans . The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of his chariot , and as evening arrived he died .
11:22:036:0	Just as the sun was setting , the cry ran through his troops : “ We 're done for ! Run for your lives ! ”
11:22:037:0	So the king died , and his body was taken to Samaria and buried there .
11:22:038:0	Then his chariot was washed beside the pool of Samaria , and dogs came and licked his blood at the place where the prostitutes bathed , just as the Lord had promised .
11:22:039:0	The rest of the events in Ahab 's reign and everything he did , including the story of the ivory palace and the towns he built , are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
11:22:004:1	Jehoshaphat Rules in Judah
11:22:040:0	So Ahab died , and his son Ahaziah became the next king .
11:22:041:0	Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to rule over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab 's reign in Israel .
11:22:042:0	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years . His mother was Azubah , the daughter of Shilhi .
11:22:043:0	Jehoshaphat was a good king , following the example of his father , Asa . He did what was pleasing in the Lord 's sight . During his reign , however , he failed to remove all the pagan shrines , and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there .
11:22:044:0	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel .
11:22:045:0	The rest of the events in Jehoshaphat 's reign , the extent of his power , and the wars he waged are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
11:22:046:0	He banished from the land the rest of the male and female shrine prostitutes , who still continued their practices from the days of his father , Asa .
11:22:047:0	( There was no king in Edom at that time , only a deputy . )
11:22:048:0	Jehoshaphat also built a fleet of trading ships to sail to Ophir for gold . But the ships never set sail , for they met with disaster in their home port of Ezion-geber .
11:22:049:0	At one time Ahaziah son of Ahab had proposed to Jehoshaphat , “ Let my men sail with your men in the ships. ” But Jehoshaphat refused the request .
11:22:005:1	Ahaziah Rules in Israel
11:22:050:0	When Jehoshaphat died , he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David . Then his son Jehoram became the next king .
11:22:051:0	Ahaziah son of Ahab began to rule over Israel in the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat 's reign in Judah . He reigned in Samaria two years .
11:22:052:0	But he did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , following the example of his father and mother and the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat , who had led Israel to sin .
11:22:053:0	He served Baal and worshiped him , provoking the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel , just as his father had done .
