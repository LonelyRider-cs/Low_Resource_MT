11:2:001:1	David 's Final Instructions to Solomon
11:2:001:0	As the time of King David 's death approached , he gave this charge to his son Solomon :
11:2:002:0	“ I am going where everyone on earth must someday go . Take courage and be a man .
11:2:003:0	Observe the requirements of the Lord your God , and follow all his ways . Keep the decrees , commands , regulations , and laws written in the Law of Moses so that you will be successful in all you do and wherever you go .
11:2:004:0	If you do this , then the Lord will keep the promise he made to me . He told me , ‘ If your descendants live as they should and follow me faithfully with all their heart and soul , one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel . '
11:2:005:0	“ And there is something else . You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me when he murdered my two army commanders , Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether . He pretended that it was an act of war , but it was done in a time of peace , staining his belt and sandals with innocent blood .
11:2:006:0	Do with him what you think best , but do n't let him grow old and go to his grave in peace .
11:2:007:0	“ Be kind to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead . Make them permanent guests at your table , for they took care of me when I fled from your brother Absalom .
11:2:008:0	“ And remember Shimei son of Gera , the man from Bahurim in Benjamin . He cursed me with a terrible curse as I was fleeing to Mahanaim . When he came down to meet me at the Jordan River , I swore by the Lord that I would not kill him .
11:2:009:0	But that oath does not make him innocent . You are a wise man , and you will know how to arrange a bloody death for him . ”
11:2:010:0	Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David .
11:2:011:0	David had reigned over Israel for forty years , seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem .
11:2:002:1	Solomon Establishes His Rule
11:2:012:0	Solomon became king and sat on the throne of David his father , and his kingdom was firmly established .
11:2:013:0	One day Adonijah , whose mother was Haggith , came to see Bathsheba , Solomon 's mother . “ Have you come with peaceful intentions ? ” she asked him. “ Yes , ” he said , “ I come in peace .
11:2:014:0	In fact , I have a favor to ask of you. ” “ What is it ? ” she asked .
11:2:015:0	He replied , “ As you know , the kingdom was rightfully mine ; all Israel wanted me to be the next king . But the tables were turned , and the kingdom went to my brother instead ; for that is the way the Lord wanted it .
11:2:016:0	So now I have just one favor to ask of you . Please do n't turn me down. ” “ What is it ? ” she asked .
11:2:017:0	He replied , “ Speak to King Solomon on my behalf , for I know he will do anything you request . Ask him to let me marry Abishag , the girl from Shunem . ”
11:2:018:0	“ All right , ” Bathsheba replied . “ I will speak to the king for you . ”
11:2:019:0	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak on Adonijah 's behalf . The king rose from his throne to meet her , and he bowed down before her . When he sat down on his throne again , the king ordered that a throne be brought for his mother , and she sat at his right hand .
11:2:020:0	“ I have one small request to make of you , ” she said . “ I hope you wo n't turn me down. ” “ What is it , my mother ? ” he asked . “ You know I wo n't refuse you . ”
11:2:021:0	“ Then let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag , the girl from Shunem , ” she replied .
11:2:022:0	“ How can you possibly ask me to give Abishag to Adonijah ? ” King Solomon demanded . “ You might as well ask me to give him the kingdom ! You know that he is my older brother , and that he has Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah on his side . ”
11:2:023:0	Then King Solomon made a vow before the Lord : “ May God strike me and even kill me if Adonijah has not sealed his fate with this request .
11:2:024:0	The Lord has confirmed me and placed me on the throne of my father , David ; he has established my dynasty as he promised . So as surely as the Lord lives , Adonijah will die this very day ! ”
11:2:025:0	So King Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him , and Adonijah was put to death .
11:2:026:0	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest , “ Go back to your home in Anathoth . You deserve to die , but I will not kill you now , because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign Lord for David my father and you shared all his hardships . ”
11:2:027:0	So Solomon deposed Abiathar from his position as priest of the Lord , thereby fulfilling the prophecy the Lord had given at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli .
11:2:028:0	Joab had not joined Absalom 's earlier rebellion , but he had joined Adonijah 's rebellion . So when Joab heard about Adonijah 's death , he ran to the sacred tent of the Lord and grabbed on to the horns of the altar .
11:2:029:0	When this was reported to King Solomon , he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him .
11:2:030:0	Benaiah went to the sacred tent of the Lord and said to Joab , “ The king orders you to come out ! ” But Joab answered , “ No , I will die here. ” So Benaiah returned to the king and told him what Joab had said .
11:2:031:0	“ Do as he said , ” the king replied . “ Kill him there beside the altar and bury him . This will remove the guilt of Joab 's senseless murders from me and from my father 's family .
11:2:032:0	The Lord will repay him for the murders of two men who were more righteous and better than he . For my father knew nothing about the deaths of Abner son of Ner , commander of the army of Israel , and of Amasa son of Jether , commander of the army of Judah .
11:2:033:0	May their blood be on Joab and his descendants forever , and may the Lord grant peace forever to David , his descendants , his dynasty , and his throne . ”
11:2:034:0	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada returned to the sacred tent and killed Joab , and he was buried at his home in the wilderness .
11:2:035:0	Then the king appointed Benaiah to command the army in place of Joab , and he installed Zadok the priest to take the place of Abiathar .
11:2:036:0	The king then sent for Shimei and told him , “ Build a house here in Jerusalem and live there . But do n't step outside the city to go anywhere else .
11:2:037:0	On the day you so much as cross the Kidron Valley , you will surely die ; and your blood will be on your own head . ”
11:2:038:0	Shimei replied , “ Your sentence is fair ; I will do whatever my lord the king commands. ” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time .
11:2:039:0	But three years later two of Shimei 's slaves ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath . When Shimei learned where they were ,
11:2:040:0	he saddled his donkey and went to Gath to search for them . When he found them , he brought them back to Jerusalem .
11:2:041:0	Solomon heard that Shimei had left Jerusalem and had gone to Gath and returned .
11:2:042:0	So the king sent for Shimei and demanded , “ Did n't I make you swear by the Lord and warn you not to go anywhere else or you would surely die ? And you replied , ‘ The sentence is fair ; I will do as you say . '
11:2:043:0	Then why have n't you kept your oath to the Lord and obeyed my command ? ”
11:2:044:0	The king also said to Shimei , “ You certainly remember all the wicked things you did to my father , David . May the Lord now bring that evil on your own head .
11:2:045:0	But may I , King Solomon , receive the Lord 's blessings , and may one of David 's descendants always sit on this throne in the presence of the Lord . ”
11:2:046:0	Then , at the king 's command , Benaiah son of Jehoiada took Shimei outside and killed him.So the kingdom was now firmly in Solomon 's grip .
