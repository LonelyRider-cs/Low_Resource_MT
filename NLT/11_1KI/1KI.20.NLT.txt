11:20:001:1	Ben-Hadad Attacks Samaria
11:20:001:0	About that time King Ben-hadad of Aram mobilized his army , supported by the chariots and horses of thirty-two allied kings . They went to besiege Samaria , the capital of Israel , and launched attacks against it .
11:20:002:0	Ben-hadad sent messengers into the city to relay this message to King Ahab of Israel : “ This is what Ben-hadad says :
11:20:003:0	‘ Your silver and gold are mine , and so are your wives and the best of your children ! ' ”
11:20:004:0	“ All right , my lord the king , ” Israel 's king replied . “ All that I have is yours ! ”
11:20:005:0	Soon Ben-hadad 's messengers returned again and said , “ This is what Ben-hadad says : ‘ I have already demanded that you give me your silver , gold , wives , and children .
11:20:006:0	But about this time tomorrow I will send my officials to search your palace and the homes of your officials . They will take away everything you consider valuable ! ' ”
11:20:007:0	Then Ahab summoned all the elders of the land and said to them , “ Look how this man is stirring up trouble ! I already agreed with his demand that I give him my wives and children and silver and gold . ”
11:20:008:0	“ Do n't give in to any more demands , ” all the elders and the people advised .
11:20:009:0	So Ahab told the messengers from Ben-hadad , “ Say this to my lord the king : ‘ I will give you everything you asked for the first time , but I can not accept this last demand of yours . ' ” So the messengers returned to Ben-hadad with that response .
11:20:010:0	Then Ben-hadad sent this message to Ahab : “ May the gods strike me and even kill me if there remains enough dust from Samaria to provide even a handful for each of my soldiers . ”
11:20:011:0	The king of Israel sent back this answer : “ A warrior putting on his sword for battle should not boast like a warrior who has already won . ”
11:20:002:1	Ahab 's Victory over Ben-Hadad
11:20:012:0	Ahab 's reply reached Ben-hadad and the other kings as they were drinking in their tents . “ Prepare to attack ! ” Ben-hadad commanded his officers . So they prepared to attack the city .
11:20:013:0	Then a certain prophet came to see King Ahab of Israel and told him , “ This is what the Lord says : Do you see all these enemy forces ? Today I will hand them all over to you . Then you will know that I am the Lord . ”
11:20:014:0	Ahab asked , “ How will he do it ? ” And the prophet replied , “ This is what the Lord says : The troops of the provincial commanders will do it. ” “ Should we attack first ? ” Ahab asked. “ Yes , ” the prophet answered .
11:20:015:0	So Ahab mustered the troops of the 232 provincial commanders . Then he called out the rest of the army of Israel , some 7,000 men .
11:20:016:0	About noontime , as Ben-hadad and the thirty-two allied kings were still in their tents drinking themselves into a stupor ,
11:20:017:0	the troops of the provincial commanders marched out of the city as the first contingent.As they approached , Ben-hadad 's scouts reported to him , “ Some troops are coming from Samaria . ”
11:20:018:0	“ Take them alive , ” Ben-hadad commanded , “ whether they have come for peace or for war . ”
11:20:019:0	But Ahab 's provincial commanders and the entire army had now come out to fight .
11:20:020:0	Each Israelite soldier killed his Aramean opponent , and suddenly the entire Aramean army panicked and fled . The Israelites chased them , but King Ben-hadad and a few of his charioteers escaped on horses .
11:20:021:0	However , the king of Israel destroyed the other horses and chariots and slaughtered the Arameans .
11:20:003:1	Ben-Hadad 's Second Attack
11:20:022:0	Afterward the prophet said to King Ahab , “ Get ready for another attack . Begin making plans now , for the king of Aram will come back next spring . ”
11:20:023:0	After their defeat , Ben-hadad 's officers said to him , “ The Israelite gods are gods of the hills ; that is why they won . But we can beat them easily on the plains .
11:20:024:0	Only this time replace the kings with field commanders !
11:20:025:0	Recruit another army like the one you lost . Give us the same number of horses , chariots , and men , and we will fight against them on the plains . There 's no doubt that we will beat them. ” So King Ben-hadad did as they suggested .
11:20:026:0	The following spring he called up the Aramean army and marched out against Israel , this time at Aphek .
11:20:027:0	Israel then mustered its army , set up supply lines , and marched out for battle . But the Israelite army looked like two little flocks of goats in comparison to the vast Aramean forces that filled the countryside !
11:20:028:0	Then the man of God went to the king of Israel and said , “ This is what the Lord says : The Arameans have said , ‘ The Lord is a god of the hills and not of the plains . ' So I will defeat this vast army for you . Then you will know that I am the Lord . ”
11:20:029:0	The two armies camped opposite each other for seven days , and on the seventh day the battle began . The Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean foot soldiers in one day .
11:20:030:0	The rest fled into the town of Aphek , but the wall fell on them and killed another 27,000 . Ben-hadad fled into the town and hid in a secret room .
11:20:031:0	Ben-hadad 's officers said to him , “ Sir , we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful . So let 's humble ourselves by wearing burlap around our waists and putting ropes on our heads , and surrender to the king of Israel . Then perhaps he will let you live . ”
11:20:032:0	So they put on burlap and ropes , and they went to the king of Israel and begged , “ Your servant Ben-hadad says , ‘ Please let me live ! ' ” The king of Israel responded , “ Is he still alive ? He is my brother ! ”
11:20:033:0	The men took this as a good sign and quickly picked up on his words . “ Yes , ” they said , “ your brother Ben-hadad ! ” “ Go and get him , ” the king of Israel told them . And when Ben-hadad arrived , Ahab invited him up into his chariot .
11:20:004:1	A Prophet Condemns Ahab
11:20:034:0	Ben-hadad told him , “ I will give back the towns my father took from your father , and you may establish places of trade in Damascus , as my father did in Samaria. ” Then Ahab said , “ I will release you under these conditions. ” So they made a new treaty , and Ben-hadad was set free .
11:20:035:0	Meanwhile , the Lord instructed one of the group of prophets to say to another man , “ Hit me ! ” But the man refused to hit the prophet .
11:20:036:0	Then the prophet told him , “ Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me. ” And when he had gone , a lion did attack and kill him .
11:20:037:0	Then the prophet turned to another man and said , “ Hit me ! ” So he struck the prophet and wounded him .
11:20:038:0	The prophet placed a bandage over his eyes to disguise himself and then waited beside the road for the king .
11:20:039:0	As the king passed by , the prophet called out to him , “ Sir , I was in the thick of battle , and suddenly a man brought me a prisoner . He said , ‘ Guard this man ; if for any reason he gets away , you will either die or pay a fine of seventy-five pounds of silver ! '
11:20:040:0	But while I was busy doing something else , the prisoner disappeared ! ” “ Well , it 's your own fault , ” the king replied . “ You have brought the judgment on yourself . ”
11:20:041:0	Then the prophet quickly pulled the bandage from his eyes , and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets .
11:20:042:0	The prophet said to him , “ This is what the Lord says : Because you have spared the man I said must be destroyed , now you must die in his place , and your people will die instead of his people . ”
11:20:043:0	So the king of Israel went home to Samaria angry and sullen .
