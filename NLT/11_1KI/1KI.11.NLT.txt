11:11:001:1	Solomon 's Many Wives
11:11:001:0	Now King Solomon loved many foreign women . Besides Pharaoh 's daughter , he married women from Moab , Ammon , Edom , Sidon , and from among the Hittites .
11:11:002:0	The Lord had clearly instructed the people of Israel , “ You must not marry them , because they will turn your hearts to their gods. ” Yet Solomon insisted on loving them anyway .
11:11:003:0	He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines . And in fact , they did turn his heart away from the Lord .
11:11:004:0	In Solomon 's old age , they turned his heart to worship other gods instead of being completely faithful to the Lord his God , as his father , David , had been .
11:11:005:0	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth , the goddess of the Sidonians , and Molech , the detestable god of the Ammonites .
11:11:006:0	In this way , Solomon did what was evil in the Lord 's sight ; he refused to follow the Lord completely , as his father , David , had done .
11:11:007:0	On the Mount of Olives , east of Jerusalem , he even built a pagan shrine for Chemosh , the detestable god of Moab , and another for Molech , the detestable god of the Ammonites .
11:11:008:0	Solomon built such shrines for all his foreign wives to use for burning incense and sacrificing to their gods .
11:11:009:0	The Lord was very angry with Solomon , for his heart had turned away from the Lord , the God of Israel , who had appeared to him twice .
11:11:010:0	He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods , but Solomon did not listen to the Lord 's command .
11:11:011:0	So now the Lord said to him , “ Since you have not kept my covenant and have disobeyed my decrees , I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants .
11:11:012:0	But for the sake of your father , David , I will not do this while you are still alive . I will take the kingdom away from your son .
11:11:002:1	Solomon 's Adversaries
11:11:013:0	And even so , I will not take away the entire kingdom ; I will let him be king of one tribe , for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem , my chosen city . ”
11:11:014:0	Then the Lord raised up Hadad the Edomite , a member of Edom 's royal family , to be Solomon 's adversary .
11:11:015:0	Years before , David had defeated Edom . Joab , his army commander , had stayed to bury some of the Israelite soldiers who had died in battle . While there , they killed every male in Edom .
11:11:016:0	Joab and the army of Israel had stayed there for six months , killing them .
11:11:017:0	But Hadad and a few of his father 's royal officials escaped and headed for Egypt . ( Hadad was just a boy at the time . )
11:11:018:0	They set out from Midian and went to Paran , where others joined them . Then they traveled to Egypt and went to Pharaoh , who gave them a home , food , and some land .
11:11:019:0	Pharaoh grew very fond of Hadad , and he gave him his wife 's sister in marriage—the sister of Queen Tahpenes .
11:11:020:0	She bore him a son named Genubath . Tahpenes raised him in Pharaoh 's palace among Pharaoh 's own sons .
11:11:021:0	When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David and his commander Joab were both dead , he said to Pharaoh , “ Let me return to my own country . ”
11:11:022:0	“ Why ? ” Pharaoh asked him . “ What do you lack here that makes you want to go home ? ” “ Nothing , ” he replied . “ But even so , please let me return home . ”
11:11:023:0	God also raised up Rezon son of Eliada as Solomon 's adversary . Rezon had fled from his master , King Hadadezer of Zobah ,
11:11:024:0	and had become the leader of a gang of rebels . After David conquered Hadadezer , Rezon and his men fled to Damascus , where he became king .
11:11:003:1	Jeroboam Rebels against Solomon
11:11:025:0	Rezon was Israel 's bitter adversary for the rest of Solomon 's reign , and he made trouble , just as Hadad did . Rezon hated Israel intensely and continued to reign in Aram .
11:11:026:0	Another rebel leader was Jeroboam son of Nebat , one of Solomon 's own officials . He came from the town of Zeredah in Ephraim , and his mother was Zeruah , a widow .
11:11:027:0	This is the story behind his rebellion . Solomon was rebuilding the supporting terraces and repairing the walls of the city of his father , David .
11:11:028:0	Jeroboam was a very capable young man , and when Solomon saw how industrious he was , he put him in charge of the labor force from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh , the descendants of Joseph .
11:11:029:0	One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem , the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him along the way . Ahijah was wearing a new cloak . The two of them were alone in a field ,
11:11:030:0	and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces .
11:11:031:0	Then he said to Jeroboam , “ Take ten of these pieces , for this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon , and I will give ten of the tribes to you !
11:11:032:0	But I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel .
11:11:033:0	For Solomon has abandoned me and worshiped Ashtoreth , the goddess of the Sidonians ; Chemosh , the god of Moab ; and Molech , the god of the Ammonites . He has not followed my ways and done what is pleasing in my sight . He has not obeyed my decrees and regulations as David his father did .
11:11:034:0	“ ‘ But I will not take the entire kingdom from Solomon at this time . For the sake of my servant David , the one whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees , I will keep Solomon as leader for the rest of his life .
11:11:035:0	But I will take the kingdom away from his son and give ten of the tribes to you .
11:11:036:0	His son will have one tribe so that the descendants of David my servant will continue to reign , shining like a lamp in Jerusalem , the city I have chosen to be the place for my name .
11:11:037:0	And I will place you on the throne of Israel , and you will rule over all that your heart desires .
11:11:038:0	If you listen to what I tell you and follow my ways and do whatever I consider to be right , and if you obey my decrees and commands , as my servant David did , then I will always be with you . I will establish an enduring dynasty for you as I did for David , and I will give Israel to you .
11:11:039:0	Because of Solomon 's sin I will punish the descendants of David—though not forever . ' ”
11:11:004:1	Summary of Solomon 's Reign
11:11:040:0	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam , but he fled to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon died .
11:11:041:0	The rest of the events in Solomon 's reign , including all his deeds and his wisdom , are recorded in The Book of the Acts of Solomon .

11:11:043:0	When he died , he was buried in the City of David , named for his father . Then his son Rehoboam became the next king .
