11:18:001:1	The Contest on Mount Carmel
11:18:001:0	Later on , in the third year of the drought , the Lord said to Elijah , “ Go and present yourself to King Ahab . Tell him that I will soon send rain ! ”
11:18:002:0	So Elijah went to appear before Ahab.Meanwhile , the famine had become very severe in Samaria .
11:18:003:0	So Ahab summoned Obadiah , who was in charge of the palace . ( Obadiah was a devoted follower of the Lord .
11:18:004:0	Once when Jezebel had tried to kill all the Lord 's prophets , Obadiah had hidden 100 of them in two caves . He put fifty prophets in each cave and supplied them with food and water . )
11:18:005:0	Ahab said to Obadiah , “ We must check every spring and valley in the land to see if we can find enough grass to save at least some of my horses and mules . ”
11:18:006:0	So they divided the land between them . Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
11:18:007:0	As Obadiah was walking along , he suddenly saw Elijah coming toward him . Obadiah recognized him at once and bowed low to the ground before him . “ Is it really you , my lord Elijah ? ” he asked .
11:18:008:0	“ Yes , it is , ” Elijah replied . “ Now go and tell your master , ‘ Elijah is here . ' ”
11:18:009:0	“ Oh , sir , ” Obadiah protested , “ what harm have I done to you that you are sending me to my death at the hands of Ahab ?
11:18:010:0	For I swear by the Lord your God that the king has searched every nation and kingdom on earth from end to end to find you . And each time he was told , ‘ Elijah is n't here , ' King Ahab forced the king of that nation to swear to the truth of his claim .
11:18:011:0	And now you say , ‘ Go and tell your master , “ Elijah is here . ” '
11:18:012:0	But as soon as I leave you , the Spirit of the Lord will carry you away to who knows where . When Ahab comes and can not find you , he will kill me . Yet I have been a true servant of the Lord all my life .
11:18:013:0	Has no one told you , my lord , about the time when Jezebel was trying to kill the Lord 's prophets ? I hid 100 of them in two caves and supplied them with food and water .
11:18:014:0	And now you say , ‘ Go and tell your master , “ Elijah is here. ” ' Sir , if I do that , Ahab will certainly kill me . ”
11:18:015:0	But Elijah said , “ I swear by the Lord Almighty , in whose presence I stand , that I will present myself to Ahab this very day . ”
11:18:016:0	So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come , and Ahab went out to meet Elijah .
11:18:017:0	When Ahab saw him , he exclaimed , “ So , is it really you , you troublemaker of Israel ? ”
11:18:018:0	“ I have made no trouble for Israel , ” Elijah replied . “ You and your family are the troublemakers , for you have refused to obey the commands of the Lord and have worshiped the images of Baal instead .
11:18:019:0	Now summon all Israel to join me at Mount Carmel , along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who are supported by Jezebel . ”
11:18:020:0	So Ahab summoned all the people of Israel and the prophets to Mount Carmel .
11:18:021:0	Then Elijah stood in front of them and said , “ How much longer will you waver , hobbling between two opinions ? If the Lord is God , follow him ! But if Baal is God , then follow him ! ” But the people were completely silent .
11:18:022:0	Then Elijah said to them , “ I am the only prophet of the Lord who is left , but Baal has 450 prophets .
11:18:023:0	Now bring two bulls . The prophets of Baal may choose whichever one they wish and cut it into pieces and lay it on the wood of their altar , but without setting fire to it . I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood on the altar , but not set fire to it .
11:18:024:0	Then call on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of the Lord . The god who answers by setting fire to the wood is the true God ! ” And all the people agreed .
11:18:025:0	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ You go first , for there are many of you . Choose one of the bulls , and prepare it and call on the name of your god . But do not set fire to the wood . ”
11:18:026:0	So they prepared one of the bulls and placed it on the altar . Then they called on the name of Baal from morning until noontime , shouting , “ O Baal , answer us ! ” But there was no reply of any kind . Then they danced , hobbling around the altar they had made .
11:18:027:0	About noontime Elijah began mocking them . “ You 'll have to shout louder , ” he scoffed , “ for surely he is a god ! Perhaps he is daydreaming , or is relieving himself . Or maybe he is away on a trip , or is asleep and needs to be wakened ! ”
11:18:028:0	So they shouted louder , and following their normal custom , they cut themselves with knives and swords until the blood gushed out .
11:18:029:0	They raved all afternoon until the time of the evening sacrifice , but still there was no sound , no reply , no response .
11:18:030:0	Then Elijah called to the people , “ Come over here ! ” They all crowded around him as he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down .
11:18:031:0	He took twelve stones , one to represent each of the tribes of Israel ,
11:18:032:0	and he used the stones to rebuild the altar in the name of the Lord . Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold about three gallons .
11:18:033:0	He piled wood on the altar , cut the bull into pieces , and laid the pieces on the wood.Then he said , “ Fill four large jars with water , and pour the water over the offering and the wood . ”
11:18:034:0	After they had done this , he said , “ Do the same thing again ! ” And when they were finished , he said , “ Now do it a third time ! ” So they did as he said ,
11:18:035:0	and the water ran around the altar and even filled the trench .
11:18:036:0	At the usual time for offering the evening sacrifice , Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed , “ O Lord , God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant . Prove that I have done all this at your command .
11:18:037:0	O Lord , answer me ! Answer me so these people will know that you , O Lord , are God and that you have brought them back to yourself . ”
11:18:038:0	Immediately the fire of the Lord flashed down from heaven and burned up the young bull , the wood , the stones , and the dust . It even licked up all the water in the trench !
11:18:039:0	And when all the people saw it , they fell face down on the ground and cried out , “ The Lord—he is God ! Yes , the Lord is God ! ”
11:18:002:1	Elijah Prays for Rain
11:18:040:0	Then Elijah commanded , “ Seize all the prophets of Baal . Do n't let a single one escape ! ” So the people seized them all , and Elijah took them down to the Kishon Valley and killed them there .
11:18:041:0	Then Elijah said to Ahab , “ Go get something to eat and drink , for I hear a mighty rainstorm coming ! ”
11:18:042:0	So Ahab went to eat and drink . But Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel and bowed low to the ground and prayed with his face between his knees .
11:18:043:0	Then he said to his servant , “ Go and look out toward the sea. ” The servant went and looked , then returned to Elijah and said , “ I did n't see anything. ” Seven times Elijah told him to go and look .
11:18:044:0	Finally the seventh time , his servant told him , “ I saw a little cloud about the size of a man 's hand rising from the sea. ” Then Elijah shouted , “ Hurry to Ahab and tell him , ‘ Climb into your chariot and go back home . If you do n't hurry , the rain will stop you ! ' ”
11:18:045:0	And soon the sky was black with clouds . A heavy wind brought a terrific rainstorm , and Ahab left quickly for Jezreel .
11:18:046:0	Then the Lord gave special strength to Elijah . He tucked his cloak into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab 's chariot all the way to the entrance of Jezreel .
