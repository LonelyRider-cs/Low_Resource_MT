11:12:001:1	The Northern Tribes Revolt
11:12:001:0	Rehoboam went to Shechem , where all Israel had gathered to make him king .
11:12:002:0	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this , he returned from Egypt , for he had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon .
11:12:003:0	The leaders of Israel summoned him , and Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel went to speak with Rehoboam .
11:12:004:0	“ Your father was a hard master , ” they said . “ Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us . Then we will be your loyal subjects . ”
11:12:005:0	Rehoboam replied , “ Give me three days to think this over . Then come back for my answer. ” So the people went away .
11:12:006:0	Then King Rehoboam discussed the matter with the older men who had counseled his father , Solomon . “ What is your advice ? ” he asked . “ How should I answer these people ? ”
11:12:007:0	The older counselors replied , “ If you are willing to be a servant to these people today and give them a favorable answer , they will always be your loyal subjects . ”
11:12:008:0	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisers .
11:12:009:0	“ What is your advice ? ” he asked them . “ How should I answer these people who want me to lighten the burdens imposed by my father ? ”
11:12:010:0	The young men replied , “ This is what you should tell those complainers who want a lighter burden : ‘ My little finger is thicker than my father 's waist !
11:12:011:0	Yes , my father laid heavy burdens on you , but I 'm going to make them even heavier ! My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with scorpions ! ' ”
11:12:012:0	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to hear Rehoboam 's decision , just as the king had ordered .
11:12:013:0	But Rehoboam spoke harshly to the people , for he rejected the advice of the older counselors
11:12:014:0	and followed the counsel of his younger advisers . He told the people , “ My father laid heavy burdens on you , but I 'm going to make them even heavier ! My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with scorpions ! ”
11:12:015:0	So the king paid no attention to the people . This turn of events was the will of the Lord , for it fulfilled the Lord 's message to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh .
11:12:016:0	When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them , they responded , “ Down with the dynasty of David ! We have no interest in the son of Jesse.Back to your homes , O Israel ! Look out for your own house , O David ! ” So the people of Israel returned home .
11:12:017:0	But Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah .
11:12:018:0	King Rehoboam sent Adoniram , who was in charge of forced labor , to restore order , but the people of Israel stoned him to death . When this news reached King Rehoboam , he quickly jumped into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem .
11:12:019:0	And to this day the northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David .
11:12:002:1	Shemaiah 's Prophecy
11:12:020:0	When the people of Israel learned of Jeroboam 's return from Egypt , they called an assembly and made him king over all Israel . So only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the family of David .
11:12:021:0	When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem , he mobilized the men of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin — 180,000 select troops — to fight against the men of Israel and to restore the kingdom to himself .
11:12:022:0	But God said to Shemaiah , the man of God ,
11:12:023:0	“ Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all the people of Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people ,
11:12:003:1	Jeroboam Makes Gold Calves
11:12:024:0	‘ This is what the Lord says : Do not fight against your relatives , the Israelites . Go back home , for what has happened is my doing ! ' ” So they obeyed the message of the Lord and went home , as the Lord had commanded .
11:12:025:0	Jeroboam then built up the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and it became his capital . Later he went and built up the town of Peniel .
11:12:026:0	Jeroboam thought to himself , “ Unless I am careful , the kingdom will return to the dynasty of David .
11:12:027:0	When these people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Temple of the Lord , they will again give their allegiance to King Rehoboam of Judah . They will kill me and make him their king instead . ”
11:12:028:0	So on the advice of his counselors , the king made two gold calves . He said to the people , “ It is too much trouble for you to worship in Jerusalem . Look , Israel , these are the gods who brought you out of Egypt ! ”
11:12:029:0	He placed these calf idols in Bethel and in Dan — at either end of his kingdom .
11:12:030:0	But this became a great sin , for the people worshiped the idols , traveling as far north as Dan to worship the one there .
11:12:031:0	Jeroboam also erected buildings at the pagan shrines and ordained priests from the common people — those who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi .
11:12:032:0	And Jeroboam instituted a religious festival in Bethel , held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , in imitation of the annual Festival of Shelters in Judah . There at Bethel he himself offered sacrifices to the calves he had made , and he appointed priests for the pagan shrines he had made .
11:12:033:0	So on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , a day that he himself had designated , Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar at Bethel . He instituted a religious festival for Israel , and he went up to the altar to burn incense .
