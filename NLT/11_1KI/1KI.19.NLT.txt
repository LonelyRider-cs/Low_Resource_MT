11:19:001:1	Elijah Flees to Sinai
11:19:001:0	When Ahab got home , he told Jezebel everything Elijah had done , including the way he had killed all the prophets of Baal .
11:19:002:0	So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah : “ May the gods strike me and even kill me if by this time tomorrow I have not killed you just as you killed them . ”
11:19:003:0	Elijah was afraid and fled for his life . He went to Beersheba , a town in Judah , and he left his servant there .
11:19:004:0	Then he went on alone into the wilderness , traveling all day . He sat down under a solitary broom tree and prayed that he might die . “ I have had enough , Lord , ” he said . “ Take my life , for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died . ”
11:19:005:0	Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree . But as he was sleeping , an angel touched him and told him , “ Get up and eat ! ”
11:19:006:0	He looked around and there beside his head was some bread baked on hot stones and a jar of water ! So he ate and drank and lay down again .
11:19:007:0	Then the angel of the Lord came again and touched him and said , “ Get up and eat some more , or the journey ahead will be too much for you . ”
11:19:008:0	So he got up and ate and drank , and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai , the mountain of God .
11:19:002:1	The
11:19:003:1	Lord
11:19:004:1	Speaks to Elijah
11:19:009:0	There he came to a cave , where he spent the night.But the Lord said to him , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
11:19:010:0	Elijah replied , “ I have zealously served the Lord God Almighty . But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you , torn down your altars , and killed every one of your prophets . I am the only one left , and now they are trying to kill me , too . ”
11:19:011:0	“ Go out and stand before me on the mountain , ” the Lord told him . And as Elijah stood there , the Lord passed by , and a mighty windstorm hit the mountain . It was such a terrible blast that the rocks were torn loose , but the Lord was not in the wind . After the wind there was an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
11:19:012:0	And after the earthquake there was a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire . And after the fire there was the sound of a gentle whisper .
11:19:013:0	When Elijah heard it , he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.And a voice said , “ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ”
11:19:014:0	He replied again , “ I have zealously served the Lord God Almighty . But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you , torn down your altars , and killed every one of your prophets . I am the only one left , and now they are trying to kill me , too . ”
11:19:015:0	Then the Lord told him , “ Go back the same way you came , and travel to the wilderness of Damascus . When you arrive there , anoint Hazael to be king of Aram .
11:19:016:0	Then anoint Jehu grandson of Nimshi to be king of Israel , and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from the town of Abel-meholah to replace you as my prophet .
11:19:017:0	Anyone who escapes from Hazael will be killed by Jehu , and those who escape Jehu will be killed by Elisha !
11:19:005:1	The Call of Elisha
11:19:018:0	Yet I will preserve 7,000 others in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed him ! ”
11:19:019:0	So Elijah went and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing a field . There were twelve teams of oxen in the field , and Elisha was plowing with the twelfth team . Elijah went over to him and threw his cloak across his shoulders and then walked away .
11:19:020:0	Elisha left the oxen standing there , ran after Elijah , and said to him , “ First let me go and kiss my father and mother good-bye , and then I will go with you ! ” Elijah replied , “ Go on back , but think about what I have done to you . ”
11:19:021:0	So Elisha returned to his oxen and slaughtered them . He used the wood from the plow to build a fire to roast their flesh . He passed around the meat to the townspeople , and they all ate . Then he went with Elijah as his assistant .
