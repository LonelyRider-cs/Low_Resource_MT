11:6:001:1	Solomon Builds the Temple
11:6:001:0	It was in midspring , in the month of Ziv , during the fourth year of Solomon 's reign , that he began to construct the Temple of the Lord . This was 480 years after the people of Israel were rescued from their slavery in the land of Egypt .
11:6:002:0	The Temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was 90 feet long , 30 feet wide , and 45 feet high .
11:6:003:0	The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet wide , running across the entire width of the Temple . It projected outward 15 feet from the front of the Temple .
11:6:004:0	Solomon also made narrow recessed windows throughout the Temple .
11:6:005:0	He built a complex of rooms against the outer walls of the Temple , all the way around the sides and rear of the building .
11:6:006:0	The complex was three stories high , the bottom floor being 71/2 feet wide , the second floor 9 feet wide , and the top floor 101/2 feet wide . The rooms were connected to the walls of the Temple by beams resting on ledges built out from the wall . So the beams were not inserted into the walls themselves .
11:6:007:0	The stones used in the construction of the Temple were finished at the quarry , so there was no sound of hammer , ax , or any other iron tool at the building site .
11:6:008:0	The entrance to the bottom floor was on the south side of the Temple . There were winding stairs going up to the second floor , and another flight of stairs between the second and third floors .
11:6:009:0	After completing the Temple structure , Solomon put in a ceiling made of cedar beams and planks .
11:6:010:0	As already stated , he built a complex of rooms along the sides of the building , attached to the Temple walls by cedar timbers . Each story of the complex was 71/2 feet high .
11:6:011:0	Then the Lord gave this message to Solomon :
11:6:012:0	“ Concerning this Temple you are building , if you keep all my decrees and regulations and obey all my commands , I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father , David .
11:6:002:1	The Temple 's Interior
11:6:013:0	I will live among the Israelites and will never abandon my people Israel . ”
11:6:014:0	So Solomon finished building the Temple .
11:6:015:0	The entire inside , from floor to ceiling , was paneled with wood . He paneled the walls and ceilings with cedar , and he used planks of cypress for the floors .
11:6:016:0	He partitioned off an inner sanctuary — the Most Holy Place — at the far end of the Temple . It was 30 feet deep and was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling .
11:6:017:0	The main room of the Temple , outside the Most Holy Place , was 60 feet long .
11:6:018:0	Cedar paneling completely covered the stone walls throughout the Temple , and the paneling was decorated with carvings of gourds and open flowers .
11:6:019:0	He prepared the inner sanctuary at the far end of the Temple , where the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant would be placed .
11:6:020:0	This inner sanctuary was 30 feet long , 30 feet wide , and 30 feet high . He overlaid the inside with solid gold . He also overlaid the altar made of cedar .
11:6:021:0	Then Solomon overlaid the rest of the Temple 's interior with solid gold , and he made gold chains to protect the entrance to the Most Holy Place .
11:6:022:0	So he finished overlaying the entire Temple with gold , including the altar that belonged to the Most Holy Place .
11:6:023:0	He made two cherubim of wild olive wood , each 15 feet tall , and placed them in the inner sanctuary .
11:6:024:0	The wingspan of each of the cherubim was 15 feet , each wing being 71/2 feet long .
11:6:025:0	The two cherubim were identical in shape and size ;
11:6:026:0	each was 15 feet tall .
11:6:027:0	He placed them side by side in the inner sanctuary of the Temple . Their outspread wings reached from wall to wall , while their inner wings touched at the center of the room .
11:6:028:0	He overlaid the two cherubim with gold .
11:6:029:0	He decorated all the walls of the inner sanctuary and the main room with carvings of cherubim , palm trees , and open flowers .
11:6:030:0	He overlaid the floor in both rooms with gold .
11:6:031:0	For the entrance to the inner sanctuary , he made double doors of wild olive wood with five-sided doorposts .
11:6:032:0	These double doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim , palm trees , and open flowers . The doors , including the decorations of cherubim and palm trees , were overlaid with gold .
11:6:033:0	Then he made four-sided doorposts of wild olive wood for the entrance to the Temple .
11:6:034:0	There were two folding doors of cypress wood , and each door was hinged to fold back upon itself .
11:6:035:0	These doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim , palm trees , and open flowers — all overlaid evenly with gold .
11:6:036:0	The walls of the inner courtyard were built so that there was one layer of cedar beams between every three layers of finished stone .
11:6:037:0	The foundation of the Lord 's Temple was laid in midspring , in the month of Ziv , during the fourth year of Solomon 's reign .
11:6:038:0	The entire building was completed in every detail by midautumn , in the month of Bul , during the eleventh year of his reign . So it took seven years to build the Temple .
