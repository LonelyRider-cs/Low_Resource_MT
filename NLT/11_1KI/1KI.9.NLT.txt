11:9:001:1	The
11:9:002:1	Lord
11:9:003:1	's Response to Solomon
11:9:001:0	So Solomon finished building the Temple of the Lord , as well as the royal palace . He completed everything he had planned to do .
11:9:002:0	Then the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time , as he had done before at Gibeon .
11:9:003:0	The Lord said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and your petition . I have set this Temple apart to be holy—this place you have built where my name will be honored forever . I will always watch over it , for it is dear to my heart .
11:9:004:0	“ As for you , if you will follow me with integrity and godliness , as David your father did , obeying all my commands , decrees , and regulations ,
11:9:005:0	then I will establish the throne of your dynasty over Israel forever . For I made this promise to your father , David : ‘ One of your descendants will always sit on the throne of Israel . '
11:9:006:0	“ But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the commands and decrees I have given you , and if you serve and worship other gods ,
11:9:007:0	then I will uproot Israel from this land that I have given them . I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name . I will make Israel an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations .
11:9:008:0	And though this Temple is impressive now , all who pass by will be appalled and will gasp in horror . They will ask , ‘ Why did the Lord do such terrible things to this land and to this Temple ? '
11:9:004:1	Solomon 's Agreement with Hiram
11:9:009:0	“ And the answer will be , ‘ Because his people abandoned the Lord their God , who brought their ancestors out of Egypt , and they worshiped other gods instead and bowed down to them . That is why the Lord has brought all these disasters on them . ' ”
11:9:010:0	It took Solomon twenty years to build the Lord 's Temple and his own royal palace . At the end of that time ,
11:9:011:0	he gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to King Hiram of Tyre . ( Hiram had previously provided all the cedar and cypress timber and gold that Solomon had requested . )
11:9:012:0	But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him , he was not at all pleased with them .
11:9:013:0	“ What kind of towns are these , my brother ? ” he asked . So Hiram called that area Cabul ( which means “ worthless ” ) , as it is still known today .
11:9:005:1	Solomon 's Many Achievements
11:9:014:0	Nevertheless , Hiram paid Solomon 9,000 pounds of gold .
11:9:015:0	This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the Lord 's Temple , the royal palace , the supporting terraces , the wall of Jerusalem , and the cities of Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer .
11:9:016:0	( Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , had attacked and captured Gezer , killing the Canaanite population and burning it down . He gave the city to his daughter as a wedding gift when she married Solomon .
11:9:017:0	So Solomon rebuilt the city of Gezer . ) He also built up the towns of Lower Beth-horon ,
11:9:018:0	Baalath , and Tamar in the wilderness within his land .
11:9:019:0	He built towns as supply centers and constructed towns where his chariots and horses could be stationed . He built everything he desired in Jerusalem and Lebanon and throughout his entire realm .
11:9:020:0	There were still some people living in the land who were not Israelites , including Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
11:9:021:0	These were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not completely destroyed . So Solomon conscripted them as slaves , and they serve as forced laborers to this day .
11:9:022:0	But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for forced labor . Instead , he assigned them to serve as fighting men , government officials , officers and captains in his army , commanders of his chariots , and charioteers .
11:9:023:0	Solomon appointed 550 of them to supervise the people working on his various projects .
11:9:024:0	Solomon moved his wife , Pharaoh 's daughter , from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her . Then he constructed the supporting terraces .
11:9:025:0	Three times each year Solomon presented burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord . He also burned incense to the Lord . And so he finished the work of building the Temple .
11:9:026:0	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber , a port near Elath in the land of Edom , along the shore of the Red Sea .
11:9:027:0	Hiram sent experienced crews of sailors to sail the ships with Solomon 's men .
11:9:028:0	They sailed to Ophir and brought back to Solomon some sixteen tons of gold .
