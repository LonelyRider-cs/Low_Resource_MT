11:16:001:0	This message from the Lord was delivered to King Baasha by the prophet Jehu son of Hanani :
11:16:002:0	“ I lifted you out of the dust to make you ruler of my people Israel , but you have followed the evil example of Jeroboam . You have provoked my anger by causing my people Israel to sin .
11:16:003:0	So now I will destroy you and your family , just as I destroyed the descendants of Jeroboam son of Nebat .
11:16:004:0	The members of Baasha 's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures . ”
11:16:005:0	The rest of the events in Baasha 's reign and the extent of his power are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
11:16:006:0	When Baasha died , he was buried in Tirzah . Then his son Elah became the next king .
11:16:001:1	Elah Rules in Israel
11:16:007:0	The message from the Lord against Baasha and his family came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani . It was delivered because Baasha had done what was evil in the Lord 's sight ( just as the family of Jeroboam had done ) , and also because Baasha had destroyed the family of Jeroboam . The Lord 's anger was provoked by Baasha 's sins .
11:16:008:0	Elah son of Baasha began to rule over Israel in the twenty-sixth year of King Asa 's reign in Judah . He reigned in the city of Tirzah for two years .
11:16:009:0	Then Zimri , who commanded half of the royal chariots , made plans to kill him . One day in Tirzah , Elah was getting drunk at the home of Arza , the supervisor of the palace .
11:16:010:0	Zimri walked in and struck him down and killed him . This happened in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa 's reign in Judah . Then Zimri became the next king .
11:16:011:0	Zimri immediately killed the entire royal family of Baasha , leaving him not even a single male child . He even destroyed distant relatives and friends .
11:16:012:0	So Zimri destroyed the dynasty of Baasha as the Lord had promised through the prophet Jehu .
11:16:013:0	This happened because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed , and because of the sins they led Israel to commit . They provoked the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel , with their worthless idols .
11:16:002:1	Zimri Rules in Israel
11:16:014:0	The rest of the events in Elah 's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
11:16:015:0	Zimri began to rule over Israel in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa 's reign in Judah , but his reign in Tirzah lasted only seven days . The army of Israel was then attacking the Philistine town of Gibbethon .
11:16:016:0	When they heard that Zimri had committed treason and had assassinated the king , that very day they chose Omri , commander of the army , as the new king of Israel .
11:16:017:0	So Omri led the entire army of Israel up from Gibbethon to attack Tirzah , Israel 's capital .
11:16:018:0	When Zimri saw that the city had been taken , he went into the citadel of the palace and burned it down over himself and died in the flames .
11:16:019:0	For he , too , had done what was evil in the Lord 's sight . He followed the example of Jeroboam in all the sins he had committed and led Israel to commit .
11:16:003:1	Omri Rules in Israel
11:16:020:0	The rest of the events in Zimri 's reign and his conspiracy are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
11:16:021:0	But now the people of Israel were split into two factions . Half the people tried to make Tibni son of Ginath their king , while the other half supported Omri .
11:16:022:0	But Omri 's supporters defeated the supporters of Tibni . So Tibni was killed , and Omri became the next king .
11:16:023:0	Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-first year of King Asa 's reign in Judah . He reigned twelve years in all , six of them in Tirzah .
11:16:024:0	Then Omri bought the hill now known as Samaria from its owner , Shemer , for 150 pounds of silver . He built a city on it and called the city Samaria in honor of Shemer .
11:16:025:0	But Omri did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , even more than any of the kings before him .
11:16:026:0	He followed the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat in all the sins he had committed and led Israel to commit . The people provoked the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel , with their worthless idols .
11:16:027:0	The rest of the events in Omri 's reign , the extent of his power , and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
11:16:004:1	Ahab Rules in Israel
11:16:028:0	When Omri died , he was buried in Samaria . Then his son Ahab became the next king .
11:16:029:0	Ahab son of Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa 's reign in Judah . He reigned in Samaria twenty-two years .
11:16:030:0	But Ahab son of Omri did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , even more than any of the kings before him .
11:16:031:0	And as though it were not enough to follow the sinful example of Jeroboam , he married Jezebel , the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians , and he began to bow down in worship of Baal .
11:16:032:0	First Ahab built a temple and an altar for Baal in Samaria .
11:16:033:0	Then he set up an Asherah pole . He did more to provoke the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel , than any of the other kings of Israel before him .
11:16:034:0	It was during his reign that Hiel , a man from Bethel , rebuilt Jericho . When he laid its foundations , it cost him the life of his oldest son , Abiram . And when he completed it and set up its gates , it cost him the life of his youngest son , Segub . This all happened according to the message from the Lord concerning Jericho spoken by Joshua son of Nun .
