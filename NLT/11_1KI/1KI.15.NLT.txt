He sent it with some of his officials to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon , son of Hezion , the king of Aram , who was ruling in Damascus , along with this message :
11:15:019:0	“ Let there be a treaty between you and me like the one between your father and my father . See , I am sending you a gift of silver and gold . Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone . ”
