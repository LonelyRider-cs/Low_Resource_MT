11:1:001:1	David in His Old Age
11:1:001:0	King David was now very old , and no matter how many blankets covered him , he could not keep warm .
11:1:002:0	So his advisers told him , “ Let us find a young virgin to wait on you and look after you , my lord . She will lie in your arms and keep you warm . ”
11:1:003:0	So they searched throughout the land of Israel for a beautiful girl , and they found Abishag from Shunem and brought her to the king .
11:1:002:1	Adonijah Claims the Throne
11:1:004:0	The girl was very beautiful , and she looked after the king and took care of him . But the king had no sexual relations with her .
11:1:005:0	About that time David 's son Adonijah , whose mother was Haggith , began boasting , “ I will make myself king. ” So he provided himself with chariots and charioteers and recruited fifty men to run in front of him .
11:1:006:0	Now his father , King David , had never disciplined him at any time , even by asking , “ Why are you doing that ? ” Adonijah had been born next after Absalom , and he was very handsome .
11:1:007:0	Adonijah took Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest into his confidence , and they agreed to help him become king .
11:1:008:0	But Zadok the priest , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , Nathan the prophet , Shimei , Rei , and David 's personal bodyguard refused to support Adonijah .
11:1:009:0	Adonijah went to the Stone of Zoheleth near the spring of En-rogel , where he sacrificed sheep , cattle , and fattened calves . He invited all his brothers — the other sons of King David — and all the royal officials of Judah .
11:1:010:0	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king 's bodyguard or his brother Solomon .
11:1:011:0	Then Nathan went to Bathsheba , Solomon 's mother , and asked her , “ Have n't you heard that Haggith 's son , Adonijah , has made himself king , and our lord David does n't even know about it ?
11:1:012:0	If you want to save your own life and the life of your son Solomon , follow my advice .
11:1:013:0	Go at once to King David and say to him , ‘ My lord the king , did n't you make a vow and say to me , “ Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne ” ? Why then has Adonijah become king ? '
11:1:014:0	And while you are still talking with him , I will come and confirm everything you have said . ”
11:1:015:0	So Bathsheba went into the king 's bedroom . ( He was very old now , and Abishag was taking care of him . )
11:1:016:0	Bathsheba bowed down before the king. “ What can I do for you ? ” he asked her .
11:1:017:0	She replied , “ My lord , you made a vow before the Lord your God when you said to me , ‘ Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne . '
11:1:018:0	But instead , Adonijah has made himself king , and my lord the king does not even know about it .
11:1:019:0	He has sacrificed many cattle , fattened calves , and sheep , and he has invited all the king 's sons to attend the celebration . He also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab , the commander of the army . But he did not invite your servant Solomon .
11:1:020:0	And now , my lord the king , all Israel is waiting for you to announce who will become king after you .
11:1:021:0	If you do not act , my son Solomon and I will be treated as criminals as soon as my lord the king has died . ”
11:1:022:0	While she was still speaking with the king , Nathan the prophet arrived .
11:1:023:0	The king 's officials told him , “ Nathan the prophet is here to see you. ” Nathan went in and bowed before the king with his face to the ground .
11:1:024:0	Nathan asked , “ My lord the king , have you decided that Adonijah will be the next king and that he will sit on your throne ?
11:1:025:0	Today he has sacrificed many cattle , fattened calves , and sheep , and he has invited all the king 's sons to attend the celebration . He also invited the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest . They are feasting and drinking with him and shouting , ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! '
11:1:026:0	But he did not invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or your servant Solomon .
11:1:003:1	David Makes Solomon King
11:1:027:0	Has my lord the king really done this without letting any of his officials know who should be the next king ? ”
11:1:028:0	King David responded , “ Call Bathsheba ! ” So she came back in and stood before the king .
11:1:029:0	And the king repeated his vow : “ As surely as the Lord lives , who has rescued me from every danger ,
11:1:030:0	your son Solomon will be the next king and will sit on my throne this very day , just as I vowed to you before the Lord , the God of Israel . ”
11:1:031:0	Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground before the king and exclaimed , “ May my lord King David live forever ! ”
11:1:032:0	Then King David ordered , “ Call Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah son of Jehoiada. ” When they came into the king 's presence ,
11:1:033:0	the king said to them , “ Take Solomon and my officials down to Gihon Spring . Solomon is to ride on my own mule .
11:1:034:0	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel . Blow the ram 's horn and shout , ‘ Long live King Solomon ! '
11:1:035:0	Then escort him back here , and he will sit on my throne . He will succeed me as king , for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah . ”
11:1:036:0	“ Amen ! ” Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied . “ May the Lord , the God of my lord the king , decree that it happen .
11:1:037:0	And may the Lord be with Solomon as he has been with you , my lord the king , and may he make Solomon 's reign even greater than yours ! ”
11:1:038:0	So Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and the king 's bodyguard took Solomon down to Gihon Spring , with Solomon riding on King David 's own mule .
11:1:039:0	There Zadok the priest took the flask of olive oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon with the oil . Then they sounded the ram 's horn and all the people shouted , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
11:1:040:0	And all the people followed Solomon into Jerusalem , playing flutes and shouting for joy . The celebration was so joyous and noisy that the earth shook with the sound .
11:1:041:0	Adonijah and his guests heard the celebrating and shouting just as they were finishing their banquet . When Joab heard the sound of the ram 's horn , he asked , “ What 's going on ? Why is the city in such an uproar ? ”
11:1:042:0	And while he was still speaking , Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived . “ Come in , ” Adonijah said to him , “ for you are a good man . You must have good news . ”
11:1:043:0	“ Not at all ! ” Jonathan replied . “ Our lord King David has just declared Solomon king !
11:1:044:0	The king sent him down to Gihon Spring with Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah son of Jehoiada , protected by the king 's bodyguard . They had him ride on the king 's own mule ,
11:1:045:0	and Zadok and Nathan have anointed him at Gihon Spring as the new king . They have just returned , and the whole city is celebrating and rejoicing . That 's what all the noise is about .
11:1:046:0	What 's more , Solomon is now sitting on the royal throne as king .
11:1:047:0	And all the royal officials have gone to King David and congratulated him , saying , ‘ May your God make Solomon 's fame even greater than your own , and may Solomon 's reign be even greater than yours ! ' Then the king bowed his head in worship as he lay in his bed ,
11:1:048:0	and he said , ‘ Praise the Lord , the God of Israel , who today has chosen a successor to sit on my throne while I am still alive to see it . ' ”
11:1:049:0	Then all of Adonijah 's guests jumped up in panic from the banquet table and quickly scattered .
11:1:050:0	Adonijah was afraid of Solomon , so he rushed to the sacred tent and grabbed on to the horns of the altar .
11:1:051:0	Word soon reached Solomon that Adonijah had seized the horns of the altar in fear , and that he was pleading , “ Let King Solomon swear today that he will not kill me ! ”
11:1:052:0	Solomon replied , “ If he proves himself to be loyal , not a hair on his head will be touched . But if he makes trouble , he will die . ”
11:1:053:0	So King Solomon summoned Adonijah , and they brought him down from the altar . He came and bowed respectfully before King Solomon , who dismissed him , saying , “ Go on home . ”
