11:21:001:1	Naboth 's Vineyard
11:21:001:0	Now there was a man named Naboth , from Jezreel , who owned a vineyard in Jezreel beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria .
11:21:002:0	One day Ahab said to Naboth , “ Since your vineyard is so convenient to my palace , I would like to buy it to use as a vegetable garden . I will give you a better vineyard in exchange , or if you prefer , I will pay you for it . ”
11:21:003:0	But Naboth replied , “ The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance that was passed down by my ancestors . ”
11:21:004:0	So Ahab went home angry and sullen because of Naboth 's answer . The king went to bed with his face to the wall and refused to eat !
11:21:005:0	“ What 's the matter ? ” his wife Jezebel asked him . “ What 's made you so upset that you 're not eating ? ”
11:21:006:0	“ I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or trade it , but he refused ! ” Ahab told her .
11:21:007:0	“ Are you the king of Israel or not ? ” Jezebel demanded . “ Get up and eat something , and do n't worry about it . I 'll get you Naboth 's vineyard ! ”
11:21:008:0	So she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , sealed them with his seal , and sent them to the elders and other leaders of the town where Naboth lived .
11:21:009:0	In her letters she commanded : “ Call the citizens together for a time of fasting , and give Naboth a place of honor .
11:21:010:0	And then seat two scoundrels across from him who will accuse him of cursing God and the king . Then take him out and stone him to death . ”
11:21:011:0	So the elders and other town leaders followed the instructions Jezebel had written in the letters .
11:21:012:0	They called for a fast and put Naboth at a prominent place before the people .
11:21:013:0	Then the two scoundrels came and sat down across from him . And they accused Naboth before all the people , saying , “ He cursed God and the king. ” So he was dragged outside the town and stoned to death .
11:21:014:0	The town leaders then sent word to Jezebel , “ Naboth has been stoned to death . ”
11:21:015:0	When Jezebel heard the news , she said to Ahab , “ You know the vineyard Naboth would n't sell you ? Well , you can have it now ! He 's dead ! ”
11:21:016:0	So Ahab immediately went down to the vineyard of Naboth to claim it .
11:21:017:0	But the Lord said to Elijah ,
11:21:018:0	“ Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel , who rules in Samaria . He will be at Naboth 's vineyard in Jezreel , claiming it for himself .
11:21:019:0	Give him this message : ‘ This is what the Lord says : Was n't it enough that you killed Naboth ? Must you rob him , too ? Because you have done this , dogs will lick your blood at the very place where they licked the blood of Naboth ! ' ”
11:21:020:0	“ So , my enemy , you have found me ! ” Ahab exclaimed to Elijah. “ Yes , ” Elijah answered , “ I have come because you have sold yourself to what is evil in the Lord 's sight .
11:21:021:0	So now the Lord says , ‘ I will bring disaster on you and consume you . I will destroy every one of your male descendants , slave and free alike , anywhere in Israel !
11:21:022:0	I am going to destroy your family as I did the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and the family of Baasha son of Ahijah , for you have made me very angry and have led Israel into sin . '
11:21:023:0	“ And regarding Jezebel , the Lord says , ‘ Dogs will eat Jezebel 's body at the plot of land in Jezreel . '
11:21:024:0	“ The members of Ahab 's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures . ”
11:21:025:0	( No one else so completely sold himself to what was evil in the Lord 's sight as Ahab did under the influence of his wife Jezebel .
11:21:026:0	His worst outrage was worshiping idols just as the Amorites had done—the people whom the Lord had driven out from the land ahead of the Israelites . )
11:21:027:0	But when Ahab heard this message , he tore his clothing , dressed in burlap , and fasted . He even slept in burlap and went about in deep mourning .
11:21:028:0	Then another message from the Lord came to Elijah :
11:21:029:0	“ Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me ? Because he has done this , I will not do what I promised during his lifetime . It will happen to his sons ; I will destroy his dynasty . ”
