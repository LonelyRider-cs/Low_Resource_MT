11:3:001:1	Solomon Asks for Wisdom
11:3:001:0	Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and married one of his daughters . He brought her to live in the City of David until he could finish building his palace and the Temple of the Lord and the wall around the city .
11:3:002:0	At that time the people of Israel sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship , for a temple honoring the name of the Lord had not yet been built .
11:3:003:0	Solomon loved the Lord and followed all the decrees of his father , David , except that Solomon , too , offered sacrifices and burned incense at the local places of worship .
11:3:004:0	The most important of these places of worship was at Gibeon , so the king went there and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings .
11:3:005:0	That night the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream , and God said , “ What do you want ? Ask , and I will give it to you ! ”
11:3:006:0	Solomon replied , “ You showed great and faithful love to your servant my father , David , because he was honest and true and faithful to you . And you have continued to show this great and faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne .
11:3:007:0	“ Now , O Lord my God , you have made me king instead of my father , David , but I am like a little child who does n't know his way around .
11:3:008:0	And here I am in the midst of your own chosen people , a nation so great and numerous they can not be counted !
11:3:009:0	Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong . For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours ? ”
11:3:010:0	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for wisdom .
11:3:011:0	So God replied , “ Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies—
11:3:012:0	I will give you what you asked for ! I will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have !
11:3:013:0	And I will also give you what you did not ask for—riches and fame ! No other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life !
11:3:014:0	And if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father , David , did , I will give you a long life . ”
11:3:002:1	Solomon Judges Wisely
11:3:015:0	Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream . He returned to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Lord 's Covenant , where he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings . Then he invited all his officials to a great banquet .
11:3:016:0	Some time later two prostitutes came to the king to have an argument settled .
11:3:017:0	“ Please , my lord , ” one of them began , “ this woman and I live in the same house . I gave birth to a baby while she was with me in the house .
11:3:018:0	Three days later this woman also had a baby . We were alone ; there were only two of us in the house .
11:3:019:0	“ But her baby died during the night when she rolled over on it .
11:3:020:0	Then she got up in the night and took my son from beside me while I was asleep . She laid her dead child in my arms and took mine to sleep beside her .
11:3:021:0	And in the morning when I tried to nurse my son , he was dead ! But when I looked more closely in the morning light , I saw that it was n't my son at all . ”
11:3:022:0	Then the other woman interrupted , “ It certainly was your son , and the living child is mine. ” “ No , ” the first woman said , “ the living child is mine , and the dead one is yours. ” And so they argued back and forth before the king .
11:3:023:0	Then the king said , “ Let 's get the facts straight . Both of you claim the living child is yours , and each says that the dead one belongs to the other .
11:3:024:0	All right , bring me a sword. ” So a sword was brought to the king .
11:3:025:0	Then he said , “ Cut the living child in two , and give half to one woman and half to the other ! ”
11:3:026:0	Then the woman who was the real mother of the living child , and who loved him very much , cried out , “ Oh no , my lord ! Give her the child—please do not kill him ! ” But the other woman said , “ All right , he will be neither yours nor mine ; divide him between us ! ”
11:3:027:0	Then the king said , “ Do not kill the child , but give him to the woman who wants him to live , for she is his mother ! ”
11:3:028:0	When all Israel heard the king 's decision , the people were in awe of the king , for they saw the wisdom God had given him for rendering justice .
