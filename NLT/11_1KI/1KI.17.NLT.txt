11:17:001:1	Elijah Fed by Ravens
11:17:001:0	Now Elijah , who was from Tishbe in Gilead , told King Ahab , “ As surely as the Lord , the God of Israel , lives—the God I serve—there will be no dew or rain during the next few years until I give the word ! ”
11:17:002:0	Then the Lord said to Elijah ,
11:17:003:0	“ Go to the east and hide by Kerith Brook , near where it enters the Jordan River .
11:17:004:0	Drink from the brook and eat what the ravens bring you , for I have commanded them to bring you food . ”
11:17:005:0	So Elijah did as the Lord told him and camped beside Kerith Brook , east of the Jordan .
11:17:006:0	The ravens brought him bread and meat each morning and evening , and he drank from the brook .
11:17:002:1	The Widow at Zarephath
11:17:007:0	But after a while the brook dried up , for there was no rainfall anywhere in the land .
11:17:008:0	Then the Lord said to Elijah ,
11:17:009:0	“ Go and live in the village of Zarephath , near the city of Sidon . I have instructed a widow there to feed you . ”
11:17:010:0	So he went to Zarephath . As he arrived at the gates of the village , he saw a widow gathering sticks , and he asked her , “ Would you please bring me a little water in a cup ? ”
11:17:011:0	As she was going to get it , he called to her , “ Bring me a bite of bread , too . ”
11:17:012:0	But she said , “ I swear by the Lord your God that I do n't have a single piece of bread in the house . And I have only a handful of flour left in the jar and a little cooking oil in the bottom of the jug . I was just gathering a few sticks to cook this last meal , and then my son and I will die . ”
11:17:013:0	But Elijah said to her , “ Do n't be afraid ! Go ahead and do just what you 've said , but make a little bread for me first . Then use what 's left to prepare a meal for yourself and your son .
11:17:014:0	For this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : There will always be flour and olive oil left in your containers until the time when the Lord sends rain and the crops grow again ! ”
11:17:015:0	So she did as Elijah said , and she and Elijah and her family continued to eat for many days .
11:17:016:0	There was always enough flour and olive oil left in the containers , just as the Lord had promised through Elijah .
11:17:017:0	Some time later the woman 's son became sick . He grew worse and worse , and finally he died .
11:17:018:0	Then she said to Elijah , “ O man of God , what have you done to me ? Have you come here to point out my sins and kill my son ? ”
11:17:019:0	But Elijah replied , “ Give me your son. ” And he took the child 's body from her arms , carried him up the stairs to the room where he was staying , and laid the body on his bed .
11:17:020:0	Then Elijah cried out to the Lord , “ O Lord my God , why have you brought tragedy to this widow who has opened her home to me , causing her son to die ? ”
11:17:021:0	And he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to the Lord , “ O Lord my God , please let this child 's life return to him . ”
11:17:022:0	The Lord heard Elijah 's prayer , and the life of the child returned , and he revived !
11:17:023:0	Then Elijah brought him down from the upper room and gave him to his mother . “ Look ! ” he said . “ Your son is alive ! ”
11:17:024:0	Then the woman told Elijah , “ Now I know for sure that you are a man of God , and that the Lord truly speaks through you . ”
