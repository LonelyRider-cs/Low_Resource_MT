11:10:001:1	Visit of the Queen of Sheba
11:10:001:0	When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon 's fame , which brought honor to the name of the Lord , she came to test him with hard questions .
11:10:002:0	She arrived in Jerusalem with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices , large quantities of gold , and precious jewels . When she met with Solomon , she talked with him about everything she had on her mind .
11:10:003:0	Solomon had answers for all her questions ; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her .
11:10:004:0	When the queen of Sheba realized how very wise Solomon was , and when she saw the palace he had built ,
11:10:005:0	she was overwhelmed . She was also amazed at the food on his tables , the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing , the cup-bearers , and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the Lord .
11:10:006:0	She exclaimed to the king , “ Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true !
11:10:007:0	I did n't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes . In fact , I had not heard the half of it ! Your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond what I was told .
11:10:008:0	How happy your people must be ! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day , listening to your wisdom !
11:10:009:0	Praise the Lord your God , who delights in you and has placed you on the throne of Israel . Because of the Lord 's eternal love for Israel , he has made you king so you can rule with justice and righteousness . ”
11:10:010:0	Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds of gold , great quantities of spices , and precious jewels . Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
11:10:011:0	( In addition , Hiram 's ships brought gold from Ophir , and they also brought rich cargoes of red sandalwood and precious jewels .
11:10:012:0	The king used the sandalwood to make railings for the Temple of the Lord and the royal palace , and to construct lyres and harps for the musicians . Never before or since has there been such a supply of sandalwood . )
11:10:002:1	Solomon 's Wealth and Splendor
11:10:013:0	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for , besides all the customary gifts he had so generously given . Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land .
11:10:014:0	Each year Solomon received about 25 tons of gold .
11:10:015:0	This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders , all the kings of Arabia , and the governors of the land .
11:10:016:0	King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold , each weighing more than fifteen pounds .
11:10:017:0	He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold , each weighing nearly four pounds . The king placed these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon .
11:10:018:0	Then the king made a huge throne , decorated with ivory and overlaid with fine gold .
11:10:019:0	The throne had six steps and a rounded back . There were armrests on both sides of the seat , and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne .
11:10:020:0	There were also twelve other lions , one standing on each end of the six steps . No other throne in all the world could be compared with it !
11:10:021:0	All of King Solomon 's drinking cups were solid gold , as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon . They were not made of silver , for silver was considered worthless in Solomon 's day !
11:10:022:0	The king had a fleet of trading ships of Tarshish that sailed with Hiram 's fleet . Once every three years the ships returned , loaded with gold , silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks .
11:10:023:0	So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth .
11:10:024:0	People from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him .
11:10:025:0	Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold , clothing , weapons , spices , horses , and mules .
11:10:026:0	Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses . He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses . He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem .
11:10:027:0	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone . And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah .
11:10:028:0	Solomon 's horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia ; the king 's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price .
11:10:029:0	At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver , and horses for 150 pieces of silver . They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram .
