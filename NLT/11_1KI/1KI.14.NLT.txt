11:14:001:1	Ahijah 's Prophecy against Jeroboam
11:14:001:0	At that time Jeroboam 's son Abijah became very sick .
11:14:002:0	So Jeroboam told his wife , “ Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you as my wife . Then go to the prophet Ahijah at Shiloh—the man who told me I would become king .
11:14:003:0	Take him a gift of ten loaves of bread , some cakes , and a jar of honey , and ask him what will happen to the boy . ”
11:14:004:0	So Jeroboam 's wife went to Ahijah 's home at Shiloh . He was an old man now and could no longer see .
11:14:005:0	But the Lord had told Ahijah , “ Jeroboam 's wife will come here , pretending to be someone else . She will ask you about her son , for he is very sick . Give her the answer I give you . ”
11:14:006:0	So when Ahijah heard her footsteps at the door , he called out , “ Come in , wife of Jeroboam ! Why are you pretending to be someone else ? ” Then he told her , “ I have bad news for you .
11:14:007:0	Give your husband , Jeroboam , this message from the Lord , the God of Israel : ‘ I promoted you from the ranks of the common people and made you ruler over my people Israel .
11:14:008:0	I ripped the kingdom away from the family of David and gave it to you . But you have not been like my servant David , who obeyed my commands and followed me with all his heart and always did whatever I wanted .
11:14:009:0	You have done more evil than all who lived before you . You have made other gods for yourself and have made me furious with your gold calves . And since you have turned your back on me ,
11:14:010:0	I will bring disaster on your dynasty and will destroy every one of your male descendants , slave and free alike , anywhere in Israel . I will burn up your royal dynasty as one burns up trash until it is all gone .
11:14:011:0	The members of Jeroboam 's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures . I , the Lord , have spoken . ' ”
11:14:012:0	Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam 's wife , “ Go on home , and when you enter the city , the child will die .
11:14:013:0	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him . He is the only member of your family who will have a proper burial , for this child is the only good thing that the Lord , the God of Israel , sees in the entire family of Jeroboam .
11:14:014:0	“ In addition , the Lord will raise up a king over Israel who will destroy the family of Jeroboam . This will happen today , even now !
11:14:015:0	Then the Lord will shake Israel like a reed whipped about in a stream . He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land that he gave their ancestors and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River , for they have angered the Lord with the Asherah poles they have set up for worship .
11:14:016:0	He will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and made Israel sin along with him . ”
11:14:017:0	So Jeroboam 's wife returned to Tirzah , and the child died just as she walked through the door of her home .
11:14:018:0	And all Israel buried him and mourned for him , as the Lord had promised through the prophet Ahijah .
11:14:019:0	The rest of the events in Jeroboam 's reign , including all his wars and how he ruled , are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel .
11:14:002:1	Rehoboam Rules in Judah
11:14:020:0	Jeroboam reigned in Israel twenty-two years . When Jeroboam died , his son Nadab became the next king .
11:14:021:0	Meanwhile , Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah . He was forty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city the Lord had chosen from among all the tribes of Israel as the place to honor his name . Rehoboam 's mother was Naamah , an Ammonite woman .
11:14:022:0	During Rehoboam 's reign , the people of Judah did what was evil in the Lord 's sight , provoking his anger with their sin , for it was even worse than that of their ancestors .
11:14:023:0	For they also built for themselves pagan shrines and set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree .
11:14:024:0	There were even male and female shrine prostitutes throughout the land . The people imitated the detestable practices of the pagan nations the Lord had driven from the land ahead of the Israelites .
11:14:025:0	In the fifth year of King Rehoboam 's reign , King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem .
11:14:026:0	He ransacked the treasuries of the Lord 's Temple and the royal palace ; he stole everything , including all the gold shields Solomon had made .
11:14:027:0	King Rehoboam later replaced them with bronze shields as substitutes , and he entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace .
11:14:028:0	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the Lord , the guards would also take the shields and then return them to the guardroom .
11:14:029:0	The rest of the events in Rehoboam 's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah .
11:14:030:0	There was constant war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam .
11:14:031:0	When Rehoboam died , he was buried among his ancestors in the City of David . His mother was Naamah , an Ammonite woman . Then his son Abijam became the next king .
