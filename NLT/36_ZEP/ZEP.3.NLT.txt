36:3:001:1	Jerusalem 's Rebellion and Redemption
36:3:001:0	What sorrow awaits rebellious , polluted Jerusalem , the city of violence and crime !
36:3:002:0	No one can tell it anything ; it refuses all correction.It does not trust in the Lordor draw near to its God .
36:3:003:0	Its leaders are like roaring lionshunting for their victims.Its judges are like ravenous wolves at evening time , who by dawn have left no trace of their prey .
36:3:004:0	Its prophets are arrogant liars seeking their own gain.Its priests defile the Temple by disobeying God 's instructions .
36:3:005:0	But the Lord is still there in the city , and he does no wrong.Day by day he hands down justice , and he does not fail.But the wicked know no shame .
36:3:006:0	“ I have wiped out many nations , devastating their fortress walls and towers.Their streets are now deserted ; their cities lie in silent ruin.There are no survivors—none at all .
36:3:007:0	I thought , ‘ Surely they will have reverence for me now ! Surely they will listen to my warnings.Then I wo n't need to strike again , destroying their homes . 'But no , they get up earlyto continue their evil deeds .
36:3:008:0	Therefore , be patient , ” says the Lord. “ Soon I will stand and accuse these evil nations.For I have decided to gather the kingdoms of the earthand pour out my fiercest anger and fury on them.All the earth will be devouredby the fire of my jealousy .
36:3:009:0	“ Then I will purify the speech of all people , so that everyone can worship the Lord together .
36:3:010:0	My scattered people who live beyond the rivers of Ethiopiawill come to present their offerings .
36:3:011:0	On that day you will no longer need to be ashamed , for you will no longer be rebels against me.I will remove all proud and arrogant people from among you.There will be no more haughtiness on my holy mountain .
36:3:012:0	Those who are left will be the lowly and humble , for it is they who trust in the name of the Lord .
36:3:013:0	The remnant of Israel will do no wrong ; they will never tell lies or deceive one another.They will eat and sleep in safety , and no one will make them afraid . ”
36:3:014:0	Sing , O daughter of Zion ; shout aloud , O Israel ! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart , O daughter of Jerusalem !
36:3:015:0	For the Lord will remove his hand of judgmentand will disperse the armies of your enemy.And the Lord himself , the King of Israel , will live among you ! At last your troubles will be over , and you will never again fear disaster .
36:3:016:0	On that day the announcement to Jerusalem will be , “ Cheer up , Zion ! Do n't be afraid !
36:3:017:0	For the Lord your God is living among you.He is a mighty savior.He will take delight in you with gladness.With his love , he will calm all your fears.He will rejoice over you with joyful songs . ”
36:3:018:0	“ I will gather you who mourn for the appointed festivals ; you will be disgraced no more .
36:3:019:0	And I will deal severely with all who have oppressed you.I will save the weak and helpless ones ; I will bring togetherthose who were chased away.I will give glory and fame to my former exiles , wherever they have been mocked and shamed .
36:3:020:0	On that day I will gather you togetherand bring you home again.I will give you a good name , a name of distinction , among all the nations of the earth , as I restore your fortunes before their very eyes.I , the Lord , have spoken ! ”
