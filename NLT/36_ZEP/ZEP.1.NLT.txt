36:1:001:0	The Lord gave this message to Zephaniah when Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah . Zephaniah was the son of Cushi , son of Gedaliah , son of Amariah , son of Hezekiah .
36:1:002:0	“ I will sweep away everythingfrom the face of the earth , ” says the Lord .
36:1:003:0	“ I will sweep away people and animals alike.I will sweep away the birds of the sky and the fish in the sea.I will reduce the wicked to heaps of rubble , and I will wipe humanity from the face of the earth , ” says the Lord .
36:1:004:0	“ I will crush Judah and Jerusalem with my fistand destroy every last trace of their Baal worship.I will put an end to all the idolatrous priests , so that even the memory of them will disappear .
36:1:005:0	For they go up to their roofsand bow down to the sun , moon , and stars.They claim to follow the Lord , but then they worship Molech , too .
36:1:006:0	And I will destroy those who used to worship mebut now no longer do.They no longer ask for the Lord 's guidanceor seek my blessings . ”
36:1:007:0	Stand in silence in the presence of the Sovereign Lord , for the awesome day of the Lord 's judgment is near.The Lord has prepared his people for a great slaughterand has chosen their executioners .
36:1:008:0	“ On that day of judgment , ” says the Lord , “ I will punish the leaders and princes of Judahand all those following pagan customs .
36:1:009:0	Yes , I will punish those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies , and those who fill their masters ' houses with violence and deceit .
36:1:010:0	“ On that day , ” says the Lord , “ a cry of alarm will come from the Fish Gateand echo throughout the New Quarter of the city.And a great crash will sound from the hills .
36:1:011:0	Wail in sorrow , all you who live in the market area , for all the merchants and traders will be destroyed .
36:1:012:0	“ I will search with lanterns in Jerusalem 's darkest cornersto punish those who sit complacent in their sins.They think the Lord will do nothing to them , either good or bad .
36:1:013:0	So their property will be plundered , their homes will be ransacked.They will build new homesbut never live in them.They will plant vineyardsbut never drink wine from them .
36:1:014:0	“ That terrible day of the Lord is near.Swiftly it comes—a day of bitter tears , a day when even strong men will cry out .
36:1:015:0	It will be a day when the Lord 's anger is poured out—a day of terrible distress and anguish , a day of ruin and desolation , a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and blackness ,
36:1:016:0	a day of trumpet calls and battle cries.Down go the walled citiesand the strongest battlements !
36:1:017:0	“ Because you have sinned against the Lord , I will make you grope around like the blind.Your blood will be poured into the dust , and your bodies will lie rotting on the ground . ”
36:1:018:0	Your silver and gold will not save youon that day of the Lord 's anger.For the whole land will be devouredby the fire of his jealousy.He will make a terrifying endof all the people on earth .
