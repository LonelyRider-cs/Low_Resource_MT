22:5:001:0	I have entered my garden , my treasure , my bride ! I gather myrrh with my spicesand eat honeycomb with my honey.I drink wine with my milk.Oh , lover and beloved , eat and drink ! Yes , drink deeply of your love !
22:5:002:0	I slept , but my heart was awake , when I heard my lover knocking and calling : “ Open to me , my treasure , my darling , my dove , my perfect one.My head is drenched with dew , my hair with the dampness of the night . ”
22:5:003:0	But I responded , “ I have taken off my robe.Should I get dressed again ? I have washed my feet.Should I get them soiled ? ”
22:5:004:0	My lover tried to unlatch the door , and my heart thrilled within me .
22:5:005:0	I jumped up to open the door for my love , and my hands dripped with perfume.My fingers dripped with lovely myrrhas I pulled back the bolt .
22:5:006:0	I opened to my lover , but he was gone ! My heart sank.I searched for himbut could not find him anywhere.I called to him , but there was no reply .
22:5:007:0	The night watchmen found meas they made their rounds.They beat and bruised meand stripped off my veil , those watchmen on the walls .
