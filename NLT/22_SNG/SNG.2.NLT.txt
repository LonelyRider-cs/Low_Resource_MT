22:2:002:1	Young Man
22:2:001:0	I am the spring crocus blooming on the Sharon Plain , the lily of the valley .
22:2:003:1	Young Woman
22:2:002:0	Like a lily among thistlesis my darling among young women .
22:2:003:0	Like the finest apple tree in the orchardis my lover among other young men.I sit in his delightful shadeand taste his delicious fruit .
22:2:004:0	He escorts me to the banquet hall ; it 's obvious how much he loves me .
22:2:005:0	Strengthen me with raisin cakes , refresh me with apples , for I am weak with love .
22:2:006:0	His left arm is under my head , and his right arm embraces me .
22:2:007:0	Promise me , O women of Jerusalem , by the gazelles and wild deer , not to awaken love until the time is right .
22:2:008:0	Ah , I hear my lover coming ! He is leaping over the mountains , bounding over the hills .
22:2:009:0	My lover is like a swift gazelleor a young stag.Look , there he is behind the wall , looking through the window , peering into the room .
22:2:010:0	My lover said to me , “ Rise up , my darling ! Come away with me , my fair one !
22:2:011:0	Look , the winter is past , and the rains are over and gone .
22:2:012:0	The flowers are springing up , the season of singing birds has come , and the cooing of turtledoves fills the air .
22:2:004:1	Young Man
22:2:013:0	The fig trees are forming young fruit , and the fragrant grapevines are blossoming.Rise up , my darling ! Come away with me , my fair one ! ”
22:2:005:1	Young Women of Jerusalem
22:2:014:0	My dove is hiding behind the rocks , behind an outcrop on the cliff.Let me see your face ; let me hear your voice.For your voice is pleasant , and your face is lovely .
22:2:006:1	Young Woman
22:2:015:0	Catch all the foxes , those little foxes , before they ruin the vineyard of love , for the grapevines are blossoming !
22:2:016:0	My lover is mine , and I am his.He browses among the lilies .
22:2:017:0	Before the dawn breezes blowand the night shadows flee , return to me , my love , like a gazelleor a young stag on the rugged mountains .
