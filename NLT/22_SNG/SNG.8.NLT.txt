22:8:001:1	Young Woman
22:8:001:0	Oh , I wish you were my brother , who nursed at my mother 's breasts.Then I could kiss you no matter who was watching , and no one would criticize me .
22:8:002:0	I would bring you to my childhood home , and there you would teach me.I would give you spiced wine to drink , my sweet pomegranate wine .
22:8:003:0	Your left arm would be under my head , and your right arm would embrace me .
22:8:002:1	Young Women of Jerusalem
22:8:004:0	Promise me , O women of Jerusalem , not to awaken love until the time is right .
22:8:003:1	Young Woman
22:8:005:0	Who is this sweeping in from the desert , leaning on her lover ? I aroused you under the apple tree , where your mother gave you birth , where in great pain she delivered you .
22:8:006:0	Place me like a seal over your heart , like a seal on your arm.For love is as strong as death , its jealousy as enduring as the grave.Love flashes like fire , the brightest kind of flame .
22:8:004:1	The Young Woman 's Brothers
22:8:007:0	Many waters can not quench love , nor can rivers drown it.If a man tried to buy lovewith all his wealth , his offer would be utterly scorned .
22:8:008:0	We have a little sistertoo young to have breasts.What will we do for our sisterif someone asks to marry her ?
22:8:005:1	Young Woman
22:8:009:0	If she is a virgin , like a wall , we will protect her with a silver tower.But if she is promiscuous , like a swinging door , we will block her door with a cedar bar .
22:8:010:0	I was a virgin , like a wall ; now my breasts are like towers.When my lover looks at me , he is delighted with what he sees .
22:8:011:0	Solomon has a vineyard at Baal-hamon , which he leases out to tenant farmers.Each of them pays a thousand pieces of silverfor harvesting its fruit .
22:8:006:1	Young Man
22:8:012:0	But my vineyard is mine to give , and Solomon need not pay a thousand pieces of silver.But I will give two hundred piecesto those who care for its vines .
22:8:007:1	Young Woman
22:8:013:0	O my darling , lingering in the gardens , your companions are fortunate to hear your voice.Let me hear it , too !
22:8:014:0	Come away , my love ! Be like a gazelleor a young stag on the mountains of spices .
