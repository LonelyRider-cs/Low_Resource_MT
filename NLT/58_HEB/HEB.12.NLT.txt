58:12:001:1	God 's Discipline Proves His Love
58:12:001:0	Therefore , since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith , let us strip off every weight that slows us down , especially the sin that so easily trips us up . And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us .
58:12:002:0	We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus , the champion who initiates and perfects our faith . Because of the joy awaiting him , he endured the cross , disregarding its shame . Now he is seated in the place of honor beside God 's throne .
58:12:003:0	Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people ; then you wo n't become weary and give up .
58:12:004:0	After all , you have not yet given your lives in your struggle against sin .
58:12:005:0	And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children ? He said , “ My child , do n't make light of the Lord 's discipline , and do n't give up when he corrects you .
58:12:006:0	For the Lord disciplines those he loves , and he punishes each one he accepts as his child . ”
58:12:007:0	As you endure this divine discipline , remember that God is treating you as his own children . Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father ?
58:12:008:0	If God does n't discipline you as he does all of his children , it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all .
58:12:009:0	Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us , should n't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits , and live forever ?
58:12:010:0	For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years , doing the best they knew how . But God 's discipline is always good for us , so that we might share in his holiness .
58:12:011:0	No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening — it 's painful ! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way .
58:12:012:0	So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees .
58:12:002:1	A Call to Listen to God
58:12:013:0	Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong .
58:12:014:0	Work at living in peace with everyone , and work at living a holy life , for those who are not holy will not see the Lord .
58:12:015:0	Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God . Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you , corrupting many .
58:12:016:0	Make sure that no one is immoral or godless like Esau , who traded his birthright as the firstborn son for a single meal .
58:12:017:0	You know that afterward , when he wanted his father 's blessing , he was rejected . It was too late for repentance , even though he begged with bitter tears .
58:12:018:0	You have not come to a physical mountain , to a place of flaming fire , darkness , gloom , and whirlwind , as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai .
58:12:019:0	For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking .
58:12:020:0	They staggered back under God 's command : “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned to death . ”
58:12:021:0	Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said , “ I am terrified and trembling . ”
58:12:022:0	No , you have come to Mount Zion , to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering .
58:12:023:0	You have come to the assembly of God 's firstborn children , whose names are written in heaven . You have come to God himself , who is the judge over all things . You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect .
58:12:024:0	You have come to Jesus , the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people , and to the sprinkled blood , which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel .
58:12:025:0	Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking . For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses , the earthly messenger , we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven !
58:12:026:0	When God spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth , but now he makes another promise : “ Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also . ”
58:12:027:0	This means that all of creation will be shaken and removed , so that only unshakable things will remain .
58:12:028:0	Since we are receiving a Kingdom that is unshakable , let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe .
58:12:029:0	For our God is a devouring fire .
