58:4:001:1	Promised Rest for God 's People
58:4:001:0	God 's promise of entering his rest still stands , so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to experience it .
58:4:002:0	For this good news — that God has prepared this rest — has been announced to us just as it was to them . But it did them no good because they did n't share the faith of those who listened to God .
58:4:003:0	For only we who believe can enter his rest . As for the others , God said , “ In my anger I took an oath : ‘ They will never enter my place of rest , ' ” even though this rest has been ready since he made the world .
58:4:004:0	We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures where it mentions the seventh day : “ On the seventh day God rested from all his work . ”
58:4:005:0	But in the other passage God said , “ They will never enter my place of rest . ”
58:4:006:0	So God 's rest is there for people to enter , but those who first heard this good news failed to enter because they disobeyed God .
58:4:007:0	So God set another time for entering his rest , and that time is today . God announced this through David much later in the words already quoted : “ Today when you hear his voice , do n't harden your hearts . ”
58:4:008:0	Now if Joshua had succeeded in giving them this rest , God would not have spoken about another day of rest still to come .
58:4:009:0	So there is a special rest still waiting for the people of God .
58:4:010:0	For all who have entered into God 's rest have rested from their labors , just as God did after creating the world .
58:4:011:0	So let us do our best to enter that rest . But if we disobey God , as the people of Israel did , we will fall .
58:4:012:0	For the word of God is alive and powerful . It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword , cutting between soul and spirit , between joint and marrow . It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires .
58:4:002:1	Christ Is Our High Priest
58:4:013:0	Nothing in all creation is hidden from God . Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes , and he is the one to whom we are accountable .
58:4:014:0	So then , since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold firmly to what we believe .
58:4:015:0	This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses , for he faced all of the same testings we do , yet he did not sin .
58:4:016:0	So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God . There we will receive his mercy , and we will find grace to help us when we need it most .
