58:3:001:1	Jesus Is Greater Than Moses
58:3:001:0	And so , dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and are partners with those called to heaven , think carefully about this Jesus whom we declare to be God 's messenger and High Priest .
58:3:002:0	For he was faithful to God , who appointed him , just as Moses served faithfully when he was entrusted with God 's entire house .
58:3:003:0	But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses , just as a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself .
58:3:004:0	For every house has a builder , but the one who built everything is God .
58:3:005:0	Moses was certainly faithful in God 's house as a servant . His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later .
58:3:006:0	But Christ , as the Son , is in charge of God 's entire house . And we are God 's house , if we keep our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ .
58:3:007:0	That is why the Holy Spirit says , “ Today when you hear his voice ,
58:3:008:0	do n't harden your heartsas Israel did when they rebelled , when they tested me in the wilderness .
58:3:009:0	There your ancestors tested and tried my patience , even though they saw my miracles for forty years .
58:3:010:0	So I was angry with them , and I said , ‘ Their hearts always turn away from me.They refuse to do what I tell them . '
58:3:011:0	So in my anger I took an oath : ‘ They will never enter my place of rest . ' ”
58:3:012:0	Be careful then , dear brothers and sisters . Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving , turning you away from the living God .
58:3:013:0	You must warn each other every day , while it is still “ today , ” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God .
58:3:014:0	For if we are faithful to the end , trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed , we will share in all that belongs to Christ .
58:3:015:0	Remember what it says : “ Today when you hear his voice , do n't harden your heartsas Israel did when they rebelled . ”
58:3:016:0	And who was it who rebelled against God , even though they heard his voice ? Was n't it the people Moses led out of Egypt ?
58:3:017:0	And who made God angry for forty years ? Was n't it the people who sinned , whose corpses lay in the wilderness ?
58:3:018:0	And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest ? Was n't it the people who disobeyed him ?
58:3:019:0	So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest .
