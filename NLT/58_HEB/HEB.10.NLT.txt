58:10:001:1	Christ 's Sacrifice Once for All
58:10:001:0	The old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow , a dim preview of the good things to come , not the good things themselves . The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again , year after year , but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship .
58:10:002:0	If they could have provided perfect cleansing , the sacrifices would have stopped , for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time , and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared .
58:10:003:0	But instead , those sacrifices actually reminded them of their sins year after year .
58:10:004:0	For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58:10:005:0	That is why , when Christ came into the world , he said to God , “ You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings.But you have given me a body to offer .
58:10:006:0	You were not pleased with burnt offeringsor other offerings for sin .
58:10:007:0	Then I said , ‘ Look , I have come to do your will , O God — as is written about me in the Scriptures . ' ”
58:10:008:0	First , Christ said , “ You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings or burnt offerings or other offerings for sin , nor were you pleased with them ” ( though they are required by the law of Moses ) .
58:10:009:0	Then he said , “ Look , I have come to do your will. ” He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect .
58:10:010:0	For God 's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ , once for all time .
58:10:011:0	Under the old covenant , the priest stands and ministers before the altar day after day , offering the same sacrifices again and again , which can never take away sins .
58:10:012:0	But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins , good for all time . Then he sat down in the place of honor at God 's right hand .
58:10:013:0	There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet .
58:10:014:0	For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy .
58:10:015:0	And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so . For he says ,
58:10:016:0	“ This is the new covenant I will makewith my people on that day , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their hearts , and I will write them on their minds . ”
58:10:017:0	Then he says , “ I will never again remembertheir sins and lawless deeds . ”
58:10:002:1	A Call to Persevere
58:10:018:0	And when sins have been forgiven , there is no need to offer any more sacrifices .
58:10:019:0	And so , dear brothers and sisters , we can boldly enter heaven 's Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus .
58:10:020:0	By his death , Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place .
58:10:021:0	And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God 's house ,
58:10:022:0	let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts fully trusting him . For our guilty consciences have been sprinkled with Christ 's blood to make us clean , and our bodies have been washed with pure water .
58:10:023:0	Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm , for God can be trusted to keep his promise .
58:10:024:0	Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works .
58:10:025:0	And let us not neglect our meeting together , as some people do , but encourage one another , especially now that the day of his return is drawing near .
58:10:026:0	Dear friends , if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth , there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins .
58:10:027:0	There is only the terrible expectation of God 's judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies .
58:10:028:0	For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58:10:029:0	Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God , and have treated the blood of the covenant , which made us holy , as if it were common and unholy , and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God 's mercy to us .
58:10:030:0	For we know the one who said , “ I will take revenge.I will pay them back. ” He also said , “ The Lord will judge his own people . ”
58:10:031:0	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58:10:032:0	Think back on those early days when you first learned about Christ . Remember how you remained faithful even though it meant terrible suffering .
58:10:033:0	Sometimes you were exposed to public ridicule and were beaten , and sometimes you helped others who were suffering the same things .
58:10:034:0	You suffered along with those who were thrown into jail , and when all you owned was taken from you , you accepted it with joy . You knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever .
58:10:035:0	So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord . Remember the great reward it brings you !
58:10:036:0	Patient endurance is what you need now , so that you will continue to do God 's will . Then you will receive all that he has promised .
58:10:037:0	“ For in just a little while , the Coming One will come and not delay .
58:10:038:0	And my righteous ones will live by faith.But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away . ”
58:10:039:0	But we are not like those who turn away from God to their own destruction . We are the faithful ones , whose souls will be saved .
