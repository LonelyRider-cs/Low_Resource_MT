58:13:001:1	Concluding Words
58:13:001:0	Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters .
58:13:002:0	Do n't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for some who have done this have entertained angels without realizing it !
58:13:003:0	Remember those in prison , as if you were there yourself . Remember also those being mistreated , as if you felt their pain in your own bodies .
58:13:004:0	Give honor to marriage , and remain faithful to one another in marriage . God will surely judge people who are immoral and those who commit adultery .
58:13:005:0	Do n't love money ; be satisfied with what you have . For God has said , “ I will never fail you.I will never abandon you . ”
58:13:006:0	So we can say with confidence , “ The Lord is my helper , so I will have no fear.What can mere people do to me ? ”
58:13:007:0	Remember your leaders who taught you the word of God . Think of all the good that has come from their lives , and follow the example of their faith .
58:13:008:0	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58:13:009:0	So do not be attracted by strange , new ideas . Your strength comes from God 's grace , not from rules about food , which do n't help those who follow them .
58:13:010:0	We have an altar from which the priests in the Tabernacle have no right to eat .
58:13:011:0	Under the old system , the high priest brought the blood of animals into the Holy Place as a sacrifice for sin , and the bodies of the animals were burned outside the camp .
58:13:012:0	So also Jesus suffered and died outside the city gates to make his people holy by means of his own blood .
58:13:013:0	So let us go out to him , outside the camp , and bear the disgrace he bore .
58:13:014:0	For this world is not our permanent home ; we are looking forward to a home yet to come .
58:13:015:0	Therefore , let us offer through Jesus a continual sacrifice of praise to God , proclaiming our allegiance to his name .
58:13:016:0	And do n't forget to do good and to share with those in need . These are the sacrifices that please God .
58:13:017:0	Obey your spiritual leaders , and do what they say . Their work is to watch over your souls , and they are accountable to God . Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow . That would certainly not be for your benefit .
58:13:018:0	Pray for us , for our conscience is clear and we want to live honorably in everything we do .
58:13:019:0	And especially pray that I will be able to come back to you soon .
58:13:020:0	Now may the God of peace — who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus , the great Shepherd of the sheep , and ratified an eternal covenant with his blood —
58:13:021:0	may he equip you with all you needfor doing his will.May he produce in you , through the power of Jesus Christ , every good thing that is pleasing to him.All glory to him forever and ever ! Amen .
58:13:022:0	I urge you , dear brothers and sisters , to pay attention to what I have written in this brief exhortation .
58:13:023:0	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released from jail . If he comes here soon , I will bring him with me to see you .
58:13:024:0	Greet all your leaders and all the believers there . The believers from Italy send you their greetings .
58:13:025:0	May God 's grace be with you all .
