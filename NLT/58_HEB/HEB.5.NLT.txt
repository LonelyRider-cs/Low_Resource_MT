58:5:001:0	Every high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God . He presents their gifts to God and offers sacrifices for their sins .
58:5:002:0	And he is able to deal gently with ignorant and wayward people because he himself is subject to the same weaknesses .
58:5:003:0	That is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as theirs .
58:5:004:0	And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honor . He must be called by God for this work , just as Aaron was .
58:5:005:0	That is why Christ did not honor himself by assuming he could become High Priest . No , he was chosen by God , who said to him , “ You are my Son.Today I have become your Father . ”
58:5:006:0	And in another passage God said to him , “ You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . ”
58:5:007:0	While Jesus was here on earth , he offered prayers and pleadings , with a loud cry and tears , to the one who could rescue him from death . And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God .
58:5:008:0	Even though Jesus was God 's Son , he learned obedience from the things he suffered .
58:5:009:0	In this way , God qualified him as a perfect High Priest , and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him .
58:5:001:1	A Call to Spiritual Growth
58:5:010:0	And God designated him to be a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek .
58:5:011:0	There is much more we would like to say about this , but it is difficult to explain , especially since you are spiritually dull and do n't seem to listen .
58:5:012:0	You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others . Instead , you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God 's word . You are like babies who need milk and can not eat solid food .
58:5:013:0	For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and does n't know how to do what is right .
58:5:014:0	Solid food is for those who are mature , who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between right and wrong .
