58:7:001:1	Melchizedek Is Greater Than Abraham
58:7:001:0	This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High . When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against the kings , Melchizedek met him and blessed him .
58:7:002:0	Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had captured in battle and gave it to Melchizedek . The name Melchizedek means “ king of justice , ” and king of Salem means “ king of peace . ”
58:7:003:0	There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors—no beginning or end to his life . He remains a priest forever , resembling the Son of God .
58:7:004:0	Consider then how great this Melchizedek was . Even Abraham , the great patriarch of Israel , recognized this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle .
58:7:005:0	Now the law of Moses required that the priests , who are descendants of Levi , must collect a tithe from the rest of the people of Israel , who are also descendants of Abraham .
58:7:006:0	But Melchizedek , who was not a descendant of Levi , collected a tenth from Abraham . And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham , the one who had already received the promises of God .
58:7:007:0	And without question , the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed .
58:7:008:0	The priests who collect tithes are men who die , so Melchizedek is greater than they are , because we are told that he lives on .
58:7:009:0	In addition , we might even say that these Levites—the ones who collect the tithe—paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him .
58:7:010:0	For although Levi was n't born yet , the seed from which he came was in Abraham 's body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him .
58:7:011:0	So if the priesthood of Levi , on which the law was based , could have achieved the perfection God intended , why did God need to establish a different priesthood , with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron ?
58:7:012:0	And if the priesthood is changed , the law must also be changed to permit it .
58:7:013:0	For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe , whose members have never served at the altar as priests .
58:7:002:1	Jesus Is like Melchizedek
58:7:014:0	What I mean is , our Lord came from the tribe of Judah , and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe .
58:7:015:0	This change has been made very clear since a different priest , who is like Melchizedek , has appeared .
58:7:016:0	Jesus became a priest , not by meeting the physical requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi , but by the power of a life that can not be destroyed .
58:7:017:0	And the psalmist pointed this out when he prophesied , “ You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . ”
58:7:018:0	Yes , the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless .
58:7:019:0	For the law never made anything perfect . But now we have confidence in a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
58:7:020:0	This new system was established with a solemn oath . Aaron 's descendants became priests without such an oath ,
58:7:021:0	but there was an oath regarding Jesus . For God said to him , “ The Lord has taken an oath and will not break his vow : ‘ You are a priest forever . ' ”
58:7:022:0	Because of this oath , Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God .
58:7:023:0	There were many priests under the old system , for death prevented them from remaining in office .
58:7:024:0	But because Jesus lives forever , his priesthood lasts forever .
58:7:025:0	Therefore he is able , once and forever , to save those who come to God through him . He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf .
58:7:026:0	He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless , unstained by sin . He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven .
58:7:027:0	Unlike those other high priests , he does not need to offer sacrifices every day . They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people . But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people 's sins .
58:7:028:0	The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness . But after the law was given , God appointed his Son with an oath , and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever .
