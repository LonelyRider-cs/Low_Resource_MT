58:8:001:1	Christ Is Our High Priest
58:8:001:0	Here is the main point : We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven .
58:8:002:0	There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle , the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands .
58:8:003:0	And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices , our High Priest must make an offering , too .
58:8:004:0	If he were here on earth , he would not even be a priest , since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law .
58:8:005:0	They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy , a shadow of the real one in heaven . For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle , God gave him this warning : “ Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain . ”
58:8:006:0	But now Jesus , our High Priest , has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood , for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God , based on better promises .
58:8:007:0	If the first covenant had been faultless , there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it .
58:8:008:0	But when God found fault with the people , he said : “ The day is coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new covenantwith the people of Israel and Judah .
58:8:009:0	This covenant will not be like the oneI made with their ancestorswhen I took them by the handand led them out of the land of Egypt.They did not remain faithful to my covenant , so I turned my back on them , says the Lord .
58:8:010:0	But this is the new covenant I will makewith the people of Israel on that day , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their minds , and I will write them on their hearts.I will be their God , and they will be my people .
58:8:011:0	And they will not need to teach their neighbors , nor will they need to teach their relatives , saying , ‘ You should know the Lord . 'For everyone , from the least to the greatest , will know me already .
58:8:012:0	And I will forgive their wickedness , and I will never again remember their sins . ”
58:8:013:0	When God speaks of a “ new ” covenant , it means he has made the first one obsolete . It is now out of date and will soon disappear .
