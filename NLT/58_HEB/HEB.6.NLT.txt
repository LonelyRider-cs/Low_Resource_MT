58:6:001:0	So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again . Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding . Surely we do n't need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God .
58:6:002:0	You do n't need further instruction about baptisms , the laying on of hands , the resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58:6:003:0	And so , God willing , we will move forward to further understanding .
58:6:004:0	For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened — those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit ,
58:6:005:0	who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come —
58:6:006:0	and who then turn away from God . It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance ; by rejecting the Son of God , they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame .
58:6:007:0	When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer , it has God 's blessing .
58:6:008:0	But if a field bears thorns and thistles , it is useless . The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it .
58:6:009:0	Dear friends , even though we are talking this way , we really do n't believe it applies to you . We are confident that you are meant for better things , things that come with salvation .
58:6:010:0	For God is not unjust . He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers , as you still do .
58:6:011:0	Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts , in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true .
58:6:001:1	God 's Promises Bring Hope
58:6:012:0	Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent . Instead , you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God 's promises because of their faith and endurance .
58:6:013:0	For example , there was God 's promise to Abraham . Since there was no one greater to swear by , God took an oath in his own name , saying :
58:6:014:0	“ I will certainly bless you , and I will multiply your descendants beyond number . ”
58:6:015:0	Then Abraham waited patiently , and he received what God had promised .
58:6:016:0	Now when people take an oath , they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it . And without any question that oath is binding .
58:6:017:0	God also bound himself with an oath , so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind .
58:6:018:0	So God has given both his promise and his oath . These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie . Therefore , we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us .
58:6:019:0	This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls . It leads us through the curtain into God 's inner sanctuary .
58:6:020:0	Jesus has already gone in there for us . He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek .
