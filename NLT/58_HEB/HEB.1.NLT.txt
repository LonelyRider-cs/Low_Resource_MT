58:1:001:1	Jesus Christ Is God 's Son
58:1:001:0	Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets .
58:1:002:0	And now in these final days , he has spoken to us through his Son . God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance , and through the Son he created the universe .
58:1:003:0	The Son radiates God 's own glory and expresses the very character of God , and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command . When he had cleansed us from our sins , he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven .
58:1:002:1	The Son Is Greater Than the Angels
58:1:004:0	This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels , just as the name God gave him is greater than their names .
58:1:005:0	For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus : “ You are my Son.Today I have become your Father. ” God also said , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son . ”
58:1:006:0	And when he brought his supreme Son into the world , God said , “ Let all of God 's angels worship him . ”
58:1:007:0	Regarding the angels , he says , “ He sends his angels like the winds , his servants like flames of fire . ”
58:1:008:0	But to the Son he says , “ Your throne , O God , endures forever and ever.You rule with a scepter of justice .
58:1:009:0	You love justice and hate evil.Therefore , O God , your God has anointed you , pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else . ”
58:1:010:0	He also says to the Son , “ In the beginning , Lord , you laid the foundation of the earthand made the heavens with your hands .
58:1:011:0	They will perish , but you remain forever.They will wear out like old clothing .
58:1:012:0	You will fold them up like a cloakand discard them like old clothing.But you are always the same ; you will live forever . ”
58:1:013:0	And God never said to any of the angels , “ Sit in the place of honor at my right handuntil I humble your enemies , making them a footstool under your feet . ”
58:1:014:0	Therefore , angels are only servants—spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation .
