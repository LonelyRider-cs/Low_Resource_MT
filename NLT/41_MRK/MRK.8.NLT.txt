41:8:001:1	Jesus Feeds Four Thousand
41:8:001:0	About this time another large crowd had gathered , and the people ran out of food again . Jesus called his disciples and told them ,
41:8:002:0	“ I feel sorry for these people . They have been here with me for three days , and they have nothing left to eat .
41:8:003:0	If I send them home hungry , they will faint along the way . For some of them have come a long distance . ”
41:8:004:0	His disciples replied , “ How are we supposed to find enough food to feed them out here in the wilderness ? ”
41:8:005:0	Jesus asked , “ How much bread do you have ? ” “ Seven loaves , ” they replied .
41:8:006:0	So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves , thanked God for them , and broke them into pieces . He gave them to his disciples , who distributed the bread to the crowd .
41:8:007:0	A few small fish were found , too , so Jesus also blessed these and told the disciples to distribute them .
41:8:008:0	They ate as much as they wanted . Afterward , the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food .
41:8:009:0	There were about 4,000 men in the crowd that day , and Jesus sent them home after they had eaten .
41:8:002:1	Pharisees Demand a Miraculous Sign
41:8:010:0	Immediately after this , he got into a boat with his disciples and crossed over to the region of Dalmanutha .
41:8:011:0	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had arrived , they came and started to argue with him . Testing him , they demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority .
41:8:012:0	When he heard this , he sighed deeply in his spirit and said , “ Why do these people keep demanding a miraculous sign ? I tell you the truth , I will not give this generation any such sign . ”
41:8:003:1	Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod
41:8:013:0	So he got back into the boat and left them , and he crossed to the other side of the lake .
41:8:014:0	But the disciples had forgotten to bring any food . They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat .
41:8:015:0	As they were crossing the lake , Jesus warned them , “ Watch out ! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod . ”
41:8:016:0	At this they began to argue with each other because they had n't brought any bread .
41:8:017:0	Jesus knew what they were saying , so he said , “ Why are you arguing about having no bread ? Do n't you know or understand even yet ? Are your hearts too hard to take it in ?
41:8:018:0	‘ You have eyes—ca n't you see ? You have ears—ca n't you hear ? ' Do n't you remember anything at all ?
41:8:019:0	When I fed the 5,000 with five loaves of bread , how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward ? ” “ Twelve , ” they said .
41:8:020:0	“ And when I fed the 4,000 with seven loaves , how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up ? ” “ Seven , ” they said .
41:8:004:1	Jesus Heals a Blind Man
41:8:021:0	“ Do n't you understand yet ? ” he asked them .
41:8:022:0	When they arrived at Bethsaida , some people brought a blind man to Jesus , and they begged him to touch the man and heal him .
41:8:023:0	Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village . Then , spitting on the man 's eyes , he laid his hands on him and asked , “ Can you see anything now ? ”
41:8:024:0	The man looked around . “ Yes , ” he said , “ I see people , but I ca n't see them very clearly . They look like trees walking around . ”
41:8:025:0	Then Jesus placed his hands on the man 's eyes again , and his eyes were opened . His sight was completely restored , and he could see everything clearly .
41:8:005:1	Peter 's Declaration about Jesus
41:8:026:0	Jesus sent him away , saying , “ Do n't go back into the village on your way home . ”
41:8:027:0	Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi . As they were walking along , he asked them , “ Who do people say I am ? ”
41:8:028:0	“ Well , ” they replied , “ some say John the Baptist , some say Elijah , and others say you are one of the other prophets . ”
41:8:029:0	Then he asked them , “ But who do you say I am ? ” Peter replied , “ You are the Messiah . ”
41:8:006:1	Jesus Predicts His Death
41:8:030:0	But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him .
41:8:031:0	Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders , the leading priests , and the teachers of religious law . He would be killed , but three days later he would rise from the dead .
41:8:032:0	As he talked about this openly with his disciples , Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things .
41:8:033:0	Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples , then reprimanded Peter . “ Get away from me , Satan ! ” he said . “ You are seeing things merely from a human point of view , not from God 's . ”
41:8:034:0	Then , calling the crowd to join his disciples , he said , “ If any of you wants to be my follower , you must give up your own way , take up your cross , and follow me .
41:8:035:0	If you try to hang on to your life , you will lose it . But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News , you will save it .
41:8:036:0	And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul ?
41:8:037:0	Is anything worth more than your soul ?
41:8:038:0	If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days , the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . ”
