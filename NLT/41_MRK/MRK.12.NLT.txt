41:12:001:1	Parable of the Evil Farmers
41:12:001:0	Then Jesus began teaching them with stories : “ A man planted a vineyard . He built a wall around it , dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice , and built a lookout tower . Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country .
41:12:002:0	At the time of the grape harvest , he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop .
41:12:003:0	But the farmers grabbed the servant , beat him up , and sent him back empty-handed .
41:12:004:0	The owner then sent another servant , but they insulted him and beat him over the head .
41:12:005:0	The next servant he sent was killed . Others he sent were either beaten or killed ,
41:12:006:0	until there was only one left—his son whom he loved dearly . The owner finally sent him , thinking , ‘ Surely they will respect my son . '
41:12:007:0	“ But the tenant farmers said to one another , ‘ Here comes the heir to this estate . Let 's kill him and get the estate for ourselves ! '
41:12:008:0	So they grabbed him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard .
41:12:009:0	“ What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do ? ” Jesus asked . “ I 'll tell you—he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others .
41:12:010:0	Did n't you ever read this in the Scriptures ? ‘ The stone that the builders rejectedhas now become the cornerstone .
41:12:011:0	This is the 's doing , and it is wonderful to see . ' ”
41:12:002:1	Taxes for Caesar
41:12:012:0	The religious leaders wanted to arrest Jesus because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers . But they were afraid of the crowd , so they left him and went away .
41:12:013:0	Later the leaders sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested .
41:12:014:0	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ we know how honest you are . You are impartial and do n't play favorites . You teach the way of God truthfully . Now tell us—is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ?
41:12:015:0	Should we pay them , or should n't we ? ” Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Show me a Roman coin , and I 'll tell you . ”
41:12:016:0	When they handed it to him , he asked , “ Whose picture and title are stamped on it ? ” “ Caesar 's , ” they replied .
41:12:003:1	Discussion about Resurrection
41:12:017:0	“ Well , then , ” Jesus said , “ give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God. ” His reply completely amazed them .
41:12:018:0	Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead . They posed this question :
41:12:019:0	“ Teacher , Moses gave us a law that if a man dies , leaving a wife without children , his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother 's name .
41:12:020:0	Well , suppose there were seven brothers . The oldest one married and then died without children .
41:12:021:0	So the second brother married the widow , but he also died without children . Then the third brother married her .
41:12:022:0	This continued with all seven of them , and still there were no children . Last of all , the woman also died .
41:12:023:0	So tell us , whose wife will she be in the resurrection ? For all seven were married to her . ”
41:12:024:0	Jesus replied , “ Your mistake is that you do n't know the Scriptures , and you do n't know the power of God .
41:12:025:0	For when the dead rise , they will neither marry nor be given in marriage . In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven .
41:12:026:0	“ But now , as to whether the dead will be raised—have n't you ever read about this in the writings of Moses , in the story of the burning bush ? Long after Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob had died , God said to Moses , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '
41:12:004:1	The Most Important Commandment
41:12:027:0	So he is the God of the living , not the dead . You have made a serious error . ”
41:12:028:0	One of the teachers of religious law was standing there listening to the debate . He realized that Jesus had answered well , so he asked , “ Of all the commandments , which is the most important ? ”
41:12:029:0	Jesus replied , “ The most important commandment is this : ‘ Listen , O Israel ! The our God is the one and only .
41:12:030:0	And you must love the your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength . '
41:12:031:0	The second is equally important : ‘ Love your neighbor as yourself . ' No other commandment is greater than these . ”
41:12:032:0	The teacher of religious law replied , “ Well said , Teacher . You have spoken the truth by saying that there is only one God and no other .
41:12:033:0	And I know it is important to love him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength , and to love my neighbor as myself . This is more important than to offer all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law . ”
41:12:005:1	Whose Son Is the Messiah ?
41:12:034:0	Realizing how much the man understood , Jesus said to him , “ You are not far from the Kingdom of God. ” And after that , no one dared to ask him any more questions .
41:12:035:0	Later , as Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple , he asked , “ Why do the teachers of religious law claim that the Messiah is the son of David ?
41:12:036:0	For David himself , speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , said , ‘ The said to my Lord , Sit in the place of honor at my right handuntil I humble your enemies beneath your feet . '
41:12:037:0	Since David himself called the Messiah ‘ my Lord , ' how can the Messiah be his son ? ” The large crowd listened to him with great delight .
41:12:038:0	Jesus also taught : “ Beware of these teachers of religious law ! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces .
41:12:039:0	And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets .
41:12:006:1	The Widow 's Offering
41:12:040:0	Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public . Because of this , they will be more severely punished . ”
41:12:041:0	Jesus sat down near the collection box in the Temple and watched as the crowds dropped in their money . Many rich people put in large amounts .
41:12:042:0	Then a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins .
41:12:043:0	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow has given more than all the others who are making contributions .
41:12:044:0	For they gave a tiny part of their surplus , but she , poor as she is , has given everything she had to live on . ”
