41:15:001:1	Jesus ' Trial before Pilate
41:15:001:0	Very early in the morning the leading priests , the elders , and the teachers of religious law — the entire high council — met to discuss their next step . They bound Jesus , led him away , and took him to Pilate , the Roman governor .
41:15:002:0	Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus replied , “ You have said it . ”
41:15:003:0	Then the leading priests kept accusing him of many crimes ,
41:15:004:0	and Pilate asked him , “ Are n't you going to answer them ? What about all these charges they are bringing against you ? ”
41:15:005:0	But Jesus said nothing , much to Pilate 's surprise .
41:15:006:0	Now it was the governor 's custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner — anyone the people requested .
41:15:007:0	One of the prisoners at that time was Barabbas , a revolutionary who had committed murder in an uprising .
41:15:008:0	The crowd went to Pilate and asked him to release a prisoner as usual .
41:15:009:0	“ Would you like me to release to you this ‘ King of the Jews ' ? ” Pilate asked .
41:15:010:0	( For he realized by now that the leading priests had arrested Jesus out of envy . )
41:15:011:0	But at this point the leading priests stirred up the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus .
41:15:012:0	Pilate asked them , “ Then what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews ? ”
41:15:013:0	They shouted back , “ Crucify him ! ”
41:15:014:0	“ Why ? ” Pilate demanded . “ What crime has he committed ? ” But the mob roared even louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
41:15:002:1	The Soldiers Mock Jesus
41:15:015:0	So to pacify the crowd , Pilate released Barabbas to them . He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip , then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified .
41:15:016:0	The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the governor 's headquarters ( called the Praetorium ) and called out the entire regiment .
41:15:017:0	They dressed him in a purple robe , and they wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head .
41:15:018:0	Then they saluted him and taunted , “ Hail ! King of the Jews ! ”
41:15:019:0	And they struck him on the head with a reed stick , spit on him , and dropped to their knees in mock worship .
41:15:003:1	The Crucifixion
41:15:020:0	When they were finally tired of mocking him , they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again . Then they led him away to be crucified .
41:15:021:0	A passerby named Simon , who was from Cyrene , was coming in from the countryside just then , and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus ' cross . ( Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus . )
41:15:022:0	And they brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha ( which means “ Place of the Skull ” ) .
41:15:023:0	They offered him wine drugged with myrrh , but he refused it .
41:15:024:0	Then the soldiers nailed him to the cross . They divided his clothes and threw dice to decide who would get each piece .
41:15:025:0	It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him .
41:15:026:0	A sign announced the charge against him . It read , “ The King of the Jews . ”
41:15:027:0	Two revolutionaries were crucified with him , one on his right and one on his left .
41:15:029:0	The people passing by shouted abuse , shaking their heads in mockery . “ Ha ! Look at you now ! ” they yelled at him . “ You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days .
41:15:030:0	Well then , save yourself and come down from the cross ! ”
41:15:031:0	The leading priests and teachers of religious law also mocked Jesus . “ He saved others , ” they scoffed , “ but he ca n't save himself !
41:15:004:1	The Death of Jesus
41:15:032:0	Let this Messiah , this King of Israel , come down from the cross so we can see it and believe him ! ” Even the men who were crucified with Jesus ridiculed him .
41:15:033:0	At noon , darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock .
41:15:034:0	Then at three o'clock Jesus called out with a loud voice , which means “ My God , my God , why have you abandoned me ? ”
41:15:035:0	Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah .
41:15:036:0	One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine , holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink . “ Wait ! ” he said . “ Let 's see whether Elijah comes to take him down ! ”
41:15:037:0	Then Jesus uttered another loud cry and breathed his last .
41:15:038:0	And the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two , from top to bottom .
41:15:039:0	When the Roman officer who stood facing him saw how he had died , he exclaimed , “ This man truly was the Son of God ! ”
41:15:040:0	Some women were there , watching from a distance , including Mary Magdalene , Mary ( the mother of James the younger and of Joseph ) , and Salome .
41:15:005:1	The Burial of Jesus
41:15:041:0	They had been followers of Jesus and had cared for him while he was in Galilee . Many other women who had come with him to Jerusalem were also there .
41:15:042:0	This all happened on Friday , the day of preparation , the day before the Sabbath . As evening approached ,
41:15:043:0	Joseph of Arimathea took a risk and went to Pilate and asked for Jesus ' body . ( Joseph was an honored member of the high council , and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come . )
41:15:044:0	Pilate could n't believe that Jesus was already dead , so he called for the Roman officer and asked if he had died yet .
41:15:045:0	The officer confirmed that Jesus was dead , so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body .
41:15:046:0	Joseph bought a long sheet of linen cloth . Then he took Jesus ' body down from the cross , wrapped it in the cloth , and laid it in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock . Then he rolled a stone in front of the entrance .
41:15:047:0	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where Jesus ' body was laid .
