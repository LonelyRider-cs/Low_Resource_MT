41:13:001:1	Jesus Speaks about the Future
41:13:001:0	As Jesus was leaving the Temple that day , one of his disciples said , “ Teacher , look at these magnificent buildings ! Look at the impressive stones in the walls . ”
41:13:002:0	Jesus replied , “ Yes , look at these great buildings . But they will be completely demolished . Not one stone will be left on top of another ! ”
41:13:003:0	Later , Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives across the valley from the Temple . Peter , James , John , and Andrew came to him privately and asked him ,
41:13:004:0	“ Tell us , when will all this happen ? What sign will show us that these things are about to be fulfilled ? ”
41:13:005:0	Jesus replied , “ Do n't let anyone mislead you ,
41:13:006:0	for many will come in my name , claiming , ‘ I am the Messiah . ' They will deceive many .
41:13:007:0	And you will hear of wars and threats of wars , but do n't panic . Yes , these things must take place , but the end wo n't follow immediately .
41:13:008:0	Nation will go to war against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in many parts of the world , as well as famines . But this is only the first of the birth pains , with more to come .
41:13:009:0	“ When these things begin to happen , watch out ! You will be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues . You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers . But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me .
41:13:010:0	For the Good News must first be preached to all nations .
41:13:011:0	But when you are arrested and stand trial , do n't worry in advance about what to say . Just say what God tells you at that time , for it is not you who will be speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
41:13:012:0	“ A brother will betray his brother to death , a father will betray his own child , and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed .
41:13:013:0	And everyone will hate you because you are my followers . But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
41:13:014:0	“ The day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration standing where he should not be. ” ( Reader , pay attention ! ) “ Then those in Judea must flee to the hills .
41:13:015:0	A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack .
41:13:016:0	A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat .
41:13:017:0	How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days .
41:13:018:0	And pray that your flight will not be in winter .
41:13:019:0	For there will be greater anguish in those days than at any time since God created the world . And it will never be so great again .
41:13:020:0	In fact , unless the Lord shortens that time of calamity , not a single person will survive . But for the sake of his chosen ones he has shortened those days .
41:13:021:0	“ Then if anyone tells you , ‘ Look , here is the Messiah , ' or ‘ There he is , ' do n't believe it .
41:13:022:0	For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive , if possible , even God 's chosen ones .
41:13:023:0	Watch out ! I have warned you about this ahead of time !
41:13:024:0	“ At that time , after the anguish of those days , the sun will be darkened , the moon will give no light ,
41:13:025:0	the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
41:13:026:0	Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds with great power and glory .
41:13:027:0	And he will send out his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the world — from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven .
41:13:028:0	“ Now learn a lesson from the fig tree . When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout , you know that summer is near .
41:13:029:0	In the same way , when you see all these things taking place , you can know that his return is very near , right at the door .
41:13:030:0	I tell you the truth , this generation will not pass from the scene before all these things take place .
41:13:031:0	Heaven and earth will disappear , but my words will never disappear .
41:13:032:0	“ However , no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen , not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself . Only the Father knows .
41:13:033:0	And since you do n't know when that time will come , be on guard ! Stay alert !
41:13:034:0	“ The coming of the Son of Man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip . When he left home , he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do , and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return .
41:13:035:0	You , too , must keep watch ! For you do n't know when the master of the household will return — in the evening , at midnight , before dawn , or at daybreak .
41:13:036:0	Do n't let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning .
41:13:037:0	I say to you what I say to everyone : Watch for him ! ”
