41:1:001:1	John the Baptist Prepares the Way
41:1:001:0	This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah , the Son of God . It began
41:1:002:0	just as the prophet Isaiah had written : “ Look , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , and he will prepare your way .
41:1:003:0	He is a voice shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord 's coming ! Clear the road for him ! ' ”
41:1:004:0	This messenger was John the Baptist . He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven .
41:1:005:0	All of Judea , including all the people of Jerusalem , went out to see and hear John . And when they confessed their sins , he baptized them in the Jordan River .
41:1:006:0	His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair , and he wore a leather belt around his waist . For food he ate locusts and wild honey .
41:1:007:0	John announced : “ Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am — so much greater that I 'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals .
41:1:002:1	The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
41:1:008:0	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit ! ”
41:1:009:0	One day Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee , and John baptized him in the Jordan River .
41:1:010:0	As Jesus came up out of the water , he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove .
41:1:011:0	And a voice from heaven said , “ You are my dearly loved Son , and you bring me great joy . ”
41:1:012:0	The Spirit then compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness ,
41:1:013:0	where he was tempted by Satan for forty days . He was out among the wild animals , and angels took care of him .
41:1:014:0	Later on , after John was arrested , Jesus went into Galilee , where he preached God 's Good News .
41:1:003:1	The First Disciples
41:1:015:0	“ The time promised by God has come at last ! ” he announced . “ The Kingdom of God is near ! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News ! ”
41:1:016:0	One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the water , for they fished for a living .
41:1:017:0	Jesus called out to them , “ Come , follow me , and I will show you how to fish for people ! ”
41:1:018:0	And they left their nets at once and followed him .
41:1:019:0	A little farther up the shore Jesus saw Zebedee 's sons , James and John , in a boat repairing their nets .
41:1:004:1	Jesus Casts Out an Evil Spirit
41:1:020:0	He called them at once , and they also followed him , leaving their father , Zebedee , in the boat with the hired men .
41:1:021:0	Jesus and his companions went to the town of Capernaum . When the Sabbath day came , he went into the synagogue and began to teach .
41:1:022:0	The people were amazed at his teaching , for he taught with real authority — quite unlike the teachers of religious law .
41:1:023:0	Suddenly , a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out ,
41:1:024:0	“ Why are you interfering with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God ! ”
41:1:025:0	But Jesus reprimanded him . “ Be quiet ! Come out of the man , ” he ordered .
41:1:026:0	At that , the evil spirit screamed , threw the man into a convulsion , and then came out of him .
41:1:027:0	Amazement gripped the audience , and they began to discuss what had happened . “ What sort of new teaching is this ? ” they asked excitedly . “ It has such authority ! Even evil spirits obey his orders ! ”
41:1:005:1	Jesus Heals Many People
41:1:028:0	The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout the entire region of Galilee .
41:1:029:0	After Jesus left the synagogue with James and John , they went to Simon and Andrew 's home .
41:1:030:0	Now Simon 's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever . They told Jesus about her right away .
41:1:031:0	So he went to her bedside , took her by the hand , and helped her sit up . Then the fever left her , and she prepared a meal for them .
41:1:032:0	That evening after sunset , many sick and demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus .
41:1:033:0	The whole town gathered at the door to watch .
41:1:006:1	Jesus Preaches in Galilee
41:1:034:0	So Jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases , and he cast out many demons . But because the demons knew who he was , he did not allow them to speak .
41:1:035:0	Before daybreak the next morning , Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray .
41:1:036:0	Later Simon and the others went out to find him .
41:1:037:0	When they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you . ”
41:1:038:0	But Jesus replied , “ We must go on to other towns as well , and I will preach to them , too . That is why I came . ”
41:1:007:1	Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy
41:1:039:0	So he traveled throughout the region of Galilee , preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons .
41:1:040:0	A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus , begging to be healed . “ If you are willing , you can heal me and make me clean , ” he said .
41:1:041:0	Moved with compassion , Jesus reached out and touched him . “ I am willing , ” he said . “ Be healed ! ”
41:1:042:0	Instantly the leprosy disappeared , and the man was healed .
41:1:043:0	Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning :
41:1:044:0	“ Do n't tell anyone about this . Instead , go to the priest and let him examine you . Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy . This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed . ”
41:1:045:0	But the man went and spread the word , proclaiming to everyone what had happened . As a result , large crowds soon surrounded Jesus , and he could n't publicly enter a town anywhere . He had to stay out in the secluded places , but people from everywhere kept coming to him .
