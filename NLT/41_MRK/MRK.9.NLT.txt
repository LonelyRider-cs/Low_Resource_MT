41:9:001:1	The Transfiguration
41:9:001:0	Jesus went on to say , “ I tell you the truth , some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God arrive in great power ! ”
41:9:002:0	Six days later Jesus took Peter , James , and John , and led them up a high mountain to be alone . As the men watched , Jesus ' appearance was transformed ,
41:9:003:0	and his clothes became dazzling white , far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them .
41:9:004:0	Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus .
41:9:005:0	Peter exclaimed , “ Rabbi , it 's wonderful for us to be here ! Let 's make three shelters as memorials — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41:9:006:0	He said this because he did n't really know what else to say , for they were all terrified .
41:9:007:0	Then a cloud overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my dearly loved Son . Listen to him . ”
41:9:008:0	Suddenly , when they looked around , Moses and Elijah were gone , and they saw only Jesus with them .
41:9:009:0	As they went back down the mountain , he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41:9:010:0	So they kept it to themselves , but they often asked each other what he meant by “ rising from the dead . ”
41:9:011:0	Then they asked him , “ Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes ? ”
41:9:012:0	Jesus responded , “ Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready . Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt ?

41:9:013:0	But I tell you , Elijah has already come , and they chose to abuse him , just as the Scriptures predicted . ”
41:9:014:0	When they returned to the other disciples , they saw a large crowd surrounding them , and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them .
41:9:015:0	When the crowd saw Jesus , they were overwhelmed with awe , and they ran to greet him .
41:9:016:0	“ What is all this arguing about ? ” Jesus asked .
41:9:017:0	One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said , “ Teacher , I brought my son so you could heal him . He is possessed by an evil spirit that wo n't let him talk .
41:9:018:0	And whenever this spirit seizes him , it throws him violently to the ground . Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid . So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit , but they could n't do it . ”
41:9:019:0	Jesus said to them , “ You faithless people ! How long must I be with you ? How long must I put up with you ? Bring the boy to me . ”
41:9:020:0	So they brought the boy . But when the evil spirit saw Jesus , it threw the child into a violent convulsion , and he fell to the ground , writhing and foaming at the mouth .
41:9:021:0	“ How long has this been happening ? ” Jesus asked the boy 's father.He replied , “ Since he was a little boy .
41:9:022:0	The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water , trying to kill him . Have mercy on us and help us , if you can . ”
41:9:023:0	“ What do you mean , ‘ If I can ' ? ” Jesus asked . “ Anything is possible if a person believes . ”
41:9:024:0	The father instantly cried out , “ I do believe , but help me overcome my unbelief ! ”
41:9:025:0	When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing , he rebuked the evil spirit . “ Listen , you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak , ” he said . “ I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again ! ”
41:9:026:0	Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him . The boy appeared to be dead . A murmur ran through the crowd as people said , “ He 's dead . ”
41:9:027:0	But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet , and he stood up .
41:9:028:0	Afterward , when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples , they asked him , “ Why could n't we cast out that evil spirit ? ”

41:9:029:0	Jesus replied , “ This kind can be cast out only by prayer . ”
41:9:030:0	Leaving that region , they traveled through Galilee . Jesus did n't want anyone to know he was there ,
41:9:031:0	for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them . He said to them , “ The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies . He will be killed , but three days later he will rise from the dead . ”
41:9:004:1	The Greatest in the Kingdom
41:9:032:0	They did n't understand what he was saying , however , and they were afraid to ask him what he meant .
41:9:033:0	After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house , Jesus asked his disciples , “ What were you discussing out on the road ? ”
41:9:034:0	But they did n't answer , because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest .
41:9:035:0	He sat down , called the twelve disciples over to him , and said , “ Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else . ”
41:9:036:0	Then he put a little child among them . Taking the child in his arms , he said to them ,
41:9:005:1	Using the Name of Jesus
41:9:037:0	“ Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf welcomes me , and anyone who welcomes me welcomes not only me but also my Father who sent me . ”
41:9:038:0	John said to Jesus , “ Teacher , we saw someone using your name to cast out demons , but we told him to stop because he was n't in our group . ”
41:9:039:0	“ Do n't stop him ! ” Jesus said . “ No one who performs a miracle in my name will soon be able to speak evil of me .
41:9:040:0	Anyone who is not against us is for us .
41:9:041:0	If anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the Messiah , I tell you the truth , that person will surely be rewarded .
41:9:042:0	“ But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin , it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck .
41:9:043:0	If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It 's better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell with two hands .
41:9:045:0	If your foot causes you to sin , cut it off . It 's better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet .
41:9:047:0	And if your eye causes you to sin , gouge it out . It 's better to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell ,
41:9:048:0	‘ where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out . '
41:9:049:0	“ For everyone will be tested with fire .
41:9:050:0	Salt is good for seasoning . But if it loses its flavor , how do you make it salty again ? You must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other . ”
