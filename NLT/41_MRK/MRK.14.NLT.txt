41:14:001:1	Jesus Anointed at Bethany
41:14:001:0	It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread . The leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture Jesus secretly and kill him .
41:14:002:0	“ But not during the Passover celebration , ” they agreed , “ or the people may riot . ”
41:14:003:0	Meanwhile , Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon , a man who had previously had leprosy . While he was eating , a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard . She broke open the jar and poured the perfume over his head .
41:14:004:0	Some of those at the table were indignant . “ Why waste such expensive perfume ? ” they asked .
41:14:005:0	“ It could have been sold for a year 's wages and the money given to the poor ! ” So they scolded her harshly .
41:14:006:0	But Jesus replied , “ Leave her alone . Why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me ?
41:14:007:0	You will always have the poor among you , and you can help them whenever you want to . But you will not always have me .
41:14:008:0	She has done what she could and has anointed my body for burial ahead of time .
41:14:002:1	Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus
41:14:009:0	I tell you the truth , wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world , this woman 's deed will be remembered and discussed . ”
41:14:010:0	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve disciples , went to the leading priests to arrange to betray Jesus to them .
41:14:003:1	The Last Supper
41:14:011:0	They were delighted when they heard why he had come , and they promised to give him money . So he began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus .
41:14:012:0	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , when the Passover lamb is sacrificed , Jesus ' disciples asked him , “ Where do you want us to go to prepare the Passover meal for you ? ”
41:14:013:0	So Jesus sent two of them into Jerusalem with these instructions : “ As you go into the city , a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you . Follow him .
41:14:014:0	At the house he enters , say to the owner , ‘ The Teacher asks : Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? '
41:14:015:0	He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up . That is where you should prepare our meal . ”
41:14:016:0	So the two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had said , and they prepared the Passover meal there .
41:14:017:0	In the evening Jesus arrived with the Twelve .
41:14:018:0	As they were at the table eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you eating with me here will betray me . ”
41:14:019:0	Greatly distressed , each one asked in turn , “ Am I the one ? ”
41:14:020:0	He replied , “ It is one of you twelve who is eating from this bowl with me .
41:14:021:0	For the Son of Man must die , as the Scriptures declared long ago . But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him . It would be far better for that man if he had never been born ! ”
41:14:022:0	As they were eating , Jesus took some bread and blessed it . Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples , saying , “ Take it , for this is my body . ”
41:14:023:0	And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it . He gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41:14:024:0	And he said to them , “ This is my blood , which confirms the covenant between God and his people . It is poured out as a sacrifice for many .
41:14:025:0	I tell you the truth , I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God . ”
41:14:004:1	Jesus Predicts Peter 's Denial
41:14:026:0	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
41:14:027:0	On the way , Jesus told them , “ All of you will desert me . For the Scriptures say , ‘ God will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . '
41:14:028:0	But after I am raised from the dead , I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there . ”
41:14:029:0	Peter said to him , “ Even if everyone else deserts you , I never will . ”
41:14:030:0	Jesus replied , “ I tell you the truth , Peter—this very night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny three times that you even know me . ”
41:14:005:1	Jesus Prays in Gethsemane
41:14:031:0	“ No ! ” Peter declared emphatically . “ Even if I have to die with you , I will never deny you ! ” And all the others vowed the same .
41:14:032:0	They went to the olive grove called Gethsemane , and Jesus said , “ Sit here while I go and pray . ”
41:14:033:0	He took Peter , James , and John with him , and he became deeply troubled and distressed .
41:14:034:0	He told them , “ My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death . Stay here and keep watch with me . ”
41:14:035:0	He went on a little farther and fell to the ground . He prayed that , if it were possible , the awful hour awaiting him might pass him by .
41:14:036:0	“ Abba , Father , ” he cried out , “ everything is possible for you . Please take this cup of suffering away from me . Yet I want your will to be done , not mine . ”
41:14:037:0	Then he returned and found the disciples asleep . He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Could n't you watch with me even one hour ?
41:14:038:0	Keep watch and pray , so that you will not give in to temptation . For the spirit is willing , but the body is weak . ”
41:14:039:0	Then Jesus left them again and prayed the same prayer as before .
41:14:040:0	When he returned to them again , he found them sleeping , for they could n't keep their eyes open . And they did n't know what to say .
41:14:041:0	When he returned to them the third time , he said , “ Go ahead and sleep . Have your rest . But no—the time has come . The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41:14:006:1	Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested
41:14:042:0	Up , let 's be going . Look , my betrayer is here ! ”
41:14:043:0	And immediately , even as Jesus said this , Judas , one of the twelve disciples , arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs . They had been sent by the leading priests , the teachers of religious law , and the elders .
41:14:044:0	The traitor , Judas , had given them a prearranged signal : “ You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss . Then you can take him away under guard . ”
41:14:045:0	As soon as they arrived , Judas walked up to Jesus . “ Rabbi ! ” he exclaimed , and gave him the kiss .
41:14:046:0	Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
41:14:047:0	But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest 's slave , slashing off his ear .
41:14:048:0	Jesus asked them , “ Am I some dangerous revolutionary , that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me ?
41:14:049:0	Why did n't you arrest me in the Temple ? I was there among you teaching every day . But these things are happening to fulfill what the Scriptures say about me . ”
41:14:050:0	Then all his disciples deserted him and ran away .
41:14:051:0	One young man following behind was clothed only in a long linen shirt . When the mob tried to grab him ,
41:14:007:1	Jesus before the Council
41:14:052:0	he slipped out of his shirt and ran away naked .
41:14:053:0	They took Jesus to the high priest 's home where the leading priests , the elders , and the teachers of religious law had gathered .
41:14:054:0	Meanwhile , Peter followed him at a distance and went right into the high priest 's courtyard . There he sat with the guards , warming himself by the fire .
41:14:055:0	Inside , the leading priests and the entire high council were trying to find evidence against Jesus , so they could put him to death . But they could n't find any .
41:14:056:0	Many false witnesses spoke against him , but they contradicted each other .
41:14:057:0	Finally , some men stood up and gave this false testimony :
41:14:058:0	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this Temple made with human hands , and in three days I will build another , made without human hands . ' ”
41:14:059:0	But even then they did n't get their stories straight !
41:14:060:0	Then the high priest stood up before the others and asked Jesus , “ Well , are n't you going to answer these charges ? What do you have to say for yourself ? ”
41:14:061:0	But Jesus was silent and made no reply . Then the high priest asked him , “ Are you the Messiah , the Son of the Blessed One ? ”
41:14:062:0	Jesus said , “ . And you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God 's right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven . ”
41:14:063:0	Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said , “ Why do we need other witnesses ?
41:14:064:0	You have all heard his blasphemy . What is your verdict ? ” “ Guilty ! ” they all cried . “ He deserves to die ! ”
41:14:008:1	Peter Denies Jesus
41:14:065:0	Then some of them began to spit at him , and they blindfolded him and beat him with their fists . “ Prophesy to us , ” they jeered . And the guards slapped him as they took him away .
41:14:066:0	Meanwhile , Peter was in the courtyard below . One of the servant girls who worked for the high priest came by
41:14:067:0	and noticed Peter warming himself at the fire . She looked at him closely and said , “ You were one of those with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
41:14:068:0	But Peter denied it . “ I do n't know what you 're talking about , ” he said , and he went out into the entryway . Just then , a rooster crowed .
41:14:069:0	When the servant girl saw him standing there , she began telling the others , “ This man is definitely one of them ! ”
41:14:070:0	But Peter denied it again.A little later some of the other bystanders confronted Peter and said , “ You must be one of them , because you are a Galilean . ”
41:14:071:0	Peter swore , “ A curse on me if I 'm lying—I do n't know this man you 're talking about ! ”
41:14:072:0	And immediately the rooster crowed the second time.Suddenly , Jesus ' words flashed through Peter 's mind : “ Before the rooster crows twice , you will deny three times that you even know me. ” And he broke down and wept .
