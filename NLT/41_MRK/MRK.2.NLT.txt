41:2:001:1	Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man
41:2:001:0	When Jesus returned to Capernaum several days later , the news spread quickly that he was back home .
41:2:002:0	Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room , even outside the door . While he was preaching God 's word to them ,
41:2:003:0	four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat .
41:2:004:0	They could n't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd , so they dug a hole through the roof above his head . Then they lowered the man on his mat , right down in front of Jesus .
41:2:005:0	Seeing their faith , Jesus said to the paralyzed man , “ My child , your sins are forgiven . ”
41:2:006:0	But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves ,
41:2:007:0	“ What is he saying ? This is blasphemy ! Only God can forgive sins ! ”
41:2:008:0	Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking , so he asked them , “ Why do you question this in your hearts ?
41:2:009:0	Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ' or ‘ Stand up , pick up your mat , and walk ' ?
41:2:010:0	So I will prove to you that the Son of Man has the authority on earth to forgive sins. ” Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said ,
41:2:011:0	“ Stand up , pick up your mat , and go home ! ”
41:2:002:1	Jesus Calls Levi ( Matthew )
41:2:012:0	And the man jumped up , grabbed his mat , and walked out through the stunned onlookers . They were all amazed and praised God , exclaiming , “ We 've never seen anything like this before ! ”
41:2:013:0	Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him .
41:2:014:0	As he walked along , he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector 's booth . “ Follow me and be my disciple , ” Jesus said to him . So Levi got up and followed him .
41:2:015:0	Later , Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests , along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners . ( There were many people of this kind among Jesus ' followers . )
41:2:016:0	But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and other sinners , they asked his disciples , “ Why does he eat with such scum ? ”
41:2:003:1	A Discussion about Fasting
41:2:017:0	When Jesus heard this , he told them , “ Healthy people do n't need a doctor — sick people do . I have come to call not those who think they are righteous , but those who know they are sinners . ”
41:2:018:0	Once when John 's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting , some people came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do n't your disciples fast like John 's disciples and the Pharisees do ? ”
41:2:019:0	Jesus replied , “ Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom ? Of course not . They ca n't fast while the groom is with them .
41:2:020:0	But someday the groom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
41:2:021:0	“ Besides , who would patch old clothing with new cloth ? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth , leaving an even bigger tear than before .
41:2:004:1	A Discussion about the Sabbath
41:2:022:0	“ And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . For the wine would burst the wineskins , and the wine and the skins would both be lost . New wine calls for new wineskins . ”
41:2:023:0	One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields , his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat .
41:2:024:0	But the Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Look , why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath ? ”
41:2:025:0	Jesus said to them , “ Have n't you ever read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
41:2:026:0	He went into the house of God ( during the days when Abiathar was high priest ) and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat . He also gave some to his companions . ”
41:2:027:0	Then Jesus said to them , “ The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people , and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath .
41:2:028:0	So the Son of Man is Lord , even over the Sabbath ! ”
