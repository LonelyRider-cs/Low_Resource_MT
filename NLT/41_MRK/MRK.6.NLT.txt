41:6:001:1	Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
41:6:001:0	Jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to Nazareth , his hometown .
41:6:002:0	The next Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue , and many who heard him were amazed . They asked , “ Where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles ? ”
41:6:003:0	Then they scoffed , “ He 's just a carpenter , the son of Mary and the brother of James , Joseph , Judas , and Simon . And his sisters live right here among us. ” They were deeply offended and refused to believe in him .
41:6:004:0	Then Jesus told them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family . ”
41:6:005:0	And because of their unbelief , he could n't do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them .
41:6:002:1	Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples
41:6:006:0	And he was amazed at their unbelief.Then Jesus went from village to village , teaching the people .
41:6:007:0	And he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two , giving them authority to cast out evil spirits .
41:6:008:0	He told them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick — no food , no traveler 's bag , no money .
41:6:009:0	He allowed them to wear sandals but not to take a change of clothes .
41:6:010:0	“ Wherever you go , ” he said , “ stay in the same house until you leave town .
41:6:011:0	But if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you , shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate . ”
41:6:012:0	So the disciples went out , telling everyone they met to repent of their sins and turn to God .
41:6:003:1	The Death of John the Baptist
41:6:013:0	And they cast out many demons and healed many sick people , anointing them with olive oil .
41:6:014:0	Herod Antipas , the king , soon heard about Jesus , because everyone was talking about him . Some were saying , “ This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead . That is why he can do such miracles . ”
41:6:015:0	Others said , “ He 's the prophet Elijah. ” Still others said , “ He 's a prophet like the other great prophets of the past . ”
41:6:016:0	When Herod heard about Jesus , he said , “ John , the man I beheaded , has come back from the dead . ”
41:6:017:0	For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest and imprison John as a favor to Herodias . She had been his brother Philip 's wife , but Herod had married her .
41:6:018:0	John had been telling Herod , “ It is against God 's law for you to marry your brother 's wife . ”
41:6:019:0	So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him . But without Herod 's approval she was powerless ,
41:6:020:0	for Herod respected John ; and knowing that he was a good and holy man , he protected him . Herod was greatly disturbed whenever he talked with John , but even so , he liked to listen to him .
41:6:021:0	Herodias 's chance finally came on Herod 's birthday . He gave a party for his high government officials , army officers , and the leading citizens of Galilee .
41:6:022:0	Then his daughter , also named Herodias , came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased Herod and his guests . “ Ask me for anything you like , ” the king said to the girl , “ and I will give it to you . ”
41:6:023:0	He even vowed , “ I will give you whatever you ask , up to half my kingdom ! ”
41:6:024:0	She went out and asked her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” Her mother told her , “ Ask for the head of John the Baptist ! ”
41:6:025:0	So the girl hurried back to the king and told him , “ I want the head of John the Baptist , right now , on a tray ! ”
41:6:026:0	Then the king deeply regretted what he had said ; but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests , he could n't refuse her .
41:6:027:0	So he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off John 's head and bring it to him . The soldier beheaded John in the prison ,
41:6:028:0	brought his head on a tray , and gave it to the girl , who took it to her mother .
41:6:004:1	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand
41:6:029:0	When John 's disciples heard what had happened , they came to get his body and buried it in a tomb .
41:6:030:0	The apostles returned to Jesus from their ministry tour and told him all they had done and taught .
41:6:031:0	Then Jesus said , “ Let 's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile. ” He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and his apostles did n't even have time to eat .
41:6:032:0	So they left by boat for a quiet place , where they could be alone .
41:6:033:0	But many people recognized them and saw them leaving , and people from many towns ran ahead along the shore and got there ahead of them .
41:6:034:0	Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat , and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began teaching them many things .
41:6:035:0	Late in the afternoon his disciples came to him and said , “ This is a remote place , and it 's already getting late .
41:6:036:0	Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat . ”
41:6:037:0	But Jesus said , “ You feed them. ” “ With what ? ” they asked . “ We 'd have to work for months to earn enough money to buy food for all these people ! ”
41:6:038:0	“ How much bread do you have ? ” he asked . “ Go and find out. ” They came back and reported , “ We have five loaves of bread and two fish . ”
41:6:039:0	Then Jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass .
41:6:040:0	So they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred .
41:6:041:0	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish , looked up toward heaven , and blessed them . Then , breaking the loaves into pieces , he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people . He also divided the fish for everyone to share .
41:6:042:0	They all ate as much as they wanted ,
41:6:043:0	and afterward , the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish .
41:6:005:1	Jesus Walks on Water
41:6:044:0	A total of 5,000 men and their families were fed .
41:6:045:0	Immediately after this , Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to Bethsaida , while he sent the people home .
41:6:046:0	After telling everyone good-bye , he went up into the hills by himself to pray .
41:6:047:0	Late that night , the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake , and Jesus was alone on land .
41:6:048:0	He saw that they were in serious trouble , rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves . About three o'clock in the morning Jesus came toward them , walking on the water . He intended to go past them ,
41:6:049:0	but when they saw him walking on the water , they cried out in terror , thinking he was a ghost .
41:6:050:0	They were all terrified when they saw him.But Jesus spoke to them at once . “ Do n't be afraid , ” he said . “ Take courage ! I am here ! ”
41:6:051:0	Then he climbed into the boat , and the wind stopped . They were totally amazed ,
41:6:052:0	for they still did n't understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves . Their hearts were too hard to take it in .
41:6:053:0	After they had crossed the lake , they landed at Gennesaret . They brought the boat to shore
41:6:054:0	and climbed out . The people recognized Jesus at once ,
41:6:055:0	and they ran throughout the whole area , carrying sick people on mats to wherever they heard he was .
41:6:056:0	Wherever he went — in villages , cities , or the countryside — they brought the sick out to the marketplaces . They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe , and all who touched him were healed .
