45:13:001:1	Respect for Authority
45:13:001:0	Everyone must submit to governing authorities . For all authority comes from God , and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God .
45:13:002:0	So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted , and they will be punished .
45:13:003:0	For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right , but in those who are doing wrong . Would you like to live without fear of the authorities ? Do what is right , and they will honor you .
45:13:004:0	The authorities are God 's servants , sent for your good . But if you are doing wrong , of course you should be afraid , for they have the power to punish you . They are God 's servants , sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong .
45:13:005:0	So you must submit to them , not only to avoid punishment , but also to keep a clear conscience .
45:13:006:0	Pay your taxes , too , for these same reasons . For government workers need to be paid . They are serving God in what they do .
45:13:002:1	Love Fulfills God 's Requirements
45:13:007:0	Give to everyone what you owe them : Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them , and give respect and honor to those who are in authority .
45:13:008:0	Owe nothing to anyone—except for your obligation to love one another . If you love your neighbor , you will fulfill the requirements of God 's law .
45:13:009:0	For the commandments say , “ You must not commit adultery . You must not murder . You must not steal . You must not covet. ” These—and other such commandments—are summed up in this one commandment : “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
45:13:010:0	Love does no wrong to others , so love fulfills the requirements of God 's law .
45:13:011:0	This is all the more urgent , for you know how late it is ; time is running out . Wake up , for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
45:13:012:0	The night is almost gone ; the day of salvation will soon be here . So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes , and put on the shining armor of right living .
45:13:013:0	Because we belong to the day , we must live decent lives for all to see . Do n't participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness , or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living , or in quarreling and jealousy .
45:13:014:0	Instead , clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ . And do n't let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires .
