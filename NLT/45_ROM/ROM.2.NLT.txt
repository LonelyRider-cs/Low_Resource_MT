45:2:001:1	God 's Judgment of Sin
45:2:001:0	You may think you can condemn such people , but you are just as bad , and you have no excuse ! When you say they are wicked and should be punished , you are condemning yourself , for you who judge others do these very same things .
45:2:002:0	And we know that God , in his justice , will punish anyone who does such things .
45:2:003:0	Since you judge others for doing these things , why do you think you can avoid God 's judgment when you do the same things ?
45:2:004:0	Do n't you see how wonderfully kind , tolerant , and patient God is with you ? Does this mean nothing to you ? Ca n't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin ?
45:2:005:0	But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin , you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself . For a day of anger is coming , when God 's righteous judgment will be revealed .
45:2:006:0	He will judge everyone according to what they have done .
45:2:007:0	He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good , seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers .
45:2:008:0	But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves , who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness .
45:2:009:0	There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil — for the Jew first and also for the Gentile .
45:2:010:0	But there will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who do good — for the Jew first and also for the Gentile .
45:2:011:0	For God does not show favoritism .
45:2:012:0	When the Gentiles sin , they will be destroyed , even though they never had God 's written law . And the Jews , who do have God 's law , will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it .
45:2:013:0	For merely listening to the law does n't make us right with God . It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight .
45:2:014:0	Even Gentiles , who do not have God 's written law , show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it , even without having heard it .
45:2:015:0	They demonstrate that God 's law is written in their hearts , for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right .
45:2:002:1	The Jews and the Law
45:2:016:0	And this is the message I proclaim — that the day is coming when God , through Christ Jesus , will judge everyone 's secret life .
45:2:017:0	You who call yourselves Jews are relying on God 's law , and you boast about your special relationship with him .
45:2:018:0	You know what he wants ; you know what is right because you have been taught his law .
45:2:019:0	You are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness .
45:2:020:0	You think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God . For you are certain that God 's law gives you complete knowledge and truth .
45:2:021:0	Well then , if you teach others , why do n't you teach yourself ? You tell others not to steal , but do you steal ?
45:2:022:0	You say it is wrong to commit adultery , but do you commit adultery ? You condemn idolatry , but do you use items stolen from pagan temples ?
45:2:023:0	You are so proud of knowing the law , but you dishonor God by breaking it .
45:2:024:0	No wonder the Scriptures say , “ The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you . ”
45:2:025:0	The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God 's law . But if you do n't obey God 's law , you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile .
45:2:026:0	And if the Gentiles obey God 's law , wo n't God declare them to be his own people ?
45:2:027:0	In fact , uncircumcised Gentiles who keep God 's law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God 's law but do n't obey it .
45:2:028:0	For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision .
45:2:029:0	No , a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God . And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law ; rather , it is a change of heart produced by the Spirit . And a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God , not from people .
