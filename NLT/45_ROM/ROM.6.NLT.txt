45:6:001:1	Sin 's Power Is Broken
45:6:001:0	Well then , should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace ?
45:6:002:0	Of course not ! Since we have died to sin , how can we continue to live in it ?
45:6:003:0	Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism , we joined him in his death ?
45:6:004:0	For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism . And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father , now we also may live new lives .
45:6:005:0	Since we have been united with him in his death , we will also be raised to life as he was .
45:6:006:0	We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives . We are no longer slaves to sin .
45:6:007:0	For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin .
45:6:008:0	And since we died with Christ , we know we will also live with him .
45:6:009:0	We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead , and he will never die again . Death no longer has any power over him .
45:6:010:0	When he died , he died once to break the power of sin . But now that he lives , he lives for the glory of God .
45:6:011:0	So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus .
45:6:012:0	Do not let sin control the way you live ; do not give in to sinful desires .
45:6:013:0	Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin . Instead , give yourselves completely to God , for you were dead , but now you have new life . So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God .
45:6:014:0	Sin is no longer your master , for you no longer live under the requirements of the law . Instead , you live under the freedom of God 's grace .
45:6:015:0	Well then , since God 's grace has set us free from the law , does that mean we can go on sinning ? Of course not !
45:6:016:0	Do n't you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey ? You can be a slave to sin , which leads to death , or you can choose to obey God , which leads to righteous living .
45:6:017:0	Thank God ! Once you were slaves of sin , but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you .
45:6:018:0	Now you are free from your slavery to sin , and you have become slaves to righteous living .
45:6:019:0	Because of the weakness of your human nature , I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this . Previously , you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness , which led ever deeper into sin . Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy .
45:6:020:0	When you were slaves to sin , you were free from the obligation to do right .
45:6:021:0	And what was the result ? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do , things that end in eternal doom .
45:6:022:0	But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God . Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life .
45:6:023:0	For the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord .
