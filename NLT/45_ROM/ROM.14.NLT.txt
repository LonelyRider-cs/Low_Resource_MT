45:14:001:1	The Danger of Criticism
45:14:001:0	Accept other believers who are weak in faith , and do n't argue with them about what they think is right or wrong .
45:14:002:0	For instance , one person believes it 's all right to eat anything . But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables .
45:14:003:0	Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who do n't . And those who do n't eat certain foods must not condemn those who do , for God has accepted them .
45:14:004:0	Who are you to condemn someone else 's servants ? Their own master will judge whether they stand or fall . And with the Lord 's help , they will stand and receive his approval .
45:14:005:0	In the same way , some think one day is more holy than another day , while others think every day is alike . You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable .
45:14:006:0	Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him . Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord , since they give thanks to God before eating . And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God .
45:14:007:0	For we do n't live for ourselves or die for ourselves .
45:14:008:0	If we live , it 's to honor the Lord . And if we die , it 's to honor the Lord . So whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
45:14:009:0	Christ died and rose again for this very purpose — to be Lord both of the living and of the dead .
45:14:010:0	So why do you condemn another believer ? Why do you look down on another believer ? Remember , we will all stand before the judgment seat of God .
45:14:011:0	For the Scriptures say , “ ‘ As surely as I live , ' says the Lord , ‘ every knee will bend to me , and every tongue will declare allegiance to God . ' ”
45:14:012:0	Yes , each of us will give a personal account to God .
45:14:013:0	So let 's stop condemning each other . Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall .
45:14:014:0	I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food , in and of itself , is wrong to eat . But if someone believes it is wrong , then for that person it is wrong .
45:14:015:0	And if another believer is distressed by what you eat , you are not acting in love if you eat it . Do n't let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died .
45:14:016:0	Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good .
45:14:017:0	For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink , but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45:14:018:0	If you serve Christ with this attitude , you will please God , and others will approve of you , too .
45:14:019:0	So then , let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up .
45:14:020:0	Do n't tear apart the work of God over what you eat . Remember , all foods are acceptable , but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble .
45:14:021:0	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble .
45:14:022:0	You may believe there 's nothing wrong with what you are doing , but keep it between yourself and God . Blessed are those who do n't feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right .
45:14:023:0	But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something , you are sinning if you go ahead and do it . For you are not following your convictions . If you do anything you believe is not right , you are sinning .
