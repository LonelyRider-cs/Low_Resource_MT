45:10:001:0	Dear brothers and sisters , the longing of my heart and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved .
45:10:002:0	I know what enthusiasm they have for God , but it is misdirected zeal .
45:10:003:0	For they do n't understand God 's way of making people right with himself . Refusing to accept God 's way , they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law .
45:10:001:1	Salvation Is for Everyone
45:10:004:0	For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given . As a result , all who believe in him are made right with God .
45:10:005:0	For Moses writes that the law 's way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands .
45:10:006:0	But faith 's way of getting right with God says , “ Do n't say in your heart , ‘ Who will go up to heaven ? ' ( to bring Christ down to earth ) .
45:10:007:0	And do n't say , ‘ Who will go down to the place of the dead ? ' ( to bring Christ back to life again ) . ”
45:10:008:0	In fact , it says , “ The message is very close at hand ; it is on your lips and in your heart. ” And that message is the very message about faith that we preach :
45:10:009:0	If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45:10:010:0	For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God , and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved .
45:10:011:0	As the Scriptures tell us , “ Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced . ”
45:10:012:0	Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect . They have the same Lord , who gives generously to all who call on him .
45:10:013:0	For “ Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . ”
45:10:014:0	But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him ? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him ? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them ?
45:10:015:0	And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent ? That is why the Scriptures say , “ How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news ! ”
45:10:016:0	But not everyone welcomes the Good News , for Isaiah the prophet said , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? ”
45:10:017:0	So faith comes from hearing , that is , hearing the Good News about Christ .
45:10:018:0	But I ask , have the people of Israel actually heard the message ? Yes , they have : “ The message has gone throughout the earth , and the words to all the world . ”
45:10:019:0	But I ask , did the people of Israel really understand ? Yes , they did , for even in the time of Moses , God said , “ I will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation.I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles . ”
45:10:020:0	And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God , saying , “ I was found by people who were not looking for me.I showed myself to those who were not asking for me . ”
45:10:021:0	But regarding Israel , God said , “ All day long I opened my arms to them , but they were disobedient and rebellious . ”
