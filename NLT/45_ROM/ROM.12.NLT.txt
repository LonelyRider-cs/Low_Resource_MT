45:12:001:1	A Living Sacrifice to God
45:12:001:0	And so , dear brothers and sisters , I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you . Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable . This is truly the way to worship him .
45:12:002:0	Do n't copy the behavior and customs of this world , but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think . Then you will learn to know God 's will for you , which is good and pleasing and perfect .
45:12:003:0	Because of the privilege and authority God has given me , I give each of you this warning : Do n't think you are better than you really are . Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves , measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us .
45:12:004:0	Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function ,
45:12:005:0	so it is with Christ 's body . We are many parts of one body , and we all belong to each other .
45:12:006:0	In his grace , God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well . So if God has given you the ability to prophesy , speak out with as much faith as God has given you .
45:12:007:0	If your gift is serving others , serve them well . If you are a teacher , teach well .
45:12:008:0	If your gift is to encourage others , be encouraging . If it is giving , give generously . If God has given you leadership ability , take the responsibility seriously . And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others , do it gladly .
45:12:009:0	Do n't just pretend to love others . Really love them . Hate what is wrong . Hold tightly to what is good .
45:12:010:0	Love each other with genuine affection , and take delight in honoring each other .
45:12:011:0	Never be lazy , but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically .
45:12:012:0	Rejoice in our confident hope . Be patient in trouble , and keep on praying .
45:12:013:0	When God 's people are in need , be ready to help them . Always be eager to practice hospitality .
45:12:014:0	Bless those who persecute you . Do n't curse them ; pray that God will bless them .
45:12:015:0	Be happy with those who are happy , and weep with those who weep .
45:12:016:0	Live in harmony with each other . Do n't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people . And do n't think you know it all !
45:12:017:0	Never pay back evil with more evil . Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable .
45:12:018:0	Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone .
45:12:019:0	Dear friends , never take revenge . Leave that to the righteous anger of God . For the Scriptures say , “ I will take revenge ; I will pay them back , ” says the Lord .
45:12:020:0	Instead , “ If your enemies are hungry , feed them.If they are thirsty , give them something to drink.In doing this , you will heapburning coals of shame on their heads . ”
45:12:021:0	Do n't let evil conquer you , but conquer evil by doing good .
