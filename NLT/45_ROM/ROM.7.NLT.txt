45:7:001:1	No Longer Bound to the Law
45:7:001:0	Now , dear brothers and sisters—you who are familiar with the law—do n't you know that the law applies only while a person is living ?
45:7:002:0	For example , when a woman marries , the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive . But if he dies , the laws of marriage no longer apply to her .
45:7:003:0	So while her husband is alive , she would be committing adultery if she married another man . But if her husband dies , she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries .
45:7:004:0	So , my dear brothers and sisters , this is the point : You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ . And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead . As a result , we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God .
45:7:005:0	When we were controlled by our old nature , sinful desires were at work within us , and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds , resulting in death .
45:7:002:1	God 's Law Reveals Our Sin
45:7:006:0	But now we have been released from the law , for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power . Now we can serve God , not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law , but in the new way of living in the Spirit .
45:7:007:0	Well then , am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful ? Of course not ! In fact , it was the law that showed me my sin . I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said , “ You must not covet . ”
45:7:008:0	But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me ! If there were no law , sin would not have that power .
45:7:009:0	At one time I lived without understanding the law . But when I learned the command not to covet , for instance , the power of sin came to life ,
45:7:010:0	and I died . So I discovered that the law 's commands , which were supposed to bring life , brought spiritual death instead .
45:7:011:0	Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me ; it used the commands to kill me .
45:7:012:0	But still , the law itself is holy , and its commands are holy and right and good .
45:7:003:1	Struggling with Sin
45:7:013:0	But how can that be ? Did the law , which is good , cause my death ? Of course not ! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death . So we can see how terrible sin really is . It uses God 's good commands for its own evil purposes .
45:7:014:0	So the trouble is not with the law , for it is spiritual and good . The trouble is with me , for I am all too human , a slave to sin .
45:7:015:0	I do n't really understand myself , for I want to do what is right , but I do n't do it . Instead , I do what I hate .
45:7:016:0	But if I know that what I am doing is wrong , this shows that I agree that the law is good .
45:7:017:0	So I am not the one doing wrong ; it is sin living in me that does it .
45:7:018:0	And I know that nothing good lives in me , that is , in my sinful nature . I want to do what is right , but I ca n't .
45:7:019:0	I want to do what is good , but I do n't . I do n't want to do what is wrong , but I do it anyway .
45:7:020:0	But if I do what I do n't want to do , I am not really the one doing wrong ; it is sin living in me that does it .
45:7:021:0	I have discovered this principle of life—that when I want to do what is right , I inevitably do what is wrong .
45:7:022:0	I love God 's law with all my heart .
45:7:023:0	But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind . This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me .
45:7:024:0	Oh , what a miserable person I am ! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death ?
45:7:025:0	Thank God ! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord . So you see how it is : In my mind I really want to obey God 's law , but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin .
