45:11:001:1	God 's Mercy on Israel
45:11:001:0	I ask , then , has God rejected his own people , the nation of Israel ? Of course not ! I myself am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham and a member of the tribe of Benjamin .
45:11:002:0	No , God has not rejected his own people , whom he chose from the very beginning . Do you realize what the Scriptures say about this ? Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said ,
45:11:003:0	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars . I am the only one left , and now they are trying to kill me , too . ”
45:11:004:0	And do you remember God 's reply ? He said , “ No , I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal ! ”
45:11:005:0	It is the same today , for a few of the people of Israel have remained faithful because of God 's grace — his undeserved kindness in choosing them .
45:11:006:0	And since it is through God 's kindness , then it is not by their good works . For in that case , God 's grace would not be what it really is — free and undeserved .
45:11:007:0	So this is the situation : Most of the people of Israel have not found the favor of God they are looking for so earnestly . A few have — the ones God has chosen — but the hearts of the rest were hardened .
45:11:008:0	As the Scriptures say , “ God has put them into a deep sleep.To this day he has shut their eyes so they do not see , and closed their ears so they do not hear . ”
45:11:009:0	Likewise , David said , “ Let their bountiful table become a snare , a trap that makes them think all is well.Let their blessings cause them to stumble , and let them get what they deserve .
45:11:010:0	Let their eyes go blind so they can not see , and let their backs be bent forever . ”
45:11:011:0	Did God 's people stumble and fall beyond recovery ? Of course not ! They were disobedient , so God made salvation available to the Gentiles . But he wanted his own people to become jealous and claim it for themselves .
45:11:012:0	Now if the Gentiles were enriched because the people of Israel turned down God 's offer of salvation , think how much greater a blessing the world will share when they finally accept it .
45:11:013:0	I am saying all this especially for you Gentiles . God has appointed me as the apostle to the Gentiles . I stress this ,
45:11:014:0	for I want somehow to make the people of Israel jealous of what you Gentiles have , so I might save some of them .
45:11:015:0	For since their rejection meant that God offered salvation to the rest of the world , their acceptance will be even more wonderful . It will be life for those who were dead !
45:11:016:0	And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy , their descendants will also be holy — just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy . For if the roots of the tree are holy , the branches will be , too .
45:11:017:0	But some of these branches from Abraham 's tree — some of the people of Israel — have been broken off . And you Gentiles , who were branches from a wild olive tree , have been grafted in . So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children , sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God 's special olive tree .
45:11:018:0	But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off . You are just a branch , not the root .
45:11:019:0	“ Well , ” you may say , “ those branches were broken off to make room for me . ”
45:11:020:0	Yes , but remember — those branches were broken off because they did n't believe in Christ , and you are there because you do believe . So do n't think highly of yourself , but fear what could happen .
45:11:021:0	For if God did not spare the original branches , he wo n't spare you either .
45:11:022:0	Notice how God is both kind and severe . He is severe toward those who disobeyed , but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness . But if you stop trusting , you also will be cut off .
45:11:023:0	And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief , they will be grafted in again , for God has the power to graft them back into the tree .
45:11:002:1	God 's Mercy Is for Everyone
45:11:024:0	You , by nature , were a branch cut from a wild olive tree . So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree , he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong .
45:11:025:0	I want you to understand this mystery , dear brothers and sisters , so that you will not feel proud about yourselves . Some of the people of Israel have hard hearts , but this will last only until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ .
45:11:026:0	And so all Israel will be saved . As the Scriptures say , “ The one who rescues will come from Jerusalem , and he will turn Israel away from ungodliness .
45:11:027:0	And this is my covenant with them , that I will take away their sins . ”
45:11:028:0	Many of the people of Israel are now enemies of the Good News , and this benefits you Gentiles . Yet they are still the people he loves because he chose their ancestors Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
45:11:029:0	For God 's gifts and his call can never be withdrawn .
45:11:030:0	Once , you Gentiles were rebels against God , but when the people of Israel rebelled against him , God was merciful to you instead .
45:11:031:0	Now they are the rebels , and God 's mercy has come to you so that they , too , will share in God 's mercy .
45:11:032:0	For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone .
45:11:033:0	Oh , how great are God 's riches and wisdom and knowledge ! How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways !
45:11:034:0	For who can know the Lord 's thoughts ? Who knows enough to give him advice ?
45:11:035:0	And who has given him so muchthat he needs to pay it back ?
45:11:036:0	For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory . All glory to him forever ! Amen .
