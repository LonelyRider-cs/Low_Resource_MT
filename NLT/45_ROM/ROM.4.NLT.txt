45:4:001:1	The Faith of Abraham
45:4:001:0	Abraham was , humanly speaking , the founder of our Jewish nation . What did he discover about being made right with God ?
45:4:002:0	If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God , he would have had something to boast about . But that was not God 's way .
45:4:003:0	For the Scriptures tell us , “ Abraham believed God , and God counted him as righteous because of his faith . ”
45:4:004:0	When people work , their wages are not a gift , but something they have earned .
45:4:005:0	But people are counted as righteous , not because of their work , but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners .
45:4:006:0	David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it :
45:4:007:0	“ Oh , what joy for thosewhose disobedience is forgiven , whose sins are put out of sight .
45:4:008:0	Yes , what joy for thosewhose record the Lord has cleared of sin . ”
45:4:009:0	Now , is this blessing only for the Jews , or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles ? Well , we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith .
45:4:010:0	But how did this happen ? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised , or was it before he was circumcised ? Clearly , God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised !
45:4:011:0	Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous—even before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised . They are counted as righteous because of their faith .
45:4:012:0	And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised , but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised .
45:4:013:0	Clearly , God 's promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God 's law , but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith .
45:4:014:0	If God 's promise is only for those who obey the law , then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless .
45:4:015:0	For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it . ( The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break ! )
45:4:016:0	So the promise is received by faith . It is given as a free gift . And we are all certain to receive it , whether or not we live according to the law of Moses , if we have faith like Abraham 's . For Abraham is the father of all who believe .
45:4:017:0	That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him , “ I have made you the father of many nations. ” This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing .
45:4:018:0	Even when there was no reason for hope , Abraham kept hoping—believing that he would become the father of many nations . For God had said to him , “ That 's how many descendants you will have ! ”
45:4:019:0	And Abraham 's faith did not weaken , even though , at about 100 years of age , he figured his body was as good as dead—and so was Sarah 's womb .
45:4:020:0	Abraham never wavered in believing God 's promise . In fact , his faith grew stronger , and in this he brought glory to God .
45:4:021:0	He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises .
45:4:022:0	And because of Abraham 's faith , God counted him as righteous .
45:4:023:0	And when God counted him as righteous , it was n't just for Abraham 's benefit . It was recorded
45:4:024:0	for our benefit , too , assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him , the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
45:4:025:0	He was handed over to die because of our sins , and he was raised to life to make us right with God .
