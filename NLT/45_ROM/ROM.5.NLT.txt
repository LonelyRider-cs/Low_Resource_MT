45:5:001:1	Faith Brings Joy
45:5:001:0	Therefore , since we have been made right in God 's sight by faith , we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us .
45:5:002:0	Because of our faith , Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand , and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God 's glory .
45:5:003:0	We can rejoice , too , when we run into problems and trials , for we know that they help us develop endurance .
45:5:004:0	And endurance develops strength of character , and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation .
45:5:005:0	And this hope will not lead to disappointment . For we know how dearly God loves us , because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love .
45:5:006:0	When we were utterly helpless , Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners .
45:5:007:0	Now , most people would not be willing to die for an upright person , though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good .
45:5:008:0	But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners .
45:5:009:0	And since we have been made right in God 's sight by the blood of Christ , he will certainly save us from God 's condemnation .
45:5:010:0	For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies , we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son .
45:5:002:1	Adam and Christ Contrasted
45:5:011:0	So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God .
45:5:012:0	When Adam sinned , sin entered the world . Adam 's sin brought death , so death spread to everyone , for everyone sinned .
45:5:013:0	Yes , people sinned even before the law was given . But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break .
45:5:014:0	Still , everyone died — from the time of Adam to the time of Moses — even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God , as Adam did . Now Adam is a symbol , a representation of Christ , who was yet to come .
45:5:015:0	But there is a great difference between Adam 's sin and God 's gracious gift . For the sin of this one man , Adam , brought death to many . But even greater is God 's wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man , Jesus Christ .
45:5:016:0	And the result of God 's gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man 's sin . For Adam 's sin led to condemnation , but God 's free gift leads to our being made right with God , even though we are guilty of many sins .
45:5:017:0	For the sin of this one man , Adam , caused death to rule over many . But even greater is God 's wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness , for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man , Jesus Christ .
45:5:018:0	Yes , Adam 's one sin brings condemnation for everyone , but Christ 's one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone .
45:5:019:0	Because one person disobeyed God , many became sinners . But because one other person obeyed God , many will be made righteous .
45:5:020:0	God 's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were . But as people sinned more and more , God 's wonderful grace became more abundant .
45:5:021:0	So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death , now God 's wonderful grace rules instead , giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
