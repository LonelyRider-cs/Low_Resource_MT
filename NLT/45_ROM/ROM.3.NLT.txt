45:3:001:1	God Remains Faithful
45:3:001:0	Then what 's the advantage of being a Jew ? Is there any value in the ceremony of circumcision ?
45:3:002:0	Yes , there are great benefits ! First of all , the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God .
45:3:003:0	True , some of them were unfaithful ; but just because they were unfaithful , does that mean God will be unfaithful ?
45:3:004:0	Of course not ! Even if everyone else is a liar , God is true . As the Scriptures say about him , “ You will be proved right in what you say , and you will win your case in court . ”
45:3:005:0	“ But , ” some might say , “ our sinfulness serves a good purpose , for it helps people see how righteous God is . Is n't it unfair , then , for him to punish us ? ” ( This is merely a human point of view . )
45:3:006:0	Of course not ! If God were not entirely fair , how would he be qualified to judge the world ?
45:3:007:0	“ But , ” someone might still argue , “ how can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory ? ”
45:3:002:1	All People Are Sinners
45:3:008:0	And some people even slander us by claiming that we say , “ The more we sin , the better it is ! ” Those who say such things deserve to be condemned .
45:3:009:0	Well then , should we conclude that we Jews are better than others ? No , not at all , for we have already shown that all people , whether Jews or Gentiles , are under the power of sin .
45:3:010:0	As the Scriptures say , “ No one is righteous — not even one .
45:3:011:0	No one is truly wise ; no one is seeking God .
45:3:012:0	All have turned away ; all have become useless.No one does good , not a single one . ”
45:3:013:0	“ Their talk is foul , like the stench from an open grave.Their tongues are filled with lies. ” “ Snake venom drips from their lips . ”
45:3:014:0	“ Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness . ”
45:3:015:0	“ They rush to commit murder .
45:3:016:0	Destruction and misery always follow them .
45:3:017:0	They do n't know where to find peace . ”
45:3:018:0	“ They have no fear of God at all . ”
45:3:019:0	Obviously , the law applies to those to whom it was given , for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses , and to show that the entire world is guilty before God .
45:3:003:1	Christ Took Our Punishment
45:3:020:0	For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands . The law simply shows us how sinful we are .
45:3:021:0	But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law , as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago .
45:3:022:0	We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ . And this is true for everyone who believes , no matter who we are .
45:3:023:0	For everyone has sinned ; we all fall short of God 's glorious standard .
45:3:024:0	Yet God , in his grace , freely makes us right in his sight . He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins .
45:3:025:0	For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin . People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life , shedding his blood . This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past ,
45:3:026:0	for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time . God did this to demonstrate his righteousness , for he himself is fair and just , and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus .
45:3:027:0	Can we boast , then , that we have done anything to be accepted by God ? No , because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law . It is based on faith .
45:3:028:0	So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law .
45:3:029:0	After all , is God the God of the Jews only ? Is n't he also the God of the Gentiles ? Of course he is .
45:3:030:0	There is only one God , and he makes people right with himself only by faith , whether they are Jews or Gentiles .
45:3:031:0	Well then , if we emphasize faith , does this mean that we can forget about the law ? Of course not ! In fact , only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law .
