45:9:001:1	God 's Selection of Israel
45:9:001:0	With Christ as my witness , I speak with utter truthfulness . My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it .
45:9:002:0	My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief
45:9:003:0	for my people , my Jewish brothers and sisters . I would be willing to be forever cursed — cut off from Christ ! — if that would save them .
45:9:004:0	They are the people of Israel , chosen to be God 's adopted children . God revealed his glory to them . He made covenants with them and gave them his law . He gave them the privilege of worshiping him and receiving his wonderful promises .
45:9:005:0	Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob are their ancestors , and Christ himself was an Israelite as far as his human nature is concerned . And he is God , the one who rules over everything and is worthy of eternal praise ! Amen .
45:9:006:0	Well then , has God failed to fulfill his promise to Israel ? No , for not all who are born into the nation of Israel are truly members of God 's people !
45:9:007:0	Being descendants of Abraham does n't make them truly Abraham 's children . For the Scriptures say , “ Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted , ” though Abraham had other children , too .
45:9:008:0	This means that Abraham 's physical descendants are not necessarily children of God . Only the children of the promise are considered to be Abraham 's children .
45:9:009:0	For God had promised , “ I will return about this time next year , and Sarah will have a son . ”
45:9:010:0	This son was our ancestor Isaac . When he married Rebekah , she gave birth to twins .
45:9:011:0	But before they were born , before they had done anything good or bad , she received a message from God . ( This message shows that God chooses people according to his own purposes ;
45:9:012:0	he calls people , but not according to their good or bad works . ) She was told , “ Your older son will serve your younger son . ”
45:9:013:0	In the words of the Scriptures , “ I loved Jacob , but I rejected Esau . ”
45:9:014:0	Are we saying , then , that God was unfair ? Of course not !
45:9:015:0	For God said to Moses , “ I will show mercy to anyone I choose , and I will show compassion to anyone I choose . ”
45:9:016:0	So it is God who decides to show mercy . We can neither choose it nor work for it .
45:9:017:0	For the Scriptures say that God told Pharaoh , “ I have appointed you for the very purpose of displaying my power in you and to spread my fame throughout the earth . ”
45:9:018:0	So you see , God chooses to show mercy to some , and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen .
45:9:019:0	Well then , you might say , “ Why does God blame people for not responding ? Have n't they simply done what he makes them do ? ”
45:9:020:0	No , do n't say that . Who are you , a mere human being , to argue with God ? Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it , “ Why have you made me like this ? ”
45:9:021:0	When a potter makes jars out of clay , does n't he have a right to use the same lump of clay to make one jar for decoration and another to throw garbage into ?
45:9:022:0	In the same way , even though God has the right to show his anger and his power , he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls , who are destined for destruction .
45:9:023:0	He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy , who were prepared in advance for glory .
45:9:024:0	And we are among those whom he selected , both from the Jews and from the Gentiles .
45:9:025:0	Concerning the Gentiles , God says in the prophecy of Hosea , “ Those who were not my people , I will now call my people.And I will love thosewhom I did not love before . ”
45:9:026:0	And , “ Then , at the place where they were told , ‘ You are not my people , 'there they will be called ‘ children of the living God . ' ”
45:9:027:0	And concerning Israel , Isaiah the prophet cried out , “ Though the people of Israel are as numerous as the sand of the seashore , only a remnant will be saved .
45:9:028:0	For the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earthquickly and with finality . ”
45:9:002:1	Israel 's Unbelief
45:9:029:0	And Isaiah said the same thing in another place : “ If the Lord of Heaven 's Armieshad not spared a few of our children , we would have been wiped out like Sodom , destroyed like Gomorrah . ”
45:9:030:0	What does all this mean ? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God 's standards , they were made right with God . And it was by faith that this took place .
45:9:031:0	But the people of Israel , who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law , never succeeded .
45:9:032:0	Why not ? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him . They stumbled over the great rock in their path .
45:9:033:0	God warned them of this in the Scriptures when he said , “ I am placing a stone in Jerusalem that makes people stumble , a rock that makes them fall.But anyone who trusts in himwill never be disgraced . ”
