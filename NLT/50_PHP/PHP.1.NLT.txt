50:1:001:1	Greetings from Paul
50:1:001:0	This letter is from Paul and Timothy , slaves of Christ Jesus.I am writing to all of God 's holy people in Philippi who belong to Christ Jesus , including the church leaders and deacons .
50:1:002:1	Paul 's Thanksgiving and Prayer
50:1:002:0	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
50:1:003:0	Every time I think of you , I give thanks to my God .
50:1:004:0	Whenever I pray , I make my requests for all of you with joy ,
50:1:005:0	for you have been my partners in spreading the Good News about Christ from the time you first heard it until now .
50:1:006:0	And I am certain that God , who began the good work within you , will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns .
50:1:007:0	So it is right that I should feel as I do about all of you , for you have a special place in my heart . You share with me the special favor of God , both in my imprisonment and in defending and confirming the truth of the Good News .
50:1:008:0	God knows how much I love you and long for you with the tender compassion of Christ Jesus .
50:1:009:0	I pray that your love will overflow more and more , and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding .
50:1:010:0	For I want you to understand what really matters , so that you may live pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ 's return .
50:1:003:1	Paul 's Joy That Christ Is Preached
50:1:011:0	May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ—for this will bring much glory and praise to God .
50:1:012:0	And I want you to know , my dear brothers and sisters , that everything that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News .
50:1:013:0	For everyone here , including the whole palace guard , knows that I am in chains because of Christ .
50:1:014:0	And because of my imprisonment , most of the believers here have gained confidence and boldly speak God 's message without fear .
50:1:015:0	It 's true that some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry . But others preach about Christ with pure motives .
50:1:016:0	They preach because they love me , for they know I have been appointed to defend the Good News .
50:1:017:0	Those others do not have pure motives as they preach about Christ . They preach with selfish ambition , not sincerely , intending to make my chains more painful to me .
50:1:018:0	But that does n't matter . Whether their motives are false or genuine , the message about Christ is being preached either way , so I rejoice . And I will continue to rejoice .
50:1:004:1	Paul 's Life for Christ
50:1:019:0	For I know that as you pray for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps me , this will lead to my deliverance .
50:1:020:0	For I fully expect and hope that I will never be ashamed , but that I will continue to be bold for Christ , as I have been in the past . And I trust that my life will bring honor to Christ , whether I live or die .
50:1:021:0	For to me , living means living for Christ , and dying is even better .
50:1:022:0	But if I live , I can do more fruitful work for Christ . So I really do n't know which is better .
50:1:023:0	I 'm torn between two desires : I long to go and be with Christ , which would be far better for me .
50:1:024:0	But for your sakes , it is better that I continue to live .
50:1:025:0	Knowing this , I am convinced that I will remain alive so I can continue to help all of you grow and experience the joy of your faith .
50:1:005:1	Live as Citizens of Heaven
50:1:026:0	And when I come to you again , you will have even more reason to take pride in Christ Jesus because of what he is doing through me .
50:1:027:0	Above all , you must live as citizens of heaven , conducting yourselves in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ . Then , whether I come and see you again or only hear about you , I will know that you are standing together with one spirit and one purpose , fighting together for the faith , which is the Good News .
50:1:028:0	Do n't be intimidated in any way by your enemies . This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed , but that you are going to be saved , even by God himself .
50:1:029:0	For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him .
50:1:030:0	We are in this struggle together . You have seen my struggle in the past , and you know that I am still in the midst of it .
