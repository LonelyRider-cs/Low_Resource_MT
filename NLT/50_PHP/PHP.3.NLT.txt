50:3:001:1	The Priceless Value of Knowing Christ
50:3:001:0	Whatever happens , my dear brothers and sisters , rejoice in the Lord . I never get tired of telling you these things , and I do it to safeguard your faith .
50:3:002:0	Watch out for those dogs , those people who do evil , those mutilators who say you must be circumcised to be saved .
50:3:003:0	For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised . We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us . We put no confidence in human effort ,
50:3:004:0	though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could . Indeed , if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts , I have even more !
50:3:005:0	I was circumcised when I was eight days old . I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjaminâ€”a real Hebrew if there ever was one ! I was a member of the Pharisees , who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law .
50:3:006:0	I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church . And as for righteousness , I obeyed the law without fault .
50:3:007:0	I once thought these things were valuable , but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done .
50:3:008:0	Yes , everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I have discarded everything else , counting it all as garbage , so that I could gain Christ
50:3:009:0	and become one with him . I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law ; rather , I become righteous through faith in Christ . For God 's way of making us right with himself depends on faith .
50:3:010:0	I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead . I want to suffer with him , sharing in his death ,
50:3:002:1	Pressing toward the Goal
50:3:011:0	so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead !
50:3:012:0	I do n't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection . But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me .
50:3:013:0	No , dear brothers and sisters , I have not achieved it , but I focus on this one thing : Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead ,
50:3:014:0	I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God , through Christ Jesus , is calling us .
50:3:015:0	Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things . If you disagree on some point , I believe God will make it plain to you .
50:3:016:0	But we must hold on to the progress we have already made .
50:3:017:0	Dear brothers and sisters , pattern your lives after mine , and learn from those who follow our example .
50:3:018:0	For I have told you often before , and I say it again with tears in my eyes , that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ .
50:3:019:0	They are headed for destruction . Their god is their appetite , they brag about shameful things , and they think only about this life here on earth .
50:3:020:0	But we are citizens of heaven , where the Lord Jesus Christ lives . And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior .
50:3:021:0	He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own , using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control .
