50:2:001:1	Have the Attitude of Christ
50:2:001:0	Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ ? Any comfort from his love ? Any fellowship together in the Spirit ? Are your hearts tender and compassionate ?
50:2:002:0	Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other , loving one another , and working together with one mind and purpose .
50:2:003:0	Do n't be selfish ; do n't try to impress others . Be humble , thinking of others as better than yourselves .
50:2:004:0	Do n't look out only for your own interests , but take an interest in others , too .
50:2:005:0	You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had .
50:2:006:0	Though he was God , he did not think of equality with Godas something to cling to .
50:2:007:0	Instead , he gave up his divine privileges ; he took the humble position of a slaveand was born as a human being.When he appeared in human form ,
50:2:008:0	he humbled himself in obedience to Godand died a criminal 's death on a cross .
50:2:009:0	Therefore , God elevated him to the place of highest honorand gave him the name above all other names ,
50:2:010:0	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
50:2:002:1	Shine Brightly for Christ
50:2:011:0	and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50:2:012:0	Dear friends , you always followed my instructions when I was with you . And now that I am away , it is even more important . Work hard to show the results of your salvation , obeying God with deep reverence and fear .
50:2:013:0	For God is working in you , giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him .
50:2:014:0	Do everything without complaining and arguing ,
50:2:015:0	so that no one can criticize you . Live clean , innocent lives as children of God , shining like bright lights in a world full of crooked and perverse people .
50:2:016:0	Hold firmly to the word of life ; then , on the day of Christ 's return , I will be proud that I did not run the race in vain and that my work was not useless .
50:2:017:0	But I will rejoice even if I lose my life , pouring it out like a liquid offering to God , just like your faithful service is an offering to God . And I want all of you to share that joy .
50:2:003:1	Paul Commends Timothy
50:2:018:0	Yes , you should rejoice , and I will share your joy .
50:2:019:0	If the Lord Jesus is willing , I hope to send Timothy to you soon for a visit . Then he can cheer me up by telling me how you are getting along .
50:2:020:0	I have no one else like Timothy , who genuinely cares about your welfare .
50:2:021:0	All the others care only for themselves and not for what matters to Jesus Christ .
50:2:022:0	But you know how Timothy has proved himself . Like a son with his father , he has served with me in preaching the Good News .
50:2:023:0	I hope to send him to you just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here .
50:2:004:1	Paul Commends Epaphroditus
50:2:024:0	And I have confidence from the Lord that I myself will come to see you soon .
50:2:025:0	Meanwhile , I thought I should send Epaphroditus back to you . He is a true brother , co-worker , and fellow soldier . And he was your messenger to help me in my need .
50:2:026:0	I am sending him because he has been longing to see you , and he was very distressed that you heard he was ill .
50:2:027:0	And he certainly was ill ; in fact , he almost died . But God had mercy on himâ€”and also on me , so that I would not have one sorrow after another .
50:2:028:0	So I am all the more anxious to send him back to you , for I know you will be glad to see him , and then I will not be so worried about you .
50:2:029:0	Welcome him in the Lord 's love and with great joy , and give him the honor that people like him deserve .
50:2:030:0	For he risked his life for the work of Christ , and he was at the point of death while doing for me what you could n't do from far away .
