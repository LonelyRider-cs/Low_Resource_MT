2:13:001:1	Dedication of the Firstborn
2:13:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
2:13:002:0	“ Dedicate to me every firstborn among the Israelites . The first offspring to be born , of both humans and animals , belongs to me . ”
2:13:003:0	So Moses said to the people , “ This is a day to remember forever — the day you left Egypt , the place of your slavery . Today the Lord has brought you out by the power of his mighty hand . ( Remember , eat no food containing yeast . )
2:13:004:0	On this day in early spring , in the month of Abib , you have been set free .
2:13:005:0	You must celebrate this event in this month each year after the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Hivites , and Jebusites . ( He swore to your ancestors that he would give you this land — a land flowing with milk and honey . )
2:13:006:0	For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast . Then on the seventh day , celebrate a feast to the Lord .
2:13:007:0	Eat bread without yeast during those seven days . In fact , there must be no yeast bread or any yeast at all found within the borders of your land during this time .
2:13:008:0	“ On the seventh day you must explain to your children , ‘ I am celebrating what the Lord did for me when I left Egypt . '
2:13:009:0	This annual festival will be a visible sign to you , like a mark branded on your hand or your forehead . Let it remind you always to recite this teaching of the Lord : ‘ With a strong hand , the Lord rescued you from Egypt . '
2:13:010:0	So observe the decree of this festival at the appointed time each year .
2:13:011:0	“ This is what you must do when the Lord fulfills the promise he swore to you and to your ancestors . When he gives you the land where the Canaanites now live ,
2:13:012:0	you must present all firstborn sons and firstborn male animals to the Lord , for they belong to him .
2:13:013:0	A firstborn donkey may be bought back from the Lord by presenting a lamb or young goat in its place . But if you do not buy it back , you must break its neck . However , you must buy back every firstborn son .
2:13:014:0	“ And in the future , your children will ask you , ‘ What does all this mean ? ' Then you will tell them , ‘ With the power of his mighty hand , the Lord brought us out of Egypt , the place of our slavery .
2:13:015:0	Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go , so the Lord killed all the firstborn males throughout the land of Egypt , both people and animals . That is why I now sacrifice all the firstborn males to the Lord — except that the firstborn sons are always bought back . '
2:13:002:1	Israel 's Wilderness Detour
2:13:016:0	This ceremony will be like a mark branded on your hand or your forehead . It is a reminder that the power of the Lord 's mighty hand brought us out of Egypt . ”
2:13:017:0	When Pharaoh finally let the people go , God did not lead them along the main road that runs through Philistine territory , even though that was the shortest route to the Promised Land . God said , “ If the people are faced with a battle , they might change their minds and return to Egypt . ”
2:13:018:0	So God led them in a roundabout way through the wilderness toward the Red Sea . Thus the Israelites left Egypt like an army ready for battle .
2:13:019:0	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear to do this . He said , “ God will certainly come to help you . When he does , you must take my bones with you from this place . ”
2:13:020:0	The Israelites left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness .
2:13:021:0	The Lord went ahead of them . He guided them during the day with a pillar of cloud , and he provided light at night with a pillar of fire . This allowed them to travel by day or by night .
2:13:022:0	And the Lord did not remove the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire from its place in front of the people .
