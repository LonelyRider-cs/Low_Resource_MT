2:23:001:1	A Call for Justice
2:23:001:0	“ You must not pass along false rumors . You must not cooperate with evil people by lying on the witness stand .
2:23:002:0	“ You must not follow the crowd in doing wrong . When you are called to testify in a dispute , do not be swayed by the crowd to twist justice .
2:23:003:0	And do not slant your testimony in favor of a person just because that person is poor .
2:23:004:0	“ If you come upon your enemy 's ox or donkey that has strayed away , take it back to its owner .
2:23:005:0	If you see that the donkey of someone who hates you has collapsed under its load , do not walk by . Instead , stop and help .
2:23:006:0	“ In a lawsuit , you must not deny justice to the poor .
2:23:007:0	“ Be sure never to charge anyone falsely with evil . Never sentence an innocent or blameless person to death , for I never declare a guilty person to be innocent .
2:23:008:0	“ Take no bribes , for a bribe makes you ignore something that you clearly see . A bribe makes even a righteous person twist the truth .
2:23:009:0	“ You must not oppress foreigners . You know what it 's like to be a foreigner , for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt .
2:23:010:0	“ Plant and harvest your crops for six years ,
2:23:011:0	but let the land be renewed and lie uncultivated during the seventh year . Then let the poor among you harvest whatever grows on its own . Leave the rest for wild animals to eat . The same applies to your vineyards and olive groves .
2:23:012:0	“ You have six days each week for your ordinary work , but on the seventh day you must stop working . This gives your ox and your donkey a chance to rest . It also allows your slaves and the foreigners living among you to be refreshed .
2:23:002:1	Three Annual Festivals
2:23:013:0	“ Pay close attention to all my instructions . You must not call on the name of any other gods . Do not even speak their names .
2:23:014:0	“ Each year you must celebrate three festivals in my honor .
2:23:015:0	First , celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread . For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast , just as I commanded you . Celebrate this festival annually at the appointed time in early spring , in the month of Abib , for that is the anniversary of your departure from Egypt . No one may appear before me without an offering .
2:23:016:0	“ Second , celebrate the Festival of Harvest , when you bring me the first crops of your harvest. “ Finally , celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest at the end of the harvest season , when you have harvested all the crops from your fields .
2:23:017:0	At these three times each year , every man in Israel must appear before the Sovereign , the Lord .
2:23:018:0	“ You must not offer the blood of my sacrificial offerings together with any baked goods containing yeast . And do not leave the fat from the festival offerings until the next morning .
2:23:003:1	A Promise of the
2:23:004:1	Lord
2:23:005:1	's Presence
2:23:019:0	“ As you harvest your crops , bring the very best of the first harvest to the house of the Lord your God. “ You must not cook a young goat in its mother 's milk .
2:23:020:0	“ See , I am sending an angel before you to protect you on your journey and lead you safely to the place I have prepared for you .
2:23:021:0	Pay close attention to him , and obey his instructions . Do not rebel against him , for he is my representative , and he will not forgive your rebellion .
2:23:022:0	But if you are careful to obey him , following all my instructions , then I will be an enemy to your enemies , and I will oppose those who oppose you .
2:23:023:0	For my angel will go before you and bring you into the land of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hivites , and Jebusites , so you may live there . And I will destroy them completely .
2:23:024:0	You must not worship the gods of these nations or serve them in any way or imitate their evil practices . Instead , you must utterly destroy them and smash their sacred pillars .
2:23:025:0	“ You must serve only the Lord your God . If you do , I will bless you with food and water , and I will protect you from illness .
2:23:026:0	There will be no miscarriages or infertility in your land , and I will give you long , full lives .
2:23:027:0	“ I will send my terror ahead of you and create panic among all the people whose lands you invade . I will make all your enemies turn and run .
2:23:028:0	I will send terror ahead of you to drive out the Hivites , Canaanites , and Hittites .
2:23:029:0	But I will not drive them out in a single year , because the land would become desolate and the wild animals would multiply and threaten you .
2:23:030:0	I will drive them out a little at a time until your population has increased enough to take possession of the land .
2:23:031:0	And I will fix your boundaries from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea , and from the eastern wilderness to the Euphrates River . I will hand over to you the people now living in the land , and you will drive them out ahead of you .
2:23:032:0	“ Make no treaties with them or their gods .
2:23:033:0	They must not live in your land , or they will cause you to sin against me . If you serve their gods , you will be caught in the trap of idolatry . ”
