2:14:001:0	Then the Lord gave these instructions to Moses :
2:14:002:0	“ Order the Israelites to turn back and camp by Pi-hahiroth between Migdol and the sea . Camp there along the shore , across from Baal-zephon .
2:14:003:0	Then Pharaoh will think , ‘ The Israelites are confused . They are trapped in the wilderness ! '
2:14:001:1	The Egyptians Pursue Israel
2:14:004:0	And once again I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and he will chase after you . I have planned this in order to display my glory through Pharaoh and his whole army . After this the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord ! ” So the Israelites camped there as they were told .
2:14:005:0	When word reached the king of Egypt that the Israelites had fled , Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds . “ What have we done , letting all those Israelite slaves get away ? ” they asked .
2:14:006:0	So Pharaoh harnessed his chariot and called up his troops .
2:14:007:0	He took with him 600 of Egypt 's best chariots , along with the rest of the chariots of Egypt , each with its commander .
2:14:008:0	The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , so he chased after the people of Israel , who had left with fists raised in defiance .
2:14:009:0	The Egyptians chased after them with all the forces in Pharaoh 's army — all his horses and chariots , his charioteers , and his troops . The Egyptians caught up with the people of Israel as they were camped beside the shore near Pi-hahiroth , across from Baal-zephon .
2:14:010:0	As Pharaoh approached , the people of Israel looked up and panicked when they saw the Egyptians overtaking them . They cried out to the Lord ,
2:14:011:0	and they said to Moses , “ Why did you bring us out here to die in the wilderness ? Were n't there enough graves for us in Egypt ? What have you done to us ? Why did you make us leave Egypt ?
2:14:012:0	Did n't we tell you this would happen while we were still in Egypt ? We said , ‘ Leave us alone ! Let us be slaves to the Egyptians . It 's better to be a slave in Egypt than a corpse in the wilderness ! ' ”
2:14:013:0	But Moses told the people , “ Do n't be afraid . Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today . The Egyptians you see today will never be seen again .
2:14:002:1	Escape through the Red Sea
2:14:014:0	The Lord himself will fight for you . Just stay calm . ”
2:14:015:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Why are you crying out to me ? Tell the people to get moving !
2:14:016:0	Pick up your staff and raise your hand over the sea . Divide the water so the Israelites can walk through the middle of the sea on dry ground .
2:14:017:0	And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they will charge in after the Israelites . My great glory will be displayed through Pharaoh and his troops , his chariots , and his charioteers .
2:14:018:0	When my glory is displayed through them , all Egypt will see my glory and know that I am the Lord ! ”
2:14:019:0	Then the angel of God , who had been leading the people of Israel , moved to the rear of the camp . The pillar of cloud also moved from the front and stood behind them .
2:14:020:0	The cloud settled between the Egyptian and Israelite camps . As darkness fell , the cloud turned to fire , lighting up the night . But the Egyptians and Israelites did not approach each other all night .
2:14:021:0	Then Moses raised his hand over the sea , and the Lord opened up a path through the water with a strong east wind . The wind blew all that night , turning the seabed into dry land .
2:14:022:0	So the people of Israel walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground , with walls of water on each side !
2:14:023:0	Then the Egyptians — all of Pharaoh 's horses , chariots , and charioteers — chased them into the middle of the sea .
2:14:024:0	But just before dawn the Lord looked down on the Egyptian army from the pillar of fire and cloud , and he threw their forces into total confusion .
2:14:025:0	He twisted their chariot wheels , making their chariots difficult to drive . “ Let 's get out of here — away from these Israelites ! ” the Egyptians shouted . “ The Lord is fighting for them against Egypt ! ”
2:14:026:0	When all the Israelites had reached the other side , the Lord said to Moses , “ Raise your hand over the sea again . Then the waters will rush back and cover the Egyptians and their chariots and charioteers . ”
2:14:027:0	So as the sun began to rise , Moses raised his hand over the sea , and the water rushed back into its usual place . The Egyptians tried to escape , but the Lord swept them into the sea .
2:14:028:0	Then the waters returned and covered all the chariots and charioteers — the entire army of Pharaoh . Of all the Egyptians who had chased the Israelites into the sea , not a single one survived .
2:14:029:0	But the people of Israel had walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground , as the water stood up like a wall on both sides .
2:14:030:0	That is how the Lord rescued Israel from the hand of the Egyptians that day . And the Israelites saw the bodies of the Egyptians washed up on the seashore .
2:14:031:0	When the people of Israel saw the mighty power that the Lord had unleashed against the Egyptians , they were filled with awe before him . They put their faith in the Lord and in his servant Moses .
