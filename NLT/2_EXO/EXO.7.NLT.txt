2:7:001:1	Aaron 's Staff Becomes a Serpent
2:7:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pay close attention to this . I will make you seem like God to Pharaoh , and your brother , Aaron , will be your prophet .
2:7:002:0	Tell Aaron everything I command you , and Aaron must command Pharaoh to let the people of Israel leave his country .
2:7:003:0	But I will make Pharaoh 's heart stubborn so I can multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt .
2:7:004:0	Even then Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you . So I will bring down my fist on Egypt . Then I will rescue my forces — my people , the Israelites — from the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment .
2:7:005:0	When I raise my powerful hand and bring out the Israelites , the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord . ”
2:7:006:0	So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded them .
2:7:007:0	Moses was eighty years old , and Aaron was eighty-three when they made their demands to Pharaoh .
2:7:008:0	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
2:7:009:0	“ Pharaoh will demand , ‘ Show me a miracle . ' When he does this , say to Aaron , ‘ Take your staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh , and it will become a serpent . ' ”
2:7:010:0	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did what the Lord had commanded them . Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials , and it became a serpent !
2:7:011:0	Then Pharaoh called in his own wise men and sorcerers , and these Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic .
2:7:012:0	They threw down their staffs , which also became serpents ! But then Aaron 's staff swallowed up their staffs .
2:7:002:1	A Plague of Blood
2:7:013:0	Pharaoh 's heart , however , remained hard . He still refused to listen , just as the Lord had predicted .
2:7:014:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh 's heart is stubborn , and he still refuses to let the people go .
2:7:015:0	So go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes down to the river . Stand on the bank of the Nile and meet him there . Be sure to take along the staff that turned into a snake .
2:7:016:0	Then announce to him , ‘ The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , has sent me to tell you , “ Let my people go , so they can worship me in the wilderness. ” Until now , you have refused to listen to him .
2:7:017:0	So this is what the Lord says : “ I will show you that I am the Lord. ” Look ! I will strike the water of the Nile with this staff in my hand , and the river will turn to blood .
2:7:018:0	The fish in it will die , and the river will stink . The Egyptians will not be able to drink any water from the Nile . ' ”
2:7:019:0	Then the Lord said to Moses : “ Tell Aaron , ‘ Take your staff and raise your hand over the waters of Egypt — all its rivers , canals , ponds , and all the reservoirs . Turn all the water to blood . Everywhere in Egypt the water will turn to blood , even the water stored in wooden bowls and stone pots . ' ”
2:7:020:0	So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them . As Pharaoh and all of his officials watched , Aaron raised his staff and struck the water of the Nile . Suddenly , the whole river turned to blood !
2:7:021:0	The fish in the river died , and the water became so foul that the Egyptians could n't drink it . There was blood everywhere throughout the land of Egypt .
2:7:022:0	But again the magicians of Egypt used their magic , and they , too , turned water into blood . So Pharaoh 's heart remained hard . He refused to listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had predicted .
2:7:023:0	Pharaoh returned to his palace and put the whole thing out of his mind .
2:7:024:0	Then all the Egyptians dug along the riverbank to find drinking water , for they could n't drink the water from the Nile .
2:7:025:0	Seven days passed from the time the Lord struck the Nile .
