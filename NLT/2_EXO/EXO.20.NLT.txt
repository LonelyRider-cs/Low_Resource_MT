2:20:001:1	Ten Commandments for the Covenant Community
2:20:001:0	Then God gave the people all these instructions :
2:20:002:0	“ I am the Lord your God , who rescued you from the land of Egypt , the place of your slavery .
2:20:003:0	“ You must not have any other god but me .
2:20:004:0	“ You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea .
2:20:005:0	You must not bow down to them or worship them , for I , the Lord your God , am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods . I lay the sins of the parents upon their children ; the entire family is affected—even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me .
2:20:006:0	But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those who love me and obey my commands .
2:20:007:0	“ You must not misuse the name of the Lord your God . The Lord will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name .
2:20:008:0	“ Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy .
2:20:009:0	You have six days each week for your ordinary work ,
2:20:010:0	but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God . On that day no one in your household may do any work . This includes you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , your livestock , and any foreigners living among you .
2:20:011:0	For in six days the Lord made the heavens , the earth , the sea , and everything in them ; but on the seventh day he rested . That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy .
2:20:012:0	“ Honor your father and mother . Then you will live a long , full life in the land the Lord your God is giving you .
2:20:013:0	“ You must not murder .
2:20:014:0	“ You must not commit adultery .
2:20:015:0	“ You must not steal .
2:20:016:0	“ You must not testify falsely against your neighbor .
2:20:017:0	“ You must not covet your neighbor 's house . You must not covet your neighbor 's wife , male or female servant , ox or donkey , or anything else that belongs to your neighbor . ”
2:20:018:0	When the people heard the thunder and the loud blast of the ram 's horn , and when they saw the flashes of lightning and the smoke billowing from the mountain , they stood at a distance , trembling with fear .
2:20:019:0	And they said to Moses , “ You speak to us , and we will listen . But do n't let God speak directly to us , or we will die ! ”
2:20:020:0	“ Do n't be afraid , ” Moses answered them , “ for God has come in this way to test you , and so that your fear of him will keep you from sinning ! ”
2:20:002:1	Proper Use of Altars
2:20:021:0	As the people stood in the distance , Moses approached the dark cloud where God was .
2:20:022:0	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Say this to the people of Israel : You saw for yourselves that I spoke to you from heaven .
2:20:023:0	Remember , you must not make any idols of silver or gold to rival me .
2:20:024:0	“ Build for me an altar made of earth , and offer your sacrifices to me—your burnt offerings and peace offerings , your sheep and goats , and your cattle . Build my altar wherever I cause my name to be remembered , and I will come to you and bless you .
2:20:025:0	If you use stones to build my altar , use only natural , uncut stones . Do not shape the stones with a tool , for that would make the altar unfit for holy use .
2:20:026:0	And do not approach my altar by going up steps . If you do , someone might look up under your clothing and see your nakedness .
