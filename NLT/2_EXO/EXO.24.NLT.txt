2:24:001:1	Israel Accepts the
2:24:002:1	Lord
2:24:003:1	's Covenant
2:24:001:0	Then the Lord instructed Moses : “ Come up here to me , and bring along Aaron , Nadab , Abihu , and seventy of Israel 's elders . All of you must worship from a distance .
2:24:002:0	Only Moses is allowed to come near to the Lord . The others must not come near , and none of the other people are allowed to climb up the mountain with him . ”
2:24:003:0	Then Moses went down to the people and repeated all the instructions and regulations the Lord had given him . All the people answered with one voice , “ We will do everything the Lord has commanded . ”
2:24:004:0	Then Moses carefully wrote down all the Lord 's instructions . Early the next morning Moses got up and built an altar at the foot of the mountain . He also set up twelve pillars , one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel .
2:24:005:0	Then he sent some of the young Israelite men to present burnt offerings and to sacrifice bulls as peace offerings to the Lord .
2:24:006:0	Moses drained half the blood from these animals into basins . The other half he splattered against the altar .
2:24:007:0	Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people . Again they all responded , “ We will do everything the Lord has commanded . We will obey . ”
2:24:008:0	Then Moses took the blood from the basins and splattered it over the people , declaring , “ Look , this blood confirms the covenant the Lord has made with you in giving you these instructions . ”
2:24:009:0	Then Moses , Aaron , Nadab , Abihu , and the seventy elders of Israel climbed up the mountain .
2:24:010:0	There they saw the God of Israel . Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli , as clear as the sky itself .
2:24:011:0	And though these nobles of Israel gazed upon God , he did not destroy them . In fact , they ate a covenant meal , eating and drinking in his presence !
2:24:012:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Come up to me on the mountain . Stay there , and I will give you the tablets of stone on which I have inscribed the instructions and commands so you can teach the people . ”
2:24:013:0	So Moses and his assistant Joshua set out , and Moses climbed up the mountain of God .
2:24:014:0	Moses told the elders , “ Stay here and wait for us until we come back . Aaron and Hur are here with you . If anyone has a dispute while I am gone , consult with them . ”
2:24:015:0	Then Moses climbed up the mountain , and the cloud covered it .
2:24:016:0	And the glory of the Lord settled down on Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it for six days . On the seventh day the Lord called to Moses from inside the cloud .
2:24:017:0	To the Israelites at the foot of the mountain , the glory of the Lord appeared at the summit like a consuming fire .
2:24:018:0	Then Moses disappeared into the cloud as he climbed higher up the mountain . He remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights .
