2:29:001:1	Dedication of the Priests
2:29:001:0	“ This is the ceremony you must follow when you consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests : Take a young bull and two rams with no defects .
2:29:002:0	Then , using choice wheat flour and no yeast , make loaves of bread , thin cakes mixed with olive oil , and wafers spread with oil .
2:29:003:0	Place them all in a single basket , and present them at the entrance of the Tabernacle , along with the young bull and the two rams .
2:29:004:0	“ Present Aaron and his sons at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and wash them with water .
2:29:005:0	Dress Aaron in his priestly garments—the tunic , the robe worn with the ephod , the ephod itself , and the chestpiece . Then wrap the decorative sash of the ephod around him .
2:29:006:0	Place the turban on his head , and fasten the sacred medallion to the turban .
2:29:007:0	Then anoint him by pouring the anointing oil over his head .
2:29:008:0	Next present his sons , and dress them in their tunics .
2:29:009:0	Wrap the sashes around the waists of Aaron and his sons , and put their special head coverings on them . Then the right to the priesthood will be theirs by law forever . In this way , you will ordain Aaron and his sons .
2:29:010:0	“ Bring the young bull to the entrance of the Tabernacle , where Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head .
2:29:011:0	Then slaughter the bull in the Lord 's presence at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
2:29:012:0	Put some of its blood on the horns of the altar with your finger , and pour out the rest at the base of the altar .
2:29:013:0	Take all the fat around the internal organs , the long lobe of the liver , and the two kidneys and the fat around them , and burn it all on the altar .
2:29:014:0	Then take the rest of the bull , including its hide , meat , and dung , and burn it outside the camp as a sin offering .
2:29:015:0	“ Next Aaron and his sons must lay their hands on the head of one of the rams .
2:29:016:0	Then slaughter the ram , and splatter its blood against all sides of the altar .
2:29:017:0	Cut the ram into pieces , and wash off the internal organs and the legs . Set them alongside the head and the other pieces of the body ,
2:29:018:0	then burn the entire animal on the altar . This is a burnt offering to the Lord ; it is a pleasing aroma , a special gift presented to the Lord .
2:29:019:0	“ Now take the other ram , and have Aaron and his sons lay their hands on its head .
2:29:020:0	Then slaughter it , and apply some of its blood to the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons . Also put it on the thumbs of their right hands and the big toes of their right feet . Splatter the rest of the blood against all sides of the altar .
2:29:021:0	Then take some of the blood from the altar and some of the anointing oil , and sprinkle it on Aaron and his sons and on their garments . In this way , they and their garments will be set apart as holy .
2:29:022:0	“ Since this is the ram for the ordination of Aaron and his sons , take the fat of the ram , including the fat of the broad tail , the fat around the internal organs , the long lobe of the liver , and the two kidneys and the fat around them , along with the right thigh .
2:29:023:0	Then take one round loaf of bread , one thin cake mixed with olive oil , and one wafer from the basket of bread without yeast that was placed in the Lord 's presence .
2:29:024:0	Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons to be lifted up as a special offering to the Lord .
2:29:025:0	Afterward take the various breads from their hands , and burn them on the altar along with the burnt offering . It is a pleasing aroma to the Lord , a special gift for him .
2:29:026:0	Then take the breast of Aaron 's ordination ram , and lift it up in the Lord 's presence as a special offering to him . Then keep it as your own portion .
2:29:027:0	“ Set aside the portions of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons . This includes the breast and the thigh that were lifted up before the Lord as a special offering .
2:29:028:0	In the future , whenever the people of Israel lift up a peace offering , a portion of it must be set aside for Aaron and his descendants . This is their permanent right , and it is a sacred offering from the Israelites to the Lord .
2:29:029:0	“ Aaron 's sacred garments must be preserved for his descendants who succeed him , and they will wear them when they are anointed and ordained .
2:29:030:0	The descendant who succeeds him as high priest will wear these clothes for seven days as he ministers in the Tabernacle and the Holy Place .
2:29:031:0	“ Take the ram used in the ordination ceremony , and boil its meat in a sacred place .
2:29:032:0	Then Aaron and his sons will eat this meat , along with the bread in the basket , at the Tabernacle entrance .
2:29:033:0	They alone may eat the meat and bread used for their purification in the ordination ceremony . No one else may eat them , for these things are set apart and holy .
2:29:034:0	If any of the ordination meat or bread remains until the morning , it must be burned . It may not be eaten , for it is holy .
2:29:035:0	“ This is how you will ordain Aaron and his sons to their offices , just as I have commanded you . The ordination ceremony will go on for seven days .
2:29:036:0	Each day you must sacrifice a young bull as a sin offering to purify them , making them right with the Lord . Afterward , cleanse the altar by purifying it ; make it holy by anointing it with oil .
2:29:037:0	Purify the altar , and consecrate it every day for seven days . After that , the altar will be absolutely holy , and whatever touches it will become holy .
2:29:038:0	“ These are the sacrifices you are to offer regularly on the altar . Each day , offer two lambs that are a year old ,
2:29:039:0	one in the morning and the other in the evening .
2:29:040:0	With one of them , offer two quarts of choice flour mixed with one quart of pure oil of pressed olives ; also , offer one quart of wine as a liquid offering .
2:29:041:0	Offer the other lamb in the evening , along with the same offerings of flour and wine as in the morning . It will be a pleasing aroma , a special gift presented to the Lord .
2:29:042:0	“ These burnt offerings are to be made each day from generation to generation . Offer them in the Lord 's presence at the Tabernacle entrance ; there I will meet with you and speak with you .
2:29:043:0	I will meet the people of Israel there , in the place made holy by my glorious presence .
2:29:044:0	Yes , I will consecrate the Tabernacle and the altar , and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests .
2:29:045:0	Then I will live among the people of Israel and be their God ,
2:29:046:0	and they will know that I am the Lord their God . I am the one who brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I could live among them . I am the Lord their God .
