2:16:001:1	Manna and Quail from Heaven
2:16:001:0	Then the whole community of Israel set out from Elim and journeyed into the wilderness of Sin , between Elim and Mount Sinai . They arrived there on the fifteenth day of the second month , one month after leaving the land of Egypt .
2:16:002:0	There , too , the whole community of Israel complained about Moses and Aaron .
2:16:003:0	“ If only the Lord had killed us back in Egypt , ” they moaned . “ There we sat around pots filled with meat and ate all the bread we wanted . But now you have brought us into this wilderness to starve us all to death . ”
2:16:004:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Look , I 'm going to rain down food from heaven for you . Each day the people can go out and pick up as much food as they need for that day . I will test them in this to see whether or not they will follow my instructions .
2:16:005:0	On the sixth day they will gather food , and when they prepare it , there will be twice as much as usual . ”
2:16:006:0	So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel , “ By evening you will realize it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt .
2:16:007:0	In the morning you will see the glory of the Lord , because he has heard your complaints , which are against him , not against us . What have we done that you should complain about us ? ”
2:16:008:0	Then Moses added , “ The Lord will give you meat to eat in the evening and bread to satisfy you in the morning , for he has heard all your complaints against him . What have we done ? Yes , your complaints are against the Lord , not against us . ”
2:16:009:0	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Announce this to the entire community of Israel : ‘ Present yourselves before the Lord , for he has heard your complaining . ' ”
2:16:010:0	And as Aaron spoke to the whole community of Israel , they looked out toward the wilderness . There they could see the awesome glory of the Lord in the cloud .
2:16:011:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
2:16:012:0	“ I have heard the Israelites ' complaints . Now tell them , ‘ In the evening you will have meat to eat , and in the morning you will have all the bread you want . Then you will know that I am the Lord your God . ' ”
2:16:013:0	That evening vast numbers of quail flew in and covered the camp . And the next morning the area around the camp was wet with dew .
2:16:014:0	When the dew evaporated , a flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed the ground .
2:16:015:0	The Israelites were puzzled when they saw it . “ What is it ? ” they asked each other . They had no idea what it was.And Moses told them , “ It is the food the Lord has given you to eat .
2:16:016:0	These are the Lord 's instructions : Each household should gather as much as it needs . Pick up two quarts for each person in your tent . ”
2:16:017:0	So the people of Israel did as they were told . Some gathered a lot , some only a little .
2:16:018:0	But when they measured it out , everyone had just enough . Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over , and those who gathered only a little had enough . Each family had just what it needed .
2:16:019:0	Then Moses told them , “ Do not keep any of it until morning . ”
2:16:020:0	But some of them did n't listen and kept some of it until morning . But by then it was full of maggots and had a terrible smell . Moses was very angry with them .
2:16:021:0	After this the people gathered the food morning by morning , each family according to its need . And as the sun became hot , the flakes they had not picked up melted and disappeared .
2:16:022:0	On the sixth day , they gathered twice as much as usual—four quarts for each person instead of two . Then all the leaders of the community came and asked Moses for an explanation .
2:16:023:0	He told them , “ This is what the Lord commanded : Tomorrow will be a day of complete rest , a holy Sabbath day set apart for the Lord . So bake or boil as much as you want today , and set aside what is left for tomorrow . ”
2:16:024:0	So they put some aside until morning , just as Moses had commanded . And in the morning the leftover food was wholesome and good , without maggots or odor .
2:16:025:0	Moses said , “ Eat this food today , for today is a Sabbath day dedicated to the Lord . There will be no food on the ground today .
2:16:026:0	You may gather the food for six days , but the seventh day is the Sabbath . There will be no food on the ground that day . ”
2:16:027:0	Some of the people went out anyway on the seventh day , but they found no food .
2:16:028:0	The Lord asked Moses , “ How long will these people refuse to obey my commands and instructions ?
2:16:029:0	They must realize that the Sabbath is the Lord 's gift to you . That is why he gives you a two-day supply on the sixth day , so there will be enough for two days . On the Sabbath day you must each stay in your place . Do not go out to pick up food on the seventh day . ”
2:16:030:0	So the people did not gather any food on the seventh day .
2:16:031:0	The Israelites called the food manna . It was white like coriander seed , and it tasted like honey wafers .
2:16:032:0	Then Moses said , “ This is what the Lord has commanded : Fill a two-quart container with manna to preserve it for your descendants . Then later generations will be able to see the food I gave you in the wilderness when I set you free from Egypt . ”
2:16:033:0	Moses said to Aaron , “ Get a jar and fill it with two quarts of manna . Then put it in a sacred place before the Lord to preserve it for all future generations . ”
2:16:034:0	Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded Moses . He eventually placed it in the Ark of the Covenant—in front of the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant .
2:16:035:0	So the people of Israel ate manna for forty years until they arrived at the land where they would settle . They ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan .
2:16:036:0	The container used to measure the manna was an omer , which was one-tenth of an ephah ; it held about two quarts .
