2:18:001:1	Jethro 's Visit to Moses
2:18:001:0	Moses ' father-in-law , Jethro , the priest of Midian , heard about everything God had done for Moses and his people , the Israelites . He heard especially about how the Lord had rescued them from Egypt .
2:18:002:0	Earlier , Moses had sent his wife , Zipporah , and his two sons back to Jethro , who had taken them in .
2:18:003:0	( Moses ' first son was named Gershom , for Moses had said when the boy was born , “ I have been a foreigner in a foreign land . ”
2:18:004:0	His second son was named Eliezer , for Moses had said , “ The God of my ancestors was my helper ; he rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh . ” )
2:18:005:0	Jethro , Moses ' father-in-law , now came to visit Moses in the wilderness . He brought Moses ' wife and two sons with him , and they arrived while Moses and the people were camped near the mountain of God .
2:18:006:0	Jethro had sent a message to Moses , saying , “ I , Jethro , your father-in-law , am coming to see you with your wife and your two sons . ”
2:18:007:0	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law . He bowed low and kissed him . They asked about each other 's welfare and then went into Moses ' tent .
2:18:008:0	Moses told his father-in-law everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and Egypt on behalf of Israel . He also told about all the hardships they had experienced along the way and how the Lord had rescued his people from all their troubles .
2:18:009:0	Jethro was delighted when he heard about all the good things the Lord had done for Israel as he rescued them from the hand of the Egyptians .
2:18:010:0	“ Praise the Lord , ” Jethro said , “ for he has rescued you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh . Yes , he has rescued Israel from the powerful hand of Egypt !
2:18:011:0	I know now that the Lord is greater than all other gods , because he rescued his people from the oppression of the proud Egyptians . ”
2:18:002:1	Jethro 's Wise Advice
2:18:012:0	Then Jethro , Moses ' father-in-law , brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God . Aaron and all the elders of Israel came out and joined him in a sacrificial meal in God 's presence .
2:18:013:0	The next day , Moses took his seat to hear the people 's disputes against each other . They waited before him from morning till evening .
2:18:014:0	When Moses ' father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people , he asked , “ What are you really accomplishing here ? Why are you trying to do all this alone while everyone stands around you from morning till evening ? ”
2:18:015:0	Moses replied , “ Because the people come to me to get a ruling from God .
2:18:016:0	When a dispute arises , they come to me , and I am the one who settles the case between the quarreling parties . I inform the people of God 's decrees and give them his instructions . ”
2:18:017:0	“ This is not good ! ” Moses ' father-in-law exclaimed .
2:18:018:0	“ You 're going to wear yourself out—and the people , too . This job is too heavy a burden for you to handle all by yourself .
2:18:019:0	Now listen to me , and let me give you a word of advice , and may God be with you . You should continue to be the people 's representative before God , bringing their disputes to him .
2:18:020:0	Teach them God 's decrees , and give them his instructions . Show them how to conduct their lives .
2:18:021:0	But select from all the people some capable , honest men who fear God and hate bribes . Appoint them as leaders over groups of one thousand , one hundred , fifty , and ten .
2:18:022:0	They should always be available to solve the people 's common disputes , but have them bring the major cases to you . Let the leaders decide the smaller matters themselves . They will help you carry the load , making the task easier for you .
2:18:023:0	If you follow this advice , and if God commands you to do so , then you will be able to endure the pressures , and all these people will go home in peace . ”
2:18:024:0	Moses listened to his father-in-law 's advice and followed his suggestions .
2:18:025:0	He chose capable men from all over Israel and appointed them as leaders over the people . He put them in charge of groups of one thousand , one hundred , fifty , and ten .
2:18:026:0	These men were always available to solve the people 's common disputes . They brought the major cases to Moses , but they took care of the smaller matters themselves .
2:18:027:0	Soon after this , Moses said good-bye to his father-in-law , who returned to his own land .
