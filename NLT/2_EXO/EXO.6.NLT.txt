2:6:001:1	Promises of Deliverance
2:6:001:0	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh . When he feels the force of my strong hand , he will let the people go . In fact , he will force them to leave his land ! ”
2:6:002:0	And God said to Moses , “ I am Yahweh — ‘ the Lord . '
2:6:003:0	I appeared to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob as El-Shaddai — ‘ God Almighty ' — but I did not reveal my name , Yahweh , to them .
2:6:004:0	And I reaffirmed my covenant with them . Under its terms , I promised to give them the land of Canaan , where they were living as foreigners .
2:6:005:0	You can be sure that I have heard the groans of the people of Israel , who are now slaves to the Egyptians . And I am well aware of my covenant with them .
2:6:006:0	“ Therefore , say to the people of Israel : ‘ I am the Lord . I will free you from your oppression and will rescue you from your slavery in Egypt . I will redeem you with a powerful arm and great acts of judgment .
2:6:007:0	I will claim you as my own people , and I will be your God . Then you will know that I am the Lord your God who has freed you from your oppression in Egypt .
2:6:008:0	I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I will give it to you as your very own possession . I am the Lord ! ' ”
2:6:009:0	So Moses told the people of Israel what the Lord had said , but they refused to listen anymore . They had become too discouraged by the brutality of their slavery .
2:6:010:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
2:6:011:0	“ Go back to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and tell him to let the people of Israel leave his country . ”
2:6:012:0	“ But Lord ! ” Moses objected . “ My own people wo n't listen to me anymore . How can I expect Pharaoh to listen ? I 'm such a clumsy speaker ! ”
