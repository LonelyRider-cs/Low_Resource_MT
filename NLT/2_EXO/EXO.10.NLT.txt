2:10:001:1	A Plague of Locusts
2:10:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Return to Pharaoh and make your demands again . I have made him and his officials stubborn so I can display my miraculous signs among them .
2:10:002:0	I 've also done it so you can tell your children and grandchildren about how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and about the signs I displayed among them—and so you will know that I am the Lord . ”
2:10:003:0	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : How long will you refuse to submit to me ? Let my people go , so they can worship me .
2:10:004:0	If you refuse , watch out ! For tomorrow I will bring a swarm of locusts on your country .
2:10:005:0	They will cover the land so that you wo n't be able to see the ground . They will devour what little is left of your crops after the hailstorm , including all the trees growing in the fields .
2:10:006:0	They will overrun your palaces and the homes of your officials and all the houses in Egypt . Never in the history of Egypt have your ancestors seen a plague like this one ! ” And with that , Moses turned and left Pharaoh .
2:10:007:0	Pharaoh 's officials now came to Pharaoh and appealed to him . “ How long will you let this man hold us hostage ? Let the men go to worship the Lord their God ! Do n't you realize that Egypt lies in ruins ? ”
2:10:008:0	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh . “ All right , ” he told them , “ go and worship the Lord your God . But who exactly will be going with you ? ”
2:10:009:0	Moses replied , “ We will all go—young and old , our sons and daughters , and our flocks and herds . We must all join together in celebrating a festival to the Lord . ”
2:10:010:0	Pharaoh retorted , “ The Lord will certainly need to be with you if I let you take your little ones ! I can see through your evil plan .
2:10:011:0	Never ! Only the men may go and worship the Lord , since that is what you requested. ” And Pharaoh threw them out of the palace .
2:10:012:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Raise your hand over the land of Egypt to bring on the locusts . Let them cover the land and devour every plant that survived the hailstorm . ”
2:10:013:0	So Moses raised his staff over Egypt , and the Lord caused an east wind to blow over the land all that day and through the night . When morning arrived , the east wind had brought the locusts .
2:10:014:0	And the locusts swarmed over the whole land of Egypt , settling in dense swarms from one end of the country to the other . It was the worst locust plague in Egyptian history , and there has never been another one like it .
2:10:015:0	For the locusts covered the whole country and darkened the land . They devoured every plant in the fields and all the fruit on the trees that had survived the hailstorm . Not a single leaf was left on the trees and plants throughout the land of Egypt .
2:10:016:0	Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron . “ I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you , ” he confessed .
2:10:017:0	“ Forgive my sin , just this once , and plead with the Lord your God to take away this death from me . ”
2:10:018:0	So Moses left Pharaoh 's court and pleaded with the Lord .
2:10:019:0	The Lord responded by shifting the wind , and the strong west wind blew the locusts into the Red Sea . Not a single locust remained in all the land of Egypt .
2:10:002:1	A Plague of Darkness
2:10:020:0	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh 's heart again , so he refused to let the people go .
2:10:021:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Lift your hand toward heaven , and the land of Egypt will be covered with a darkness so thick you can feel it . ”
2:10:022:0	So Moses lifted his hand to the sky , and a deep darkness covered the entire land of Egypt for three days .
2:10:023:0	During all that time the people could not see each other , and no one moved . But there was light as usual where the people of Israel lived .
2:10:024:0	Finally , Pharaoh called for Moses . “ Go and worship the Lord , ” he said . “ But leave your flocks and herds here . You may even take your little ones with you . ”
2:10:025:0	“ No , ” Moses said , “ you must provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord our God .
2:10:026:0	All our livestock must go with us , too ; not a hoof can be left behind . We must choose our sacrifices for the Lord our God from among these animals . And we wo n't know how we are to worship the Lord until we get there . ”
2:10:027:0	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh 's heart once more , and he would not let them go .
2:10:028:0	“ Get out of here ! ” Pharaoh shouted at Moses . “ I 'm warning you . Never come back to see me again ! The day you see my face , you will die ! ”
2:10:029:0	“ Very well , ” Moses replied . “ I will never see your face again . ”
