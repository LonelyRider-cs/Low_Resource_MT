2:3:001:1	Moses and the Burning Bush
2:3:001:0	One day Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law , Jethro , the priest of Midian . He led the flock far into the wilderness and came to Sinai , the mountain of God .
2:3:002:0	There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from the middle of a bush . Moses stared in amazement . Though the bush was engulfed in flames , it did n't burn up .
2:3:003:0	“ This is amazing , ” Moses said to himself . “ Why is n't that bush burning up ? I must go see it . ”
2:3:004:0	When the Lord saw Moses coming to take a closer look , God called to him from the middle of the bush , “ Moses ! Moses ! ” “ Here I am ! ” Moses replied .
2:3:005:0	“ Do not come any closer , ” the Lord warned . “ Take off your sandals , for you are standing on holy ground .
2:3:006:0	I am the God of your father — the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ” When Moses heard this , he covered his face because he was afraid to look at God .
2:3:007:0	Then the Lord told him , “ I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt . I have heard their cries of distress because of their harsh slave drivers . Yes , I am aware of their suffering .
2:3:008:0	So I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and lead them out of Egypt into their own fertile and spacious land . It is a land flowing with milk and honey — the land where the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites now live .
2:3:009:0	Look ! The cry of the people of Israel has reached me , and I have seen how harshly the Egyptians abuse them .
2:3:010:0	Now go , for I am sending you to Pharaoh . You must lead my people Israel out of Egypt . ”
2:3:011:0	But Moses protested to God , “ Who am I to appear before Pharaoh ? Who am I to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt ? ”
2:3:012:0	God answered , “ I will be with you . And this is your sign that I am the one who has sent you : When you have brought the people out of Egypt , you will worship God at this very mountain . ”
2:3:013:0	But Moses protested , “ If I go to the people of Israel and tell them , ‘ The God of your ancestors has sent me to you , ' they will ask me , ‘ What is his name ? ' Then what should I tell them ? ”
2:3:014:0	God replied to Moses , “ I Am Who I Am . Say this to the people of Israel : I Am has sent me to you . ”
2:3:015:0	God also said to Moses , “ Say this to the people of Israel : Yahweh , the God of your ancestors — the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob — has sent me to you.This is my eternal name , my name to remember for all generations .
2:3:016:0	“ Now go and call together all the elders of Israel . Tell them , ‘ Yahweh , the God of your ancestors — the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob — has appeared to me . He told me , “ I have been watching closely , and I see how the Egyptians are treating you .
2:3:017:0	I have promised to rescue you from your oppression in Egypt . I will lead you to a land flowing with milk and honey — the land where the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites now live . ” '
2:3:018:0	“ The elders of Israel will accept your message . Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt and tell him , ‘ The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , has met with us . So please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord , our God . '
2:3:019:0	“ But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand forces him .
2:3:020:0	So I will raise my hand and strike the Egyptians , performing all kinds of miracles among them . Then at last he will let you go .
2:3:021:0	And I will cause the Egyptians to look favorably on you . They will give you gifts when you go so you will not leave empty-handed .
2:3:022:0	Every Israelite woman will ask for articles of silver and gold and fine clothing from her Egyptian neighbors and from the foreign women in their houses . You will dress your sons and daughters with these , stripping the Egyptians of their wealth . ”
