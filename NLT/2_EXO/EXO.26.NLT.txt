2:26:001:1	Plans for the Tabernacle
2:26:001:0	“ Make the Tabernacle from ten curtains of finely woven linen . Decorate the curtains with blue , purple , and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim .
2:26:002:0	These ten curtains must all be exactly the same size—42 feet long and 6 feet wide .
2:26:003:0	Join five of these curtains together to make one long curtain , then join the other five into a second long curtain .
2:26:004:0	Put loops of blue yarn along the edge of the last curtain in each set .
2:26:005:0	The fifty loops along the edge of one curtain are to match the fifty loops along the edge of the other curtain .
2:26:006:0	Then make fifty gold clasps and fasten the long curtains together with the clasps . In this way , the Tabernacle will be made of one continuous piece .
2:26:007:0	“ Make eleven curtains of goat-hair cloth to serve as a tent covering for the Tabernacle .
2:26:008:0	These eleven curtains must all be exactly the same size—45 feet long and 6 feet wide .
2:26:009:0	Join five of these curtains together to make one long curtain , and join the other six into a second long curtain . Allow 3 feet of material from the second set of curtains to hang over the front of the sacred tent .
2:26:010:0	Make fifty loops for one edge of each large curtain .
2:26:011:0	Then make fifty bronze clasps , and fasten the loops of the long curtains with the clasps . In this way , the tent covering will be made of one continuous piece .
2:26:012:0	The remaining 3 feet of this tent covering will be left to hang over the back of the Tabernacle .
2:26:013:0	Allow 18 inches of remaining material to hang down over each side , so the Tabernacle is completely covered .
2:26:014:0	Complete the tent covering with a protective layer of tanned ram skins and a layer of fine goatskin leather .
2:26:015:0	“ For the framework of the Tabernacle , construct frames of acacia wood .
2:26:016:0	Each frame must be 15 feet high and 27 inches wide ,
2:26:017:0	with two pegs under each frame . Make all the frames identical .
2:26:018:0	Make twenty of these frames to support the curtains on the south side of the Tabernacle .
2:26:019:0	Also make forty silver bases—two bases under each frame , with the pegs fitting securely into the bases .
2:26:020:0	For the north side of the Tabernacle , make another twenty frames ,
2:26:021:0	with their forty silver bases , two bases under each frame .
2:26:022:0	Make six frames for the rear—the west side of the Tabernacle—
2:26:023:0	along with two additional frames to reinforce the rear corners of the Tabernacle .
2:26:024:0	These corner frames will be matched at the bottom and firmly attached at the top with a single ring , forming a single corner unit . Make both of these corner units the same way .
2:26:025:0	So there will be eight frames at the rear of the Tabernacle , set in sixteen silver bases—two bases under each frame .
2:26:026:0	“ Make crossbars of acacia wood to link the frames , five crossbars for the north side of the Tabernacle
2:26:027:0	and five for the south side . Also make five crossbars for the rear of the Tabernacle , which will face west .
2:26:028:0	The middle crossbar , attached halfway up the frames , will run all the way from one end of the Tabernacle to the other .
2:26:029:0	Overlay the frames with gold , and make gold rings to hold the crossbars . Overlay the crossbars with gold as well .
2:26:030:0	“ Set up this Tabernacle according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain .
2:26:031:0	“ For the inside of the Tabernacle , make a special curtain of finely woven linen . Decorate it with blue , purple , and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim .
2:26:032:0	Hang this curtain on gold hooks attached to four posts of acacia wood . Overlay the posts with gold , and set them in four silver bases .
2:26:033:0	Hang the inner curtain from clasps , and put the Ark of the Covenant in the room behind it . This curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place .
2:26:034:0	“ Then put the Ark 's cover—the place of atonement—on top of the Ark of the Covenant inside the Most Holy Place .
2:26:035:0	Place the table outside the inner curtain on the north side of the Tabernacle , and place the lampstand across the room on the south side .
2:26:036:0	“ Make another curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent . Make it of finely woven linen and embroider it with exquisite designs , using blue , purple , and scarlet thread .
2:26:037:0	Craft five posts from acacia wood . Overlay them with gold , and hang the curtain from them with gold hooks . Cast five bronze bases for the posts .
