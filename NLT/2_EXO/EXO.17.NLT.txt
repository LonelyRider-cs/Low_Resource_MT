2:17:001:1	Water from the Rock
2:17:001:0	At the Lord 's command , the whole community of Israel left the wilderness of Sin and moved from place to place . Eventually they camped at Rephidim , but there was no water there for the people to drink .
2:17:002:0	So once more the people complained against Moses . “ Give us water to drink ! ” they demanded. “ Quiet ! ” Moses replied . “ Why are you complaining against me ? And why are you testing the Lord ? ”
2:17:003:0	But tormented by thirst , they continued to argue with Moses . “ Why did you bring us out of Egypt ? Are you trying to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? ”
2:17:004:0	Then Moses cried out to the Lord , “ What should I do with these people ? They are ready to stone me ! ”
2:17:005:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ Walk out in front of the people . Take your staff , the one you used when you struck the water of the Nile , and call some of the elders of Israel to join you .
2:17:006:0	I will stand before you on the rock at Mount Sinai . Strike the rock , and water will come gushing out . Then the people will be able to drink. ” So Moses struck the rock as he was told , and water gushed out as the elders looked on .
2:17:002:1	Israel Defeats the Amalekites
2:17:007:0	Moses named the place Massah ( which means “ test ” ) and Meribah ( which means “ arguing ” ) because the people of Israel argued with Moses and tested the Lord by saying , “ Is the Lord here with us or not ? ”
2:17:008:0	While the people of Israel were still at Rephidim , the warriors of Amalek attacked them .
2:17:009:0	Moses commanded Joshua , “ Choose some men to go out and fight the army of Amalek for us . Tomorrow , I will stand at the top of the hill , holding the staff of God in my hand . ”
2:17:010:0	So Joshua did what Moses had commanded and fought the army of Amalek . Meanwhile , Moses , Aaron , and Hur climbed to the top of a nearby hill .
2:17:011:0	As long as Moses held up the staff in his hand , the Israelites had the advantage . But whenever he dropped his hand , the Amalekites gained the advantage .
2:17:012:0	Moses ' arms soon became so tired he could no longer hold them up . So Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on . Then they stood on each side of Moses , holding up his hands . So his hands held steady until sunset .
2:17:013:0	As a result , Joshua overwhelmed the army of Amalek in battle .
2:17:014:0	After the victory , the Lord instructed Moses , “ Write this down on a scroll as a permanent reminder , and read it aloud to Joshua : I will erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven . ”
2:17:015:0	Moses built an altar there and named it Yahweh-Nissi ( which means “ the Lord is my banner ” ) .
2:17:016:0	He said , “ They have raised their fist against the Lord 's throne , so now the Lord will be at war with Amalek generation after generation . ”
