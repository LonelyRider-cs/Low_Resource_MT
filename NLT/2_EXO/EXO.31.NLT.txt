2:31:001:1	Craftsmen : Bezalel and Oholiab
2:31:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
2:31:002:0	“ Look , I have specifically chosen Bezalel son of Uri , grandson of Hur , of the tribe of Judah .
2:31:003:0	I have filled him with the Spirit of God , giving him great wisdom , ability , and expertise in all kinds of crafts .
2:31:004:0	He is a master craftsman , expert in working with gold , silver , and bronze .
2:31:005:0	He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood . He is a master at every craft !
2:31:006:0	“ And I have personally appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , to be his assistant . Moreover , I have given special skill to all the gifted craftsmen so they can make all the things I have commanded you to make :
2:31:007:0	the Tabernacle ; the Ark of the Covenant ; the Ark 's cover—the place of atonement ; all the furnishings of the Tabernacle ;
2:31:008:0	the table and its utensils ; the pure gold lampstand with all its accessories ; the incense altar ;
2:31:009:0	the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils ; the washbasin with its stand ;
2:31:010:0	the beautifully stitched garments—the sacred garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests ;
2:31:002:1	Instructions for the Sabbath
2:31:011:0	the anointing oil ; the fragrant incense for the Holy Place.The craftsmen must make everything as I have commanded you . ”
2:31:012:0	The Lord then gave these instructions to Moses :
2:31:013:0	“ Tell the people of Israel : ‘ Be careful to keep my Sabbath day , for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you from generation to generation . It is given so you may know that I am the Lord , who makes you holy .
2:31:014:0	You must keep the Sabbath day , for it is a holy day for you . Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death ; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community .
2:31:015:0	You have six days each week for your ordinary work , but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest , a holy day dedicated to the Lord . Anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death .
2:31:016:0	The people of Israel must keep the Sabbath day by observing it from generation to generation . This is a covenant obligation for all time .
2:31:017:0	It is a permanent sign of my covenant with the people of Israel . For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , but on the seventh day he stopped working and was refreshed . ' ”
2:31:018:0	When the Lord finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai , he gave him the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant , written by the finger of God .
