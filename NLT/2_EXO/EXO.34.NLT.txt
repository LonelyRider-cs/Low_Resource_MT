2:34:001:1	A New Copy of the Covenant
2:34:001:0	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones . I will write on them the same words that were on the tablets you smashed .
2:34:002:0	Be ready in the morning to climb up Mount Sinai and present yourself to me on the top of the mountain .
2:34:003:0	No one else may come with you . In fact , no one is to appear anywhere on the mountain . Do not even let the flocks or herds graze near the mountain . ”
2:34:004:0	So Moses chiseled out two tablets of stone like the first ones . Early in the morning he climbed Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded him , and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands .
2:34:005:0	Then the Lord came down in a cloud and stood there with him ; and he called out his own name , Yahweh .
2:34:006:0	The Lord passed in front of Moses , calling out , “ Yahweh ! The Lord ! The God of compassion and mercy ! I am slow to angerand filled with unfailing love and faithfulness .
2:34:007:0	I lavish unfailing love to a thousand generations.I forgive iniquity , rebellion , and sin.But I do not excuse the guilty.I lay the sins of the parents upon their children and grandchildren ; the entire family is affected — even children in the third and fourth generations . ”
2:34:008:0	Moses immediately threw himself to the ground and worshiped .
2:34:009:0	And he said , “ O Lord , if it is true that I have found favor with you , then please travel with us . Yes , this is a stubborn and rebellious people , but please forgive our iniquity and our sins . Claim us as your own special possession . ”
2:34:010:0	The Lord replied , “ Listen , I am making a covenant with you in the presence of all your people . I will perform miracles that have never been performed anywhere in all the earth or in any nation . And all the people around you will see the power of the Lord — the awesome power I will display for you .
2:34:011:0	But listen carefully to everything I command you today . Then I will go ahead of you and drive out the Amorites , Canaanites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
2:34:012:0	“ Be very careful never to make a treaty with the people who live in the land where you are going . If you do , you will follow their evil ways and be trapped .
2:34:013:0	Instead , you must break down their pagan altars , smash their sacred pillars , and cut down their Asherah poles .
2:34:014:0	You must worship no other gods , for the Lord , whose very name is Jealous , is a God who is jealous about his relationship with you .
2:34:015:0	“ You must not make a treaty of any kind with the people living in the land . They lust after their gods , offering sacrifices to them . They will invite you to join them in their sacrificial meals , and you will go with them .
2:34:016:0	Then you will accept their daughters , who sacrifice to other gods , as wives for your sons . And they will seduce your sons to commit adultery against me by worshiping other gods .
2:34:017:0	You must not make any gods of molten metal for yourselves .
2:34:018:0	“ You must celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread . For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast , just as I commanded you . Celebrate this festival annually at the appointed time in early spring , in the month of Abib , for that is the anniversary of your departure from Egypt .
2:34:019:0	“ The firstborn of every animal belongs to me , including the firstborn males from your herds of cattle and your flocks of sheep and goats .
2:34:020:0	A firstborn donkey may be bought back from the Lord by presenting a lamb or young goat in its place . But if you do not buy it back , you must break its neck . However , you must buy back every firstborn son. “ No one may appear before me without an offering .
2:34:021:0	“ You have six days each week for your ordinary work , but on the seventh day you must stop working , even during the seasons of plowing and harvest .
2:34:022:0	“ You must celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the first crop of the wheat harvest , and celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest at the end of the harvest season .
2:34:023:0	Three times each year every man in Israel must appear before the Sovereign , the Lord , the God of Israel .
2:34:024:0	I will drive out the other nations ahead of you and expand your territory , so no one will covet and conquer your land while you appear before the Lord your God three times each year .
2:34:025:0	“ You must not offer the blood of my sacrificial offerings together with any baked goods containing yeast . And none of the meat of the Passover sacrifice may be kept over until the next morning .
2:34:026:0	“ As you harvest your crops , bring the very best of the first harvest to the house of the Lord your God. “ You must not cook a young goat in its mother 's milk . ”
2:34:027:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write down all these instructions , for they represent the terms of the covenant I am making with you and with Israel . ”
2:34:028:0	Moses remained there on the mountain with the Lord forty days and forty nights . In all that time he ate no bread and drank no water . And the Lord wrote the terms of the covenant — the Ten Commandments — on the stone tablets .
2:34:029:0	When Moses came down Mount Sinai carrying the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant , he was n't aware that his face had become radiant because he had spoken to the Lord .
2:34:030:0	So when Aaron and the people of Israel saw the radiance of Moses ' face , they were afraid to come near him .
2:34:031:0	But Moses called out to them and asked Aaron and all the leaders of the community to come over , and he talked with them .
2:34:032:0	Then all the people of Israel approached him , and Moses gave them all the instructions the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai .
2:34:033:0	When Moses finished speaking with them , he covered his face with a veil .
2:34:034:0	But whenever he went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with the Lord , he would remove the veil until he came out again . Then he would give the people whatever instructions the Lord had given him ,
2:34:035:0	and the people of Israel would see the radiant glow of his face . So he would put the veil over his face until he returned to speak with the Lord .
