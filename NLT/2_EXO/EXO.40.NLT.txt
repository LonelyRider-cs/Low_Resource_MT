2:40:001:1	The Tabernacle Completed
2:40:001:0	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
2:40:002:0	“ Set up the Tabernacle on the first day of the new year .
2:40:003:0	Place the Ark of the Covenant inside , and install the inner curtain to enclose the Ark within the Most Holy Place .
2:40:004:0	Then bring in the table , and arrange the utensils on it . And bring in the lampstand , and set up the lamps .
2:40:005:0	“ Place the gold incense altar in front of the Ark of the Covenant . Then hang the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle .
2:40:006:0	Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the Tabernacle entrance .
2:40:007:0	Set the washbasin between the Tabernacle and the altar , and fill it with water .
2:40:008:0	Then set up the courtyard around the outside of the tent , and hang the curtain for the courtyard entrance .
2:40:009:0	“ Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all its furnishings to consecrate them and make them holy .
2:40:010:0	Anoint the altar of burnt offering and its utensils to consecrate them . Then the altar will become absolutely holy .
2:40:011:0	Next anoint the washbasin and its stand to consecrate them .
2:40:012:0	“ Present Aaron and his sons at the entrance of the Tabernacle , and wash them with water .
2:40:013:0	Dress Aaron with the sacred garments and anoint him , consecrating him to serve me as a priest .
2:40:014:0	Then present his sons and dress them in their tunics .
2:40:015:0	Anoint them as you did their father , so they may also serve me as priests . With their anointing , Aaron 's descendants are set apart for the priesthood forever , from generation to generation . ”
2:40:016:0	Moses proceeded to do everything just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:017:0	So the Tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year .
2:40:018:0	Moses erected the Tabernacle by setting down its bases , inserting the frames , attaching the crossbars , and setting up the posts .
2:40:019:0	Then he spread the coverings over the Tabernacle framework and put on the protective layers , just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:020:0	He took the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant and placed them inside the Ark . Then he attached the carrying poles to the Ark , and he set the Ark 's cover—the place of atonement—on top of it .
2:40:021:0	Then he brought the Ark of the Covenant into the Tabernacle and hung the inner curtain to shield it from view , just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:022:0	Next Moses placed the table in the Tabernacle , along the north side of the Holy Place , just outside the inner curtain .
2:40:023:0	And he arranged the Bread of the Presence on the table before the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:024:0	He set the lampstand in the Tabernacle across from the table on the south side of the Holy Place .
2:40:025:0	Then he lit the lamps in the Lord 's presence , just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:026:0	He also placed the gold incense altar in the Tabernacle , in the Holy Place in front of the inner curtain .
2:40:027:0	On it he burned the fragrant incense , just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:028:0	He hung the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle ,
2:40:029:0	and he placed the altar of burnt offering near the Tabernacle entrance . On it he offered a burnt offering and a grain offering , just as the Lord had commanded him .
2:40:030:0	Next Moses placed the washbasin between the Tabernacle and the altar . He filled it with water so the priests could wash themselves .
2:40:031:0	Moses and Aaron and Aaron 's sons used water from it to wash their hands and feet .
2:40:032:0	Whenever they approached the altar and entered the Tabernacle , they washed themselves , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:40:002:1	The
2:40:003:1	Lord
2:40:004:1	's Glory Fills the Tabernacle
2:40:033:0	Then he hung the curtains forming the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar . And he set up the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard . So at last Moses finished the work .
2:40:034:0	Then the cloud covered the Tabernacle , and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle .
2:40:035:0	Moses could no longer enter the Tabernacle because the cloud had settled down over it , and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle .
2:40:036:0	Now whenever the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle , the people of Israel would set out on their journey , following it .
2:40:037:0	But if the cloud did not rise , they remained where they were until it lifted .
2:40:038:0	The cloud of the Lord hovered over the Tabernacle during the day , and at night fire glowed inside the cloud so the whole family of Israel could see it . This continued throughout all their journeys .
