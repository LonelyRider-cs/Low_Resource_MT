2:4:001:1	Signs of the
2:4:002:1	Lord
2:4:003:1	's Power
2:4:001:0	But Moses protested again , “ What if they wo n't believe me or listen to me ? What if they say , ‘ The Lord never appeared to you ' ? ”
2:4:002:0	Then the Lord asked him , “ What is that in your hand ? ” “ A shepherd 's staff , ” Moses replied .
2:4:003:0	“ Throw it down on the ground , ” the Lord told him . So Moses threw down the staff , and it turned into a snake ! Moses jumped back .
2:4:004:0	Then the Lord told him , “ Reach out and grab its tail. ” So Moses reached out and grabbed it , and it turned back into a shepherd 's staff in his hand .
2:4:005:0	“ Perform this sign , ” the Lord told him . “ Then they will believe that the Lord , the God of their ancestors—the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob—really has appeared to you . ”
2:4:006:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Now put your hand inside your cloak. ” So Moses put his hand inside his cloak , and when he took it out again , his hand was white as snow with a severe skin disease .
2:4:007:0	“ Now put your hand back into your cloak , ” the Lord said . So Moses put his hand back in , and when he took it out again , it was as healthy as the rest of his body .
2:4:008:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ If they do not believe you and are not convinced by the first miraculous sign , they will be convinced by the second sign .
2:4:009:0	And if they do n't believe you or listen to you even after these two signs , then take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry ground . When you do , the water from the Nile will turn to blood on the ground . ”
2:4:010:0	But Moses pleaded with the Lord , “ O Lord , I 'm not very good with words . I never have been , and I 'm not now , even though you have spoken to me . I get tongue-tied , and my words get tangled . ”
2:4:011:0	Then the Lord asked Moses , “ Who makes a person 's mouth ? Who decides whether people speak or do not speak , hear or do not hear , see or do not see ? Is it not I , the Lord ?
2:4:012:0	Now go ! I will be with you as you speak , and I will instruct you in what to say . ”
2:4:013:0	But Moses again pleaded , “ Lord , please ! Send anyone else . ”
2:4:014:0	Then the Lord became angry with Moses . “ All right , ” he said . “ What about your brother , Aaron the Levite ? I know he speaks well . And look ! He is on his way to meet you now . He will be delighted to see you .
2:4:015:0	Talk to him , and put the words in his mouth . I will be with both of you as you speak , and I will instruct you both in what to do .
2:4:016:0	Aaron will be your spokesman to the people . He will be your mouthpiece , and you will stand in the place of God for him , telling him what to say .
2:4:004:1	Moses Returns to Egypt
2:4:017:0	And take your shepherd 's staff with you , and use it to perform the miraculous signs I have shown you . ”
2:4:018:0	So Moses went back home to Jethro , his father-in-law . “ Please let me return to my relatives in Egypt , ” Moses said . “ I do n't even know if they are still alive. ” “ Go in peace , ” Jethro replied .
2:4:019:0	Before Moses left Midian , the Lord said to him , “ Return to Egypt , for all those who wanted to kill you have died . ”
2:4:020:0	So Moses took his wife and sons , put them on a donkey , and headed back to the land of Egypt . In his hand he carried the staff of God .
2:4:021:0	And the Lord told Moses , “ When you arrive back in Egypt , go to Pharaoh and perform all the miracles I have empowered you to do . But I will harden his heart so he will refuse to let the people go .
2:4:022:0	Then you will tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Israel is my firstborn son .
2:4:023:0	I commanded you , “ Let my son go , so he can worship me. ” But since you have refused , I will now kill your firstborn son ! ' ”
2:4:024:0	On the way to Egypt , at a place where Moses and his family had stopped for the night , the Lord confronted him and was about to kill him .
2:4:025:0	But Moses ' wife , Zipporah , took a flint knife and circumcised her son . She touched his feet with the foreskin and said , “ Now you are a bridegroom of blood to me . ”
2:4:026:0	( When she said “ a bridegroom of blood , ” she was referring to the circumcision . ) After that , the Lord left him alone .
2:4:027:0	Now the Lord had said to Aaron , “ Go out into the wilderness to meet Moses. ” So Aaron went and met Moses at the mountain of God , and he embraced him .
2:4:028:0	Moses then told Aaron everything the Lord had commanded him to say . And he told him about the miraculous signs the Lord had commanded him to perform .
2:4:029:0	Then Moses and Aaron returned to Egypt and called all the elders of Israel together .
2:4:030:0	Aaron told them everything the Lord had told Moses , and Moses performed the miraculous signs as they watched .
2:4:031:0	Then the people of Israel were convinced that the Lord had sent Moses and Aaron . When they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery , they bowed down and worshiped .
