2:39:001:1	Clothing for the Priests
2:39:002:1	Making the Ephod
2:39:001:0	The craftsmen made beautiful sacred garments of blue , purple , and scarlet cloth—clothing for Aaron to wear while ministering in the Holy Place , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:002:0	Bezalel made the ephod of finely woven linen and embroidered it with gold and with blue , purple , and scarlet thread .
2:39:003:0	He made gold thread by hammering out thin sheets of gold and cutting it into fine strands . With great skill and care , he worked it into the fine linen with the blue , purple , and scarlet thread .
2:39:004:0	The ephod consisted of two pieces , front and back , joined at the shoulders with two shoulder-pieces .
2:39:005:0	The decorative sash was made of the same materials : finely woven linen embroidered with gold and with blue , purple , and scarlet thread , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:006:0	They mounted the two onyx stones in settings of gold filigree . The stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel , just as a seal is engraved .
2:39:003:1	Making the Chestpiece
2:39:007:0	He fastened these stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod as a reminder that the priest represents the people of Israel . All this was done just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:008:0	Bezalel made the chestpiece with great skill and care . He made it to match the ephod , using finely woven linen embroidered with gold and with blue , purple , and scarlet thread .
2:39:009:0	He made the chestpiece of a single piece of cloth folded to form a pouch nine inches square .
2:39:010:0	They mounted four rows of gemstones on it . The first row contained a red carnelian , a pale-green peridot , and an emerald .
2:39:011:0	The second row contained a turquoise , a blue lapis lazuli , and a white moonstone .
2:39:012:0	The third row contained an orange jacinth , an agate , and a purple amethyst .
2:39:013:0	The fourth row contained a blue-green beryl , an onyx , and a green jasper . All these stones were set in gold filigree .
2:39:014:0	Each stone represented one of the twelve sons of Israel , and the name of that tribe was engraved on it like a seal .
2:39:015:0	To attach the chestpiece to the ephod , they made braided cords of pure gold thread .
2:39:016:0	They also made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings and attached them to the top corners of the chestpiece .
2:39:017:0	They tied the two gold cords to the rings on the chestpiece .
2:39:018:0	They tied the other ends of the cords to the gold settings on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod .
2:39:019:0	Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the inside edges of the chestpiece next to the ephod .
2:39:020:0	Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the front of the ephod , below the shoulder-pieces , just above the knot where the decorative sash was fastened to the ephod .
2:39:004:1	Additional Clothing for the Priests
2:39:021:0	They attached the bottom rings of the chestpiece to the rings on the ephod with blue cords . In this way , the chestpiece was held securely to the ephod above the decorative sash . All this was done just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:022:0	Bezalel made the robe that is worn with the ephod from a single piece of blue woven cloth ,
2:39:023:0	with an opening for Aaron 's head in the middle of it . The opening was reinforced with a woven collar so it would not tear .
2:39:024:0	They made pomegranates of blue , purple , and scarlet yarn , and attached them to the hem of the robe .
2:39:025:0	They also made bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates along the hem of the robe ,
2:39:026:0	with bells and pomegranates alternating all around the hem . This robe was to be worn whenever the priest ministered before the Lord , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:027:0	They made tunics for Aaron and his sons from fine linen cloth .
2:39:028:0	The turban and the special head coverings were made of fine linen , and the undergarments were also made of finely woven linen .
2:39:029:0	The sashes were made of finely woven linen and embroidered with blue , purple , and scarlet thread , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:030:0	Finally , they made the sacred medallion—the badge of holiness—of pure gold . They engraved it like a seal with these words : Holy to the Lord .
2:39:005:1	Moses Inspects the Work
2:39:031:0	They attached the medallion with a blue cord to Aaron 's turban , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:032:0	And so at last the Tabernacle was finished . The Israelites had done everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
2:39:033:0	And they brought the entire Tabernacle to Moses : the sacred tent with all its furnishings , clasps , frames , crossbars , posts , and bases ;
2:39:034:0	the tent coverings of tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather ; the inner curtain to shield the Ark ;
2:39:035:0	the Ark of the Covenant and its carrying poles ; the Ark 's cover—the place of atonement ;
2:39:036:0	the table and all its utensils ; the Bread of the Presence ;
2:39:037:0	the pure gold lampstand with its symmetrical lamp cups , all its accessories , and the olive oil for lighting ;
2:39:038:0	the gold altar ; the anointing oil and fragrant incense ; the curtain for the entrance of the sacred tent ;
2:39:039:0	the bronze altar ; the bronze grating and its carrying poles and utensils ; the washbasin with its stand ;
2:39:040:0	the curtains for the walls of the courtyard ; the posts and their bases ; the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard ; the ropes and tent pegs ; all the furnishings to be used in worship at the Tabernacle ;
2:39:041:0	the beautifully stitched garments for the priests to wear while ministering in the Holy Place—the sacred garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests .
2:39:042:0	So the people of Israel followed all of the Lord 's instructions to Moses .
2:39:043:0	Then Moses inspected all their work . When he found it had been done just as the Lord had commanded him , he blessed them .
