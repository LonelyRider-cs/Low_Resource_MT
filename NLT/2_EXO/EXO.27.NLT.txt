2:27:001:1	Plans for the Altar of Burnt Offering
2:27:001:0	“ Using acacia wood , construct a square altar 71/2 feet wide , 71/2 feet long , and 41/2 feet high .
2:27:002:0	Make horns for each of its four corners so that the horns and altar are all one piece . Overlay the altar with bronze .
2:27:003:0	Make ash buckets , shovels , basins , meat forks , and firepans , all of bronze .
2:27:004:0	Make a bronze grating for it , and attach four bronze rings at its four corners .
2:27:005:0	Install the grating halfway down the side of the altar , under the ledge .
2:27:006:0	For carrying the altar , make poles from acacia wood , and overlay them with bronze .
2:27:007:0	Insert the poles through the rings on the two sides of the altar .
2:27:002:1	Plans for the Courtyard
2:27:008:0	The altar must be hollow , made from planks . Build it just as you were shown on the mountain .
2:27:009:0	“ Then make the courtyard for the Tabernacle , enclosed with curtains made of finely woven linen . On the south side , make the curtains 150 feet long .
2:27:010:0	They will be held up by twenty posts set securely in twenty bronze bases . Hang the curtains with silver hooks and rings .
2:27:011:0	Make the curtains the same on the north side—150 feet of curtains held up by twenty posts set securely in bronze bases . Hang the curtains with silver hooks and rings .
2:27:012:0	The curtains on the west end of the courtyard will be 75 feet long , supported by ten posts set into ten bases .
2:27:013:0	The east end of the courtyard , the front , will also be 75 feet long .
2:27:014:0	The courtyard entrance will be on the east end , flanked by two curtains . The curtain on the right side will be 221/2 feet long , supported by three posts set into three bases .
2:27:015:0	The curtain on the left side will also be 221/2 feet long , supported by three posts set into three bases .
2:27:016:0	“ For the entrance to the courtyard , make a curtain that is 30 feet long . Make it from finely woven linen , and decorate it with beautiful embroidery in blue , purple , and scarlet thread . Support it with four posts , each securely set in its own base .
2:27:017:0	All the posts around the courtyard must have silver rings and hooks and bronze bases .
2:27:018:0	So the entire courtyard will be 150 feet long and 75 feet wide , with curtain walls 71/2 feet high , made from finely woven linen . The bases for the posts will be made of bronze .
2:27:003:1	Light for the Tabernacle
2:27:019:0	“ All the articles used in the rituals of the Tabernacle , including all the tent pegs used to support the Tabernacle and the courtyard curtains , must be made of bronze .
2:27:020:0	“ Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light , to keep the lamps burning continually .
2:27:021:0	The lampstand will stand in the Tabernacle , in front of the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant . Aaron and his sons must keep the lamps burning in the Lord 's presence all night . This is a permanent law for the people of Israel , and it must be observed from generation to generation .
