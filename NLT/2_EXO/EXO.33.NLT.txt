2:33:001:0	The Lord said to Moses , “ Get going , you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt . Go up to the land I swore to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I told them , ‘ I will give this land to your descendants . '
2:33:002:0	And I will send an angel before you to drive out the Canaanites , Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
2:33:003:0	Go up to this land that flows with milk and honey . But I will not travel among you , for you are a stubborn and rebellious people . If I did , I would surely destroy you along the way . ”
2:33:004:0	When the people heard these stern words , they went into mourning and stopped wearing their jewelry and fine clothes .
2:33:005:0	For the Lord had told Moses to tell them , “ You are a stubborn and rebellious people . If I were to travel with you for even a moment , I would destroy you . Remove your jewelry and fine clothes while I decide what to do with you . ”
2:33:006:0	So from the time they left Mount Sinai , the Israelites wore no more jewelry or fine clothes .
2:33:007:0	It was Moses ' practice to take the Tent of Meeting and set it up some distance from the camp . Everyone who wanted to make a request of the Lord would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp .
2:33:008:0	Whenever Moses went out to the Tent of Meeting , all the people would get up and stand in the entrances of their own tents . They would all watch Moses until he disappeared inside .
2:33:009:0	As he went into the tent , the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at its entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses .
2:33:010:0	When the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent , they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents .
2:33:001:1	Moses Sees the
2:33:002:1	Lord
2:33:003:1	's Glory
2:33:011:0	Inside the Tent of Meeting , the Lord would speak to Moses face to face , as one speaks to a friend . Afterward Moses would return to the camp , but the young man who assisted him , Joshua son of Nun , would remain behind in the Tent of Meeting .
2:33:012:0	One day Moses said to the Lord , “ You have been telling me , ‘ Take these people up to the Promised Land . ' But you have n't told me whom you will send with me . You have told me , ‘ I know you by name , and I look favorably on you . '
2:33:013:0	If it is true that you look favorably on me , let me know your ways so I may understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favor . And remember that this nation is your very own people . ”
2:33:014:0	The Lord replied , “ I will personally go with you , Moses , and I will give you rest — everything will be fine for you . ”
2:33:015:0	Then Moses said , “ If you do n't personally go with us , do n't make us leave this place .
2:33:016:0	How will anyone know that you look favorably on me — on me and on your people — if you do n't go with us ? For your presence among us sets your people and me apart from all other people on the earth . ”
2:33:017:0	The Lord replied to Moses , “ I will indeed do what you have asked , for I look favorably on you , and I know you by name . ”
2:33:018:0	Moses responded , “ Then show me your glorious presence . ”
2:33:019:0	The Lord replied , “ I will make all my goodness pass before you , and I will call out my name , Yahweh , before you . For I will show mercy to anyone I choose , and I will show compassion to anyone I choose .
2:33:020:0	But you may not look directly at my face , for no one may see me and live . ”
2:33:021:0	The Lord continued , “ Look , stand near me on this rock .
2:33:022:0	As my glorious presence passes by , I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by .
2:33:023:0	Then I will remove my hand and let you see me from behind . But my face will not be seen . ”
