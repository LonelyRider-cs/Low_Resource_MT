2:36:001:0	“ The Lord has gifted Bezalel , Oholiab , and the other skilled craftsmen with wisdom and ability to perform any task involved in building the sanctuary . Let them construct and furnish the Tabernacle , just as the Lord has commanded . ”
2:36:002:0	So Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and all the others who were specially gifted by the Lord and were eager to get to work .
2:36:003:0	Moses gave them the materials donated by the people of Israel as sacred offerings for the completion of the sanctuary . But the people continued to bring additional gifts each morning .
2:36:004:0	Finally the craftsmen who were working on the sanctuary left their work .
2:36:005:0	They went to Moses and reported , “ The people have given more than enough materials to complete the job the Lord has commanded us to do ! ”
2:36:006:0	So Moses gave the command , and this message was sent throughout the camp : “ Men and women , do n't prepare any more gifts for the sanctuary . We have enough ! ” So the people stopped bringing their sacred offerings .
2:36:001:1	Building the Tabernacle
2:36:007:0	Their contributions were more than enough to complete the whole project .
2:36:008:0	The skilled craftsmen made ten curtains of finely woven linen for the Tabernacle . Then Bezalel decorated the curtains with blue , purple , and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim .
2:36:009:0	All ten curtains were exactly the same size — 42 feet long and 6 feet wide .
2:36:010:0	Five of these curtains were joined together to make one long curtain , and the other five were joined to make a second long curtain .
2:36:011:0	He made fifty loops of blue yarn and put them along the edge of the last curtain in each set .
2:36:012:0	The fifty loops along the edge of one curtain matched the fifty loops along the edge of the other curtain .
2:36:013:0	Then he made fifty gold clasps and fastened the long curtains together with the clasps . In this way , the Tabernacle was made of one continuous piece .
2:36:014:0	He made eleven curtains of goat-hair cloth to serve as a tent covering for the Tabernacle .
2:36:015:0	These eleven curtains were all exactly the same size — 45 feet long and 6 feet wide .
2:36:016:0	Bezalel joined five of these curtains together to make one long curtain , and the other six were joined to make a second long curtain .
2:36:017:0	He made fifty loops for the edge of each large curtain .
2:36:018:0	He also made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the long curtains together . In this way , the tent covering was made of one continuous piece .
2:36:019:0	He completed the tent covering with a layer of tanned ram skins and a layer of fine goatskin leather .
2:36:020:0	For the framework of the Tabernacle , Bezalel constructed frames of acacia wood .
2:36:021:0	Each frame was 15 feet high and 27 inches wide ,
2:36:022:0	with two pegs under each frame . All the frames were identical .
2:36:023:0	He made twenty of these frames to support the curtains on the south side of the Tabernacle .
2:36:024:0	He also made forty silver bases — two bases under each frame , with the pegs fitting securely into the bases .
2:36:025:0	For the north side of the Tabernacle , he made another twenty frames ,
2:36:026:0	with their forty silver bases , two bases under each frame .
2:36:027:0	He made six frames for the rear — the west side of the Tabernacle —
2:36:028:0	along with two additional frames to reinforce the rear corners of the Tabernacle .
2:36:029:0	These corner frames were matched at the bottom and firmly attached at the top with a single ring , forming a single corner unit . Both of these corner units were made the same way .
2:36:030:0	So there were eight frames at the rear of the Tabernacle , set in sixteen silver bases — two bases under each frame .
2:36:031:0	Then he made crossbars of acacia wood to link the frames , five crossbars for the north side of the Tabernacle
2:36:032:0	and five for the south side . He also made five crossbars for the rear of the Tabernacle , which faced west .
2:36:033:0	He made the middle crossbar to attach halfway up the frames ; it ran all the way from one end of the Tabernacle to the other .
2:36:034:0	He overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars . Then he overlaid the crossbars with gold as well .
2:36:035:0	For the inside of the Tabernacle , Bezalel made a special curtain of finely woven linen . He decorated it with blue , purple , and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim .
2:36:036:0	For the curtain , he made four posts of acacia wood and four gold hooks . He overlaid the posts with gold and set them in four silver bases .
2:36:037:0	Then he made another curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent . He made it of finely woven linen and embroidered it with exquisite designs using blue , purple , and scarlet thread .
2:36:038:0	This curtain was hung on gold hooks attached to five posts . The posts with their decorated tops and hooks were overlaid with gold , and the five bases were cast from bronze .
