2:25:001:1	Offerings for the Tabernacle
2:25:001:0	The Lord said to Moses ,
2:25:002:0	“ Tell the people of Israel to bring me their sacred offerings . Accept the contributions from all whose hearts are moved to offer them .
2:25:003:0	Here is a list of sacred offerings you may accept from them : gold , silver , and bronze ;
2:25:004:0	blue , purple , and scarlet thread ; fine linen and goat hair for cloth ;
2:25:005:0	tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather ; acacia wood ;
2:25:006:0	olive oil for the lamps ; spices for the anointing oil and the fragrant incense ;
2:25:007:0	onyx stones , and other gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest 's chestpiece .
2:25:008:0	“ Have the people of Israel build me a holy sanctuary so I can live among them .
2:25:002:1	Plans for the Ark of the Covenant
2:25:009:0	You must build this Tabernacle and its furnishings exactly according to the pattern I will show you .
2:25:010:0	“ Have the people make an Ark of acacia wood — a sacred chest 45 inches long , 27 inches wide , and 27 inches high .
2:25:011:0	Overlay it inside and outside with pure gold , and run a molding of gold all around it .
2:25:012:0	Cast four gold rings and attach them to its four feet , two rings on each side .
2:25:013:0	Make poles from acacia wood , and overlay them with gold .
2:25:014:0	Insert the poles into the rings at the sides of the Ark to carry it .
2:25:015:0	These carrying poles must stay inside the rings ; never remove them .
2:25:016:0	When the Ark is finished , place inside it the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant , which I will give to you .
2:25:017:0	“ Then make the Ark 's cover — the place of atonement — from pure gold . It must be 45 inches long and 27 inches wide .
2:25:018:0	Then make two cherubim from hammered gold , and place them on the two ends of the atonement cover .
2:25:019:0	Mold the cherubim on each end of the atonement cover , making it all of one piece of gold .
2:25:020:0	The cherubim will face each other and look down on the atonement cover . With their wings spread above it , they will protect it .
2:25:021:0	Place inside the Ark the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant , which I will give to you . Then put the atonement cover on top of the Ark .
2:25:003:1	Plans for the Table
2:25:022:0	I will meet with you there and talk to you from above the atonement cover between the gold cherubim that hover over the Ark of the Covenant . From there I will give you my commands for the people of Israel .
2:25:023:0	“ Then make a table of acacia wood , 36 inches long , 18 inches wide , and 27 inches high .
2:25:024:0	Overlay it with pure gold and run a gold molding around the edge .
2:25:025:0	Decorate it with a 3-inch border all around , and run a gold molding along the border .
2:25:026:0	Make four gold rings for the table and attach them at the four corners next to the four legs .
2:25:027:0	Attach the rings near the border to hold the poles that are used to carry the table .
2:25:028:0	Make these poles from acacia wood , and overlay them with gold .
2:25:029:0	Make special containers of pure gold for the table — bowls , ladles , pitchers , and jars — to be used in pouring out liquid offerings .
2:25:004:1	Plans for the Lampstand
2:25:030:0	Place the Bread of the Presence on the table to remain before me at all times .
2:25:031:0	“ Make a lampstand of pure , hammered gold . Make the entire lampstand and its decorations of one piece — the base , center stem , lamp cups , buds , and petals .
2:25:032:0	Make it with six branches going out from the center stem , three on each side .
2:25:033:0	Each of the six branches will have three lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms , complete with buds and petals .
2:25:034:0	Craft the center stem of the lampstand with four lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms , complete with buds and petals .
2:25:035:0	There will also be an almond bud beneath each pair of branches where the six branches extend from the center stem .
2:25:036:0	The almond buds and branches must all be of one piece with the center stem , and they must be hammered from pure gold .
2:25:037:0	Then make the seven lamps for the lampstand , and set them so they reflect their light forward .
2:25:038:0	The lamp snuffers and trays must also be made of pure gold .
2:25:039:0	You will need 75 pounds of pure gold for the lampstand and its accessories .
2:25:040:0	“ Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain .
