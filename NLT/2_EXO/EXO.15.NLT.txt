2:15:001:1	A Song of Deliverance
2:15:001:0	Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the Lord : “ I will sing to the Lord , for he has triumphed gloriously ; he has hurled both horse and riderinto the sea .
2:15:002:0	The Lord is my strength and my song ; he has given me victory.This is my God , and I will praise him—my father 's God , and I will exalt him !
2:15:003:0	The Lord is a warrior ; Yahweh is his name !
2:15:004:0	Pharaoh 's chariots and armyhe has hurled into the sea.The finest of Pharaoh 's officersare drowned in the Red Sea .
2:15:005:0	The deep waters gushed over them ; they sank to the bottom like a stone .
2:15:006:0	“ Your right hand , O Lord , is glorious in power.Your right hand , O Lord , smashes the enemy .
2:15:007:0	In the greatness of your majesty , you overthrow those who rise against you.You unleash your blazing fury ; it consumes them like straw .
2:15:008:0	At the blast of your breath , the waters piled up ! The surging waters stood straight like a wall ; in the heart of the sea the deep waters became hard .
2:15:009:0	“ The enemy boasted , ‘ I will chase themand catch up with them.I will plunder themand consume them.I will flash my sword ; my powerful hand will destroy them . '
2:15:010:0	But you blew with your breath , and the sea covered them.They sank like leadin the mighty waters .
2:15:011:0	“ Who is like you among the gods , O Lord—glorious in holiness , awesome in splendor , performing great wonders ?
2:15:012:0	You raised your right hand , and the earth swallowed our enemies .
2:15:013:0	“ With your unfailing love you leadthe people you have redeemed.In your might , you guide themto your sacred home .
2:15:014:0	The peoples hear and tremble ; anguish grips those who live in Philistia .
2:15:015:0	The leaders of Edom are terrified ; the nobles of Moab tremble.All who live in Canaan melt away ;
2:15:016:0	terror and dread fall upon them.The power of your armmakes them lifeless as stoneuntil your people pass by , O Lord , until the people you purchased pass by .
2:15:017:0	You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain—the place , O Lord , reserved for your own dwelling , the sanctuary , O Lord , that your hands have established .
2:15:018:0	The Lord will reign forever and ever ! ”
2:15:019:0	When Pharaoh 's horses , chariots , and charioteers rushed into the sea , the Lord brought the water crashing down on them . But the people of Israel had walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground !
2:15:020:0	Then Miriam the prophet , Aaron 's sister , took a tambourine and led all the women as they played their tambourines and danced .
2:15:002:1	Bitter Water at Marah
2:15:021:0	And Miriam sang this song : “ Sing to the Lord , for he has triumphed gloriously ; he has hurled both horse and riderinto the sea . ”
2:15:022:0	Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea , and they moved out into the desert of Shur . They traveled in this desert for three days without finding any water .
2:15:023:0	When they came to the oasis of Marah , the water was too bitter to drink . So they called the place Marah ( which means “ bitter ” ) .
2:15:024:0	Then the people complained and turned against Moses . “ What are we going to drink ? ” they demanded .
2:15:025:0	So Moses cried out to the Lord for help , and the Lord showed him a piece of wood . Moses threw it into the water , and this made the water good to drink.It was there at Marah that the Lord set before them the following decree as a standard to test their faithfulness to him .
2:15:026:0	He said , “ If you will listen carefully to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in his sight , obeying his commands and keeping all his decrees , then I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I sent on the Egyptians ; for I am the Lord who heals you . ”
2:15:027:0	After leaving Marah , the Israelites traveled on to the oasis of Elim , where they found twelve springs and seventy palm trees . They camped there beside the water .
