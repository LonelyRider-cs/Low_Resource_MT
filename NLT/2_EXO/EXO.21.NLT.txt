2:21:001:1	Fair Treatment of Slaves
2:21:001:0	“ These are the regulations you must present to Israel .
2:21:002:0	“ If you buy a Hebrew slave , he may serve for no more than six years . Set him free in the seventh year , and he will owe you nothing for his freedom .
2:21:003:0	If he was single when he became your slave , he shall leave single . But if he was married before he became a slave , then his wife must be freed with him .
2:21:004:0	“ If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave and they had sons or daughters , then only the man will be free in the seventh year , but his wife and children will still belong to his master .
2:21:005:0	But the slave may declare , ‘ I love my master , my wife , and my children . I do n't want to go free . '
2:21:006:0	If he does this , his master must present him before God . Then his master must take him to the door or doorpost and publicly pierce his ear with an awl . After that , the slave will serve his master for life .
2:21:007:0	“ When a man sells his daughter as a slave , she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are .
2:21:008:0	If she does not satisfy her owner , he must allow her to be bought back again . But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners , since he is the one who broke the contract with her .
2:21:009:0	But if the slave 's owner arranges for her to marry his son , he may no longer treat her as a slave but as a daughter .
2:21:010:0	“ If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself , he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food , clothing , and sexual intimacy .
2:21:002:1	Cases of Personal Injury
2:21:011:0	If he fails in any of these three obligations , she may leave as a free woman without making any payment .
2:21:012:0	“ Anyone who assaults and kills another person must be put to death .
2:21:013:0	But if it was simply an accident permitted by God , I will appoint a place of refuge where the slayer can run for safety .
2:21:014:0	However , if someone deliberately kills another person , then the slayer must be dragged even from my altar and be put to death .
2:21:015:0	“ Anyone who strikes father or mother must be put to death .
2:21:016:0	“ Kidnappers must be put to death , whether they are caught in possession of their victims or have already sold them as slaves .
2:21:017:0	“ Anyone who dishonors father or mother must be put to death .
2:21:018:0	“ Now suppose two men quarrel , and one hits the other with a stone or fist , and the injured person does not die but is confined to bed .
2:21:019:0	If he is later able to walk outside again , even with a crutch , the assailant will not be punished but must compensate his victim for lost wages and provide for his full recovery .
2:21:020:0	“ If a man beats his male or female slave with a club and the slave dies as a result , the owner must be punished .
2:21:021:0	But if the slave recovers within a day or two , then the owner shall not be punished , since the slave is his property .
2:21:022:0	“ Now suppose two men are fighting , and in the process they accidentally strike a pregnant woman so she gives birth prematurely . If no further injury results , the man who struck the woman must pay the amount of compensation the woman 's husband demands and the judges approve .
2:21:023:0	But if there is further injury , the punishment must match the injury : a life for a life ,
2:21:024:0	an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a hand for a hand , a foot for a foot ,
2:21:025:0	a burn for a burn , a wound for a wound , a bruise for a bruise .
2:21:026:0	“ If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and the eye is blinded , he must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye .
2:21:027:0	And if a man knocks out the tooth of his male or female slave , he must let the slave go free to compensate for the tooth .
2:21:028:0	“ If an ox gores a man or woman to death , the ox must be stoned , and its flesh may not be eaten . In such a case , however , the owner will not be held liable .
2:21:029:0	But suppose the ox had a reputation for goring , and the owner had been informed but failed to keep it under control . If the ox then kills someone , it must be stoned , and the owner must also be put to death .
2:21:030:0	However , the dead person 's relatives may accept payment to compensate for the loss of life . The owner of the ox may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded .
2:21:031:0	“ The same regulation applies if the ox gores a boy or a girl .
2:21:032:0	But if the ox gores a slave , either male or female , the animal 's owner must pay the slave 's owner thirty silver coins , and the ox must be stoned .
2:21:033:0	“ Suppose someone digs or uncovers a pit and fails to cover it , and then an ox or a donkey falls into it .
2:21:034:0	The owner of the pit must pay full compensation to the owner of the animal , but then he gets to keep the dead animal .
2:21:035:0	“ If someone 's ox injures a neighbor 's ox and the injured ox dies , then the two owners must sell the live ox and divide the price equally between them . They must also divide the dead animal .
2:21:036:0	But if the ox had a reputation for goring , yet its owner failed to keep it under control , he must pay full compensation — a live ox for the dead one — but he may keep the dead ox .
