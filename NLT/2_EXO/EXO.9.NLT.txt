2:9:001:1	A Plague against Livestock
2:9:001:0	“ Go back to Pharaoh , ” the Lord commanded Moses . “ Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : Let my people go , so they can worship me .
2:9:002:0	If you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go ,
2:9:003:0	the hand of the Lord will strike all your livestock — your horses , donkeys , camels , cattle , sheep , and goats — with a deadly plague .
2:9:004:0	But the Lord will again make a distinction between the livestock of the Israelites and that of the Egyptians . Not a single one of Israel 's animals will die !
2:9:005:0	The Lord has already set the time for the plague to begin . He has declared that he will strike the land tomorrow . ' ”
2:9:006:0	And the Lord did just as he had said . The next morning all the livestock of the Egyptians died , but the Israelites did n't lose a single animal .
2:9:002:1	A Plague of Festering Boils
2:9:007:0	Pharaoh sent his officials to investigate , and they discovered that the Israelites had not lost a single animal ! But even so , Pharaoh 's heart remained stubborn , and he still refused to let the people go .
2:9:008:0	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Take handfuls of soot from a brick kiln , and have Moses toss it into the air while Pharaoh watches .
2:9:009:0	The ashes will spread like fine dust over the whole land of Egypt , causing festering boils to break out on people and animals throughout the land . ”
2:9:010:0	So they took soot from a brick kiln and went and stood before Pharaoh . As Pharaoh watched , Moses threw the soot into the air , and boils broke out on people and animals alike .
2:9:011:0	Even the magicians were unable to stand before Moses , because the boils had broken out on them and all the Egyptians .
2:9:003:1	A Plague of Hail
2:9:012:0	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh 's heart , and just as the Lord had predicted to Moses , Pharaoh refused to listen .
2:9:013:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh . Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : Let my people go , so they can worship me .
2:9:014:0	If you do n't , I will send more plagues on you and your officials and your people . Then you will know that there is no one like me in all the earth .
2:9:015:0	By now I could have lifted my hand and struck you and your people with a plague to wipe you off the face of the earth .
2:9:016:0	But I have spared you for a purpose — to show you my power and to spread my fame throughout the earth .
2:9:017:0	But you still lord it over my people and refuse to let them go .
2:9:018:0	So tomorrow at this time I will send a hailstorm more devastating than any in all the history of Egypt .
2:9:019:0	Quick ! Order your livestock and servants to come in from the fields to find shelter . Any person or animal left outside will die when the hail falls . ' ”
2:9:020:0	Some of Pharaoh 's officials were afraid because of what the Lord had said . They quickly brought their servants and livestock in from the fields .
2:9:021:0	But those who paid no attention to the word of the Lord left theirs out in the open .
2:9:022:0	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Lift your hand toward the sky so hail may fall on the people , the livestock , and all the plants throughout the land of Egypt . ”
2:9:023:0	So Moses lifted his staff toward the sky , and the Lord sent thunder and hail , and lightning flashed toward the earth . The Lord sent a tremendous hailstorm against all the land of Egypt .
2:9:024:0	Never in all the history of Egypt had there been a storm like that , with such devastating hail and continuous lightning .
2:9:025:0	It left all of Egypt in ruins . The hail struck down everything in the open field — people , animals , and plants alike . Even the trees were destroyed .
2:9:026:0	The only place without hail was the region of Goshen , where the people of Israel lived .
2:9:027:0	Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron . “ This time I have sinned , ” he confessed . “ The Lord is the righteous one , and my people and I are wrong .
2:9:028:0	Please beg the Lord to end this terrifying thunder and hail . We 've had enough . I will let you go ; you do n't need to stay any longer . ”
2:9:029:0	“ All right , ” Moses replied . “ As soon as I leave the city , I will lift my hands and pray to the Lord . Then the thunder and hail will stop , and you will know that the earth belongs to the Lord .
2:9:030:0	But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the Lord God . ”
2:9:031:0	( All the flax and barley were ruined by the hail , because the barley had formed heads and the flax was budding .
2:9:032:0	But the wheat and the emmer wheat were spared , because they had not yet sprouted from the ground . )
2:9:033:0	So Moses left Pharaoh 's court and went out of the city . When he lifted his hands to the Lord , the thunder and hail stopped , and the downpour ceased .
2:9:034:0	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain , hail , and thunder had stopped , he and his officials sinned again , and Pharaoh again became stubborn .
2:9:035:0	Because his heart was hard , Pharaoh refused to let the people leave , just as the Lord had predicted through Moses .
