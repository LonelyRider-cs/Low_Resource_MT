18:34:001:0	Furthermore Elihu answered and said ,
18:34:002:0	Hear my words , O ye wise men ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge .
18:34:003:0	For the ear trieth words , as the mouth tasteth meat .
18:34:004:0	Let us choose to us judgment : let us know among ourselves what is good .
18:34:005:0	For Job hath said , I am righteous : and God hath taken away my judgment .
18:34:006:0	Should I lie against my right ? my wound is incurable without transgression .
18:34:007:0	What man is like Job , who drinketh up scorning like water ?
18:34:008:0	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity , and walketh with wicked men .
18:34:009:0	For he hath said , It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God .
18:34:010:0	Therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness ; and from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
18:34:011:0	For the work of a man shall he render unto him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
18:34:012:0	Yea , surely God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty pervert judgment .
18:34:013:0	Who hath given him a charge over the earth ? or who hath disposed the whole world ?
18:34:014:0	If he set his heart upon man , if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath ;
18:34:015:0	All flesh shall perish together , and man shall turn again unto dust .
18:34:016:0	If now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice of my words .
18:34:017:0	Shall even he that hateth right govern ? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just ?
18:34:018:0	Is it fit to say to a king , Thou art wicked ? and to princes , Ye are ungodly ?
18:34:019:0	How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor ? for they all are the work of his hands .
18:34:020:0	In a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be taken away without hand .
18:34:021:0	For his eyes are upon the ways of man , and he seeth all his goings .
18:34:022:0	There is no darkness , nor shadow of death , where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
18:34:023:0	For he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with God .
18:34:024:0	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number , and set others in their stead .
18:34:025:0	Therefore he knoweth their works , and he overturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
18:34:026:0	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ;
18:34:027:0	Because they turned back from him , and would not consider any of his ways :
18:34:028:0	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
18:34:029:0	When he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
18:34:030:0	That the hypocrite reign not , lest the people be ensnared .
18:34:031:0	Surely it is meet to be said unto God , I have borne chastisement , I will not offend any more :
18:34:032:0	That which I see not teach thou me : if I have done iniquity , I will do no more .
18:34:033:0	Should it be according to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest .
18:34:034:0	Let men of understanding tell me , and let a wise man hearken unto me .
18:34:035:0	Job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without wisdom .
18:34:036:0	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men .
18:34:037:0	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin , he clappeth his hands among us , and multiplieth his words against God .
