18:32:001:0	So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
18:32:002:0	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
18:32:003:0	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job .
18:32:004:0	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken , because they were elder than he .
18:32:005:0	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , then his wrath was kindled .
18:32:006:0	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am young , and ye are very old ; wherefore I was afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
18:32:007:0	I said , Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom .
18:32:008:0	But there is a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding .
18:32:009:0	Great men are not always wise : neither do the aged understand judgment .
18:32:010:0	Therefore I said , Hearken to me ; I also will shew mine opinion .
18:32:011:0	Behold , I waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasons , whilst ye searched out what to say .
18:32:012:0	Yea , I attended unto you , and , behold , there was none of you that convinced Job , or that answered his words :
18:32:013:0	Lest ye should say , We have found out wisdom : God thrusteth him down , not man .
18:32:014:0	Now he hath not directed his words against me : neither will I answer him with your speeches .
18:32:015:0	They were amazed , they answered no more : they left off speaking .
18:32:016:0	When I had waited , ( for they spake not , but stood still , and answered no more ; )
18:32:017:0	I said , I will answer also my part , I also will shew mine opinion .
18:32:018:0	For I am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me .
18:32:019:0	Behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; it is ready to burst like new bottles .
18:32:020:0	I will speak , that I may be refreshed : I will open my lips and answer .
18:32:021:0	Let me not , I pray you , accept any man's person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
18:32:022:0	For I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
