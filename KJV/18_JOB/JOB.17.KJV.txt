18:17:001:0	My breath is corrupt , my days are extinct , the graves are ready for me .
18:17:002:0	Are there not mockers with me ? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation ?
18:17:003:0	Lay down now , put me in a surety with thee ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
18:17:004:0	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding : therefore shalt thou not exalt them .
18:17:005:0	He that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
18:17:006:0	He hath made me also a byword of the people ; and aforetime I was as a tabret .
18:17:007:0	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
18:17:008:0	Upright men shall be astonished at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite .
18:17:009:0	The righteous also shall hold on his way , and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger .
18:17:010:0	But as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for I cannot find one wise man among you .
18:17:011:0	My days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the thoughts of my heart .
18:17:012:0	They change the night into day : the light is short because of darkness .
18:17:013:0	If I wait , the grave is mine house : I have made my bed in the darkness .
18:17:014:0	I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou art my mother , and my sister .
18:17:015:0	And where is now my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
18:17:016:0	They shall go down to the bars of the pit , when our rest together is in the dust .
