18:31:001:0	I made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I think upon a maid ?
18:31:002:0	For what portion of God is there from above ? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high ?
18:31:003:0	Is not destruction to the wicked ? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity ?
18:31:004:0	Doth not he see my ways , and count all my steps ?
18:31:005:0	If I have walked with vanity , or if my foot hath hasted to deceit ;
18:31:006:0	Let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know mine integrity .
18:31:007:0	If my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ;
18:31:008:0	Then let me sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out .
18:31:009:0	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door ;
18:31:010:0	Then let my wife grind unto another , and let others bow down upon her .
18:31:011:0	For this is an heinous crime ; yea , it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges .
18:31:012:0	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would root out all mine increase .
18:31:013:0	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant , when they contended with me ;
18:31:014:0	What then shall I do when God riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ?
18:31:015:0	Did not he that made me in the womb make him ? and did not one fashion us in the womb ?
18:31:016:0	If I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ;
18:31:017:0	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof ;
18:31:018:0	( For from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother's womb ; )
18:31:019:0	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without covering ;
18:31:020:0	If his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ;
18:31:021:0	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , when I saw my help in the gate :
18:31:022:0	Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
18:31:023:0	For destruction from God was a terror to me , and by reason of his highness I could not endure .
18:31:024:0	If I have made gold my hope , or have said to the fine gold , Thou art my confidence ;
18:31:025:0	If I rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much ;
18:31:026:0	If I beheld the sun when it shined , or the moon walking in brightness ;
18:31:027:0	And my heart hath been secretly enticed , or my mouth hath kissed my hand :
18:31:028:0	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge : for I should have denied the God that is above .
18:31:029:0	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him :
18:31:030:0	Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul .
18:31:031:0	If the men of my tabernacle said not , Oh that we had of his flesh ! we cannot be satisfied .
18:31:032:0	The stranger did not lodge in the street : but I opened my doors to the traveller .
18:31:033:0	If I covered my transgressions as Adam , by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom :
18:31:034:0	Did I fear a great multitude , or did the contempt of families terrify me , that I kept silence , and went not out of the door ?
18:31:035:0	Oh that one would hear me ! behold , my desire is , that the Almighty would answer me , and that mine adversary had written a book .
18:31:036:0	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder , and bind it as a crown to me .
18:31:037:0	I would declare unto him the number of my steps ; as a prince would I go near unto him .
18:31:038:0	If my land cry against me , or that the furrows likewise thereof complain ;
18:31:039:0	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life :
18:31:040:0	Let thistles grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead of barley . The words of Job are ended .
