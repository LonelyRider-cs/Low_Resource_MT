18:24:001:0	Why , seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty , do they that know him not see his days ?
18:24:002:0	Some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
18:24:003:0	They drive away the ass of the fatherless , they take the widow 's ox for a pledge .
18:24:004:0	They turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
18:24:005:0	Behold , as wild asses in the desert , go they forth to their work ; rising betimes for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children .
18:24:006:0	They reap every one his corn in the field : and they gather the vintage of the wicked .
18:24:007:0	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no covering in the cold .
18:24:008:0	They are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
18:24:009:0	They pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor .
18:24:010:0	They cause him to go naked without clothing , and they take away the sheaf from the hungry ;
18:24:011:0	Which make oil within their walls , and tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst .
18:24:012:0	Men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out : yet God layeth not folly to them .
18:24:013:0	They are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
18:24:014:0	The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
18:24:015:0	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , saying , No eye shall see me : and disguiseth his face .
18:24:016:0	In the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
18:24:017:0	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
18:24:018:0	He is swift as the waters ; their portion is cursed in the earth : he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards .
18:24:019:0	Drought and heat consume the snow waters : so doth the grave those which have sinned .
18:24:020:0	The womb shall forget him ; the worm shall feed sweetly on him ; he shall be no more remembered ; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree .
18:24:021:0	He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not : and doeth not good to the widow .
18:24:022:0	He draweth also the mighty with his power : he riseth up , and no man is sure of life .
18:24:023:0	Though it be given him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet his eyes are upon their ways .
18:24:024:0	They are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
18:24:025:0	And if it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my speech nothing worth ?
