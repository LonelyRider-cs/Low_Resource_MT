18:5:001:0	Call now , if there be any that will answer thee ; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn ?
18:5:002:0	For wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one .
18:5:003:0	I have seen the foolish taking root : but suddenly I cursed his habitation .
18:5:004:0	His children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
18:5:005:0	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance .
18:5:006:0	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ;
18:5:007:0	Yet man is born unto trouble , as the sparks fly upward .
18:5:008:0	I would seek unto God , and unto God would I commit my cause :
18:5:009:0	Which doeth great things and unsearchable ; marvellous things without number :
18:5:010:0	Who giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth waters upon the fields :
18:5:011:0	To set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety .
18:5:012:0	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty , so that their hands can not perform their enterprise .
18:5:013:0	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness : and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong .
18:5:014:0	They meet with darkness in the daytime , and grope in the noonday as in the night .
18:5:015:0	But he saveth the poor from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
18:5:016:0	So the poor hath hope , and iniquity stoppeth her mouth .
18:5:017:0	Behold , happy is the man whom God correcteth : therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty :
18:5:018:0	For he maketh sore , and bindeth up : he woundeth , and his hands make whole .
18:5:019:0	He shall deliver thee in six troubles : yea , in seven there shall no evil touch thee .
18:5:020:0	In famine he shall redeem thee from death : and in war from the power of the sword .
18:5:021:0	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
18:5:022:0	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth .
18:5:023:0	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
18:5:024:0	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin .
18:5:025:0	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
18:5:026:0	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age , like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season .
18:5:027:0	Lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
