18:19:001:0	Then Job answered and said ,
18:19:002:0	How long will ye vex my soul , and break me in pieces with words ?
18:19:003:0	These ten times have ye reproached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
18:19:004:0	And be it indeed that I have erred , mine error remaineth with myself .
18:19:005:0	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me , and plead against me my reproach :
18:19:006:0	Know now that God hath overthrown me , and hath compassed me with his net .
18:19:007:0	Behold , I cry out of wrong , but I am not heard : I cry aloud , but there is no judgment .
18:19:008:0	He hath fenced up my way that I can not pass , and he hath set darkness in my paths .
18:19:009:0	He hath stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
18:19:010:0	He hath destroyed me on every side , and I am gone : and mine hope hath he removed like a tree .
18:19:011:0	He hath also kindled his wrath against me , and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies .
18:19:012:0	His troops come together , and raise up their way against me , and encamp round about my tabernacle .
18:19:013:0	He hath put my brethren far from me , and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me .
18:19:014:0	My kinsfolk have failed , and my familiar friends have forgotten me .
18:19:015:0	They that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight .
18:19:016:0	I called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; I entreated him with my mouth .
18:19:017:0	My breath is strange to my wife , though I entreated for the children 's sake of mine own body .
18:19:018:0	Yea , young children despised me ; I arose , and they spake against me .
18:19:019:0	All my inward friends abhorred me : and they whom I loved are turned against me .
18:19:020:0	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth .
18:19:021:0	Have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
18:19:022:0	Why do ye persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
18:19:023:0	Oh that my words were now written ! oh that they were printed in a book !
18:19:024:0	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever !
18:19:025:0	For I know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth :
18:19:026:0	And though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God :
18:19:027:0	Whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another ; though my reins be consumed within me .
18:19:028:0	But ye should say , Why persecute we him , seeing the root of the matter is found in me ?
18:19:029:0	Be ye afraid of the sword : for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword , that ye may know there is a judgment .
