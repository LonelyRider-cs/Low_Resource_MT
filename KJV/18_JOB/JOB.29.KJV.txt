18:29:001:0	Moreover Job continued his parable , and said ,
18:29:002:0	Oh that I were as in months past , as in the days when God preserved me ;
18:29:003:0	When his candle shined upon my head , and when by his light I walked through darkness ;
18:29:004:0	As I was in the days of my youth , when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle ;
18:29:005:0	When the Almighty was yet with me , when my children were about me ;
18:29:006:0	When I washed my steps with butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ;
18:29:007:0	When I went out to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street !
18:29:008:0	The young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and stood up .
18:29:009:0	The princes refrained talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
18:29:010:0	The nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth .
18:29:011:0	When the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me :
18:29:012:0	Because I delivered the poor that cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him .
18:29:013:0	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me : and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy .
18:29:014:0	I put on righteousness , and it clothed me : my judgment was as a robe and a diadem .
18:29:015:0	I was eyes to the blind , and feet was I to the lame .
18:29:016:0	I was a father to the poor : and the cause which I knew not I searched out .
18:29:017:0	And I brake the jaws of the wicked , and plucked the spoil out of his teeth .
18:29:018:0	Then I said , I shall die in my nest , and I shall multiply my days as the sand .
18:29:019:0	My root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
18:29:020:0	My glory was fresh in me , and my bow was renewed in my hand .
18:29:021:0	Unto me men gave ear , and waited , and kept silence at my counsel .
18:29:022:0	After my words they spake not again ; and my speech dropped upon them .
18:29:023:0	And they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
18:29:024:0	If I laughed on them , they believed it not ; and the light of my countenance they cast not down .
18:29:025:0	I chose out their way , and sat chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourners .
