18:15:001:0	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite , and said ,
18:15:002:0	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge , and fill his belly with the east wind ?
18:15:003:0	Should he reason with unprofitable talk ? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ?
18:15:004:0	Yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest prayer before God .
18:15:005:0	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty .
18:15:006:0	Thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I : yea , thine own lips testify against thee .
18:15:007:0	Art thou the first man that was born ? or wast thou made before the hills ?
18:15:008:0	Hast thou heard the secret of God ? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself ?
18:15:009:0	What knowest thou , that we know not ? what understandest thou , which is not in us ?
18:15:010:0	With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men , much elder than thy father .
18:15:011:0	Are the consolations of God small with thee ? is there any secret thing with thee ?
18:15:012:0	Why doth thine heart carry thee away ? and what do thy eyes wink at ,
18:15:013:0	That thou turnest thy spirit against God , and lettest such words go out of thy mouth ?
18:15:014:0	What is man , that he should be clean ? and he which is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
18:15:015:0	Behold , he putteth no trust in his saints ; yea , the heavens are not clean in his sight .
18:15:016:0	How much more abominable and filthy is man , which drinketh iniquity like water ?
18:15:017:0	I will shew thee , hear me ; and that which I have seen I will declare ;
18:15:018:0	Which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hid it :
18:15:019:0	Unto whom alone the earth was given , and no stranger passed among them .
18:15:020:0	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
18:15:021:0	A dreadful sound is in his ears : in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him .
18:15:022:0	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is waited for of the sword .
18:15:023:0	He wandereth abroad for bread , saying , Where is it ? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
18:15:024:0	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
18:15:025:0	For he stretcheth out his hand against God , and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty .
18:15:026:0	He runneth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of his bucklers :
18:15:027:0	Because he covereth his face with his fatness , and maketh collops of fat on his flanks .
18:15:028:0	And he dwelleth in desolate cities , and in houses which no man inhabiteth , which are ready to become heaps .
18:15:029:0	He shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth .
18:15:030:0	He shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away .
18:15:031:0	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity : for vanity shall be his recompence .
18:15:032:0	It shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not be green .
18:15:033:0	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
18:15:034:0	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate , and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery .
18:15:035:0	They conceive mischief , and bring forth vanity , and their belly prepareth deceit .
