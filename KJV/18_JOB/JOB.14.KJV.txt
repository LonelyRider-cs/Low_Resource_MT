18:14:001:0	Man that is born of a woman is of few days , and full of trouble .
18:14:002:0	He cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
18:14:003:0	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one , and bringest me into judgment with thee ?
18:14:004:0	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one .
18:14:005:0	Seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass ;
18:14:006:0	Turn from him , that he may rest , till he shall accomplish , as an hireling , his day .
18:14:007:0	For there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
18:14:008:0	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock thereof die in the ground ;
18:14:009:0	Yet through the scent of water it will bud , and bring forth boughs like a plant .
18:14:010:0	But man dieth , and wasteth away : yea , man giveth up the ghost , and where is he ?
18:14:011:0	As the waters fail from the sea , and the flood decayeth and drieth up :
18:14:012:0	So man lieth down , and riseth not : till the heavens be no more , they shall not awake , nor be raised out of their sleep .
18:14:013:0	O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
18:14:014:0	If a man die , shall he live again ? all the days of my appointed time will I wait , till my change come .
18:14:015:0	Thou shalt call , and I will answer thee : thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands .
18:14:016:0	For now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
18:14:017:0	My transgression is sealed up in a bag , and thou sewest up mine iniquity .
18:14:018:0	And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought , and the rock is removed out of his place .
18:14:019:0	The waters wear the stones : thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of man .
18:14:020:0	Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth : thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away .
18:14:021:0	His sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them .
18:14:022:0	But his flesh upon him shall have pain , and his soul within him shall mourn .
