18:21:001:0	But Job answered and said ,
18:21:002:0	Hear diligently my speech , and let this be your consolations .
18:21:003:0	Suffer me that I may speak ; and after that I have spoken , mock on .
18:21:004:0	As for me , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
18:21:005:0	Mark me , and be astonished , and lay your hand upon your mouth .
18:21:006:0	Even when I remember I am afraid , and trembling taketh hold on my flesh .
18:21:007:0	Wherefore do the wicked live , become old , yea , are mighty in power ?
18:21:008:0	Their seed is established in their sight with them , and their offspring before their eyes .
18:21:009:0	Their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of God upon them .
18:21:010:0	Their bull gendereth , and faileth not ; their cow calveth , and casteth not her calf .
18:21:011:0	They send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance .
18:21:012:0	They take the timbrel and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the organ .
18:21:013:0	They spend their days in wealth , and in a moment go down to the grave .
18:21:014:0	Therefore they say unto God , Depart from us ; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways .
18:21:015:0	What is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? and what profit should we have , if we pray unto him ?
18:21:016:0	Lo , their good is not in their hand : the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
18:21:017:0	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out ! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them ! God distributeth sorrows in his anger .
18:21:018:0	They are as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm carrieth away .
18:21:019:0	God layeth up his iniquity for his children : he rewardeth him , and he shall know it .
18:21:020:0	His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
18:21:021:0	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
18:21:022:0	Shall any teach God knowledge ? seeing he judgeth those that are high .
18:21:023:0	One dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet .
18:21:024:0	His breasts are full of milk , and his bones are moistened with marrow .
18:21:025:0	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul , and never eateth with pleasure .
18:21:026:0	They shall lie down alike in the dust , and the worms shall cover them .
18:21:027:0	Behold , I know your thoughts , and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me .
18:21:028:0	For ye say , Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked ?
18:21:029:0	Have ye not asked them that go by the way ? and do ye not know their tokens ,
18:21:030:0	That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath .
18:21:031:0	Who shall declare his way to his face ? and who shall repay him what he hath done ?
18:21:032:0	Yet shall he be brought to the grave , and shall remain in the tomb .
18:21:033:0	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
18:21:034:0	How then comfort ye me in vain , seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood ?
