18:3:001:0	After this opened Job his mouth , and cursed his day .
18:3:002:0	And Job spake , and said ,
18:3:003:0	Let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived .
18:3:004:0	Let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
18:3:005:0	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
18:3:006:0	As for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
18:3:007:0	Lo , let that night be solitary , let no joyful voice come therein .
18:3:008:0	Let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to raise up their mourning .
18:3:009:0	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day :
18:3:010:0	Because it shut not up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
18:3:011:0	Why died I not from the womb ? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly ?
18:3:012:0	Why did the knees prevent me ? or why the breasts that I should suck ?
18:3:013:0	For now should I have lain still and been quiet , I should have slept : then had I been at rest ,
18:3:014:0	With kings and counsellors of the earth , which built desolate places for themselves ;
18:3:015:0	Or with princes that had gold , who filled their houses with silver :
18:3:016:0	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been ; as infants which never saw light .
18:3:017:0	There the wicked cease from troubling ; and there the weary be at rest .
18:3:018:0	There the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
18:3:019:0	The small and great are there ; and the servant is free from his master .
18:3:020:0	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ;
18:3:021:0	Which long for death , but it cometh not ; and dig for it more than for hid treasures ;
18:3:022:0	Which rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
18:3:023:0	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid , and whom God hath hedged in ?
18:3:024:0	For my sighing cometh before I eat , and my roarings are poured out like the waters .
18:3:025:0	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me .
18:3:026:0	I was not in safety , neither had I rest , neither was I quiet ; yet trouble came .
