18:4:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said ,
18:4:002:0	If we assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
18:4:003:0	Behold , thou hast instructed many , and thou hast strengthened the weak hands .
18:4:004:0	Thy words have upholden him that was falling , and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees .
18:4:005:0	But now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
18:4:006:0	Is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ?
18:4:007:0	Remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ?
18:4:008:0	Even as I have seen , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickedness , reap the same .
18:4:009:0	By the blast of God they perish , and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed .
18:4:010:0	The roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
18:4:011:0	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad .
18:4:012:0	Now a thing was secretly brought to me , and mine ear received a little thereof .
18:4:013:0	In thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falleth on men ,
18:4:014:0	Fear came upon me , and trembling , which made all my bones to shake .
18:4:015:0	Then a spirit passed before my face ; the hair of my flesh stood up :
18:4:016:0	It stood still , but I could not discern the form thereof : an image was before mine eyes , there was silence , and I heard a voice , saying ,
18:4:017:0	Shall mortal man be more just than God ? shall a man be more pure than his maker ?
18:4:018:0	Behold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his angels he charged with folly :
18:4:019:0	How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
18:4:020:0	They are destroyed from morning to evening : they perish for ever without any regarding it .
18:4:021:0	Doth not their excellency which is in them go away ? they die , even without wisdom .
