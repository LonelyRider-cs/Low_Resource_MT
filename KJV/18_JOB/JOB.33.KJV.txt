18:33:001:0	Wherefore , Job , I pray thee , hear my speeches , and hearken to all my words .
18:33:002:0	Behold , now I have opened my mouth , my tongue hath spoken in my mouth .
18:33:003:0	My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly .
18:33:004:0	The Spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life .
18:33:005:0	If thou canst answer me , set thy words in order before me , stand up .
18:33:006:0	Behold , I am according to thy wish in God's stead : I also am formed out of the clay .
18:33:007:0	Behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
18:33:008:0	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of thy words , saying ,
18:33:009:0	I am clean without transgression , I am innocent ; neither is there iniquity in me .
18:33:010:0	Behold , he findeth occasions against me , he counteth me for his enemy ,
18:33:011:0	He putteth my feet in the stocks , he marketh all my paths .
18:33:012:0	Behold , in this thou art not just : I will answer thee , that God is greater than man .
18:33:013:0	Why dost thou strive against him ? for he giveth not account of any of his matters .
18:33:014:0	For God speaketh once , yea twice , yet man perceiveth it not .
18:33:015:0	In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ;
18:33:016:0	Then he openeth the ears of men , and sealeth their instruction ,
18:33:017:0	That he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
18:33:018:0	He keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
18:33:019:0	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong pain :
18:33:020:0	So that his life abhorreth bread , and his soul dainty meat .
18:33:021:0	His flesh is consumed away , that it cannot be seen ; and his bones that were not seen stick out .
18:33:022:0	Yea , his soul draweth near unto the grave , and his life to the destroyers .
18:33:023:0	If there be a messenger with him , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to shew unto man his uprightness :
18:33:024:0	Then he is gracious unto him , and saith , Deliver him from going down to the pit : I have found a ransom .
18:33:025:0	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's : he shall return to the days of his youth :
18:33:026:0	He shall pray unto God , and he will be favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will render unto man his righteousness .
18:33:027:0	He looketh upon men , and if any say , I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ;
18:33:028:0	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
18:33:029:0	Lo , all these things worketh God oftentimes with man ,
18:33:030:0	To bring back his soul from the pit , to be enlightened with the light of the living .
18:33:031:0	Mark well , O Job , hearken unto me : hold thy peace , and I will speak .
18:33:032:0	If thou hast any thing to say , answer me : speak , for I desire to justify thee .
18:33:033:0	If not , hearken unto me : hold thy peace , and I shall teach thee wisdom .
