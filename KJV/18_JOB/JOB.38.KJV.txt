18:38:001:0	Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
18:38:002:0	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ?
18:38:003:0	Gird up now thy loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and answer thou me .
18:38:004:0	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ? declare , if thou hast understanding .
18:38:005:0	Who hath laid the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? or who hath stretched the line upon it ?
18:38:006:0	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened ? or who laid the corner stone thereof ;
18:38:007:0	When the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
18:38:008:0	Or who shut up the sea with doors , when it brake forth , as if it had issued out of the womb ?
18:38:009:0	When I made the cloud the garment thereof , and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it ,
18:38:010:0	And brake up for it my decreed place , and set bars and doors ,
18:38:011:0	And said , Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ?
18:38:012:0	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days ; and caused the dayspring to know his place ;
18:38:013:0	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
18:38:014:0	It is turned as clay to the seal ; and they stand as a garment .
18:38:015:0	And from the wicked their light is withholden , and the high arm shall be broken .
18:38:016:0	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea ? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth ?
18:38:017:0	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee ? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
18:38:018:0	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth ? declare if thou knowest it all .
18:38:019:0	Where is the way where light dwelleth ? and as for darkness , where is the place thereof ,
18:38:020:0	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
18:38:021:0	Knowest thou it , because thou wast then born ? or because the number of thy days is great ?
18:38:022:0	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow ? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail ,
18:38:023:0	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble , against the day of battle and war ?
18:38:024:0	By what way is the light parted , which scattereth the east wind upon the earth ?
18:38:025:0	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters , or a way for the lightning of thunder ;
18:38:026:0	To cause it to rain on the earth , where no man is ; on the wilderness , wherein there is no man ;
18:38:027:0	To satisfy the desolate and waste ground ; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth ?
18:38:028:0	Hath the rain a father ? or who hath begotten the drops of dew ?
18:38:029:0	Out of whose womb came the ice ? and the hoary frost of heaven , who hath gendered it ?
18:38:030:0	The waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
18:38:031:0	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades , or loose the bands of Orion ?
18:38:032:0	Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season ? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons ?
18:38:033:0	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven ? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth ?
18:38:034:0	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that abundance of waters may cover thee ?
18:38:035:0	Canst thou send lightnings , that they may go , and say unto thee , Here we are ?
18:38:036:0	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the heart ?
18:38:037:0	Who can number the clouds in wisdom ? or who can stay the bottles of heaven ,
18:38:038:0	When the dust groweth into hardness , and the clods cleave fast together ?
18:38:039:0	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion ? or fill the appetite of the young lions ,
18:38:040:0	When they couch in their dens , and abide in the covert to lie in wait ?
18:38:041:0	Who provideth for the raven his food ? when his young ones cry unto God , they wander for lack of meat .
