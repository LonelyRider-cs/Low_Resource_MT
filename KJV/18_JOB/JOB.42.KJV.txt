18:42:001:0	Then Job answered the , and said ,
18:42:002:0	I know that thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee .
18:42:003:0	Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge ? therefore have I uttered that I understood not ; things too wonderful for me , which I knew not .
18:42:004:0	Hear , I beseech thee , and I will speak : I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
18:42:005:0	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee .
18:42:006:0	Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes .
18:42:007:0	And it was so , that after the had spoken these words unto Job , the said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled against thee , and against thy two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job hath .
18:42:008:0	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams , and go to my servant Job , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering ; and my servant Job shall pray for you : for him will I accept : lest I deal with you after your folly , in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right , like my servant Job .
18:42:009:0	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went , and did according as the commanded them : the also accepted Job .
18:42:010:0	And the turned the captivity of Job , when he prayed for his friends : also the gave Job twice as much as he had before .
18:42:011:0	Then came there unto him all his brethren , and all his sisters , and all they that had been of his acquaintance before , and did eat bread with him in his house : and they bemoaned him , and comforted him over all the evil that the had brought upon him : every man also gave him a piece of money , and every one an earring of gold .
18:42:012:0	So the blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
18:42:013:0	He had also seven sons and three daughters .
18:42:014:0	And he called the name of the first , Jemima ; and the name of the second , Kezia ; and the name of the third , Kerenâ€“happuch .
18:42:015:0	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren .
18:42:016:0	After this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
18:42:017:0	So Job died , being old and full of days .
