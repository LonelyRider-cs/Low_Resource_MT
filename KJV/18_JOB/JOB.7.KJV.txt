18:7:001:0	Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth ? are not his days also like the days of an hireling ?
18:7:002:0	As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work :
18:7:003:0	So am I made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
18:7:004:0	When I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
18:7:005:0	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and become loathsome .
18:7:006:0	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle , and are spent without hope .
18:7:007:0	O remember that my life is wind : mine eye shall no more see good .
18:7:008:0	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more : thine eyes are upon me , and I am not .
18:7:009:0	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away : so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more .
18:7:010:0	He shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
18:7:011:0	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
18:7:012:0	Am I a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch over me ?
18:7:013:0	When I say , My bed shall comfort me , my couch shall ease my complaint ;
18:7:014:0	Then thou scarest me with dreams , and terrifiest me through visions :
18:7:015:0	So that my soul chooseth strangling , and death rather than my life .
18:7:016:0	I loathe it ; I would not live alway : let me alone ; for my days are vanity .
18:7:017:0	What is man , that thou shouldest magnify him ? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him ?
18:7:018:0	And that thou shouldest visit him every morning , and try him every moment ?
18:7:019:0	How long wilt thou not depart from me , nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle ?
18:7:020:0	I have sinned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserver of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
18:7:021:0	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
