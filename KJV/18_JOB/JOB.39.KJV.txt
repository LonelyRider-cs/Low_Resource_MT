18:39:001:0	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve ?
18:39:002:0	Canst thou number the months that they fulfil ? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
18:39:003:0	They bow themselves , they bring forth their young ones , they cast out their sorrows .
18:39:004:0	Their young ones are in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto them .
18:39:005:0	Who hath sent out the wild ass free ? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass ?
18:39:006:0	Whose house I have made the wilderness , and the barren land his dwellings .
18:39:007:0	He scorneth the multitude of the city , neither regardeth he the crying of the driver .
18:39:008:0	The range of the mountains is his pasture , and he searcheth after every green thing .
18:39:009:0	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy crib ?
18:39:010:0	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow ? or will he harrow the valleys after thee ?
18:39:011:0	Wilt thou trust him , because his strength is great ? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him ?
18:39:012:0	Wilt thou believe him , that he will bring home thy seed , and gather it into thy barn ?
18:39:013:0	Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks ? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich ?
18:39:014:0	Which leaveth her eggs in the earth , and warmeth them in dust ,
18:39:015:0	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them , or that the wild beast may break them .
18:39:016:0	She is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in vain without fear ;
18:39:017:0	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom , neither hath he imparted to her understanding .
18:39:018:0	What time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
18:39:019:0	Hast thou given the horse strength ? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder ?
18:39:020:0	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper ? the glory of his nostrils is terrible .
18:39:021:0	He paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength : he goeth on to meet the armed men .
18:39:022:0	He mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from the sword .
18:39:023:0	The quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and the shield .
18:39:024:0	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
18:39:025:0	He saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
18:39:026:0	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward the south ?
18:39:027:0	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her nest on high ?
18:39:028:0	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
18:39:029:0	From thence she seeketh the prey , and her eyes behold afar off .
18:39:030:0	Her young ones also suck up blood : and where the slain are , there is she .
