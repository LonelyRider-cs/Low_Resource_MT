18:13:001:0	Lo , mine eye hath seen all this , mine ear hath heard and understood it .
18:13:002:0	What ye know , the same do I know also : I am not inferior unto you .
18:13:003:0	Surely I would speak to the Almighty , and I desire to reason with God .
18:13:004:0	But ye are forgers of lies , ye are all physicians of no value .
18:13:005:0	O that ye would altogether hold your peace ! and it should be your wisdom .
18:13:006:0	Hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips .
18:13:007:0	Will ye speak wickedly for God ? and talk deceitfully for him ?
18:13:008:0	Will ye accept his person ? will ye contend for God ?
18:13:009:0	Is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another , do ye so mock him ?
18:13:010:0	He will surely reprove you , if ye do secretly accept persons .
18:13:011:0	Shall not his excellency make you afraid ? and his dread fall upon you ?
18:13:012:0	Your remembrances are like unto ashes , your bodies to bodies of clay .
18:13:013:0	Hold your peace , let me alone , that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
18:13:014:0	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in mine hand ?
18:13:015:0	Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintain mine own ways before him .
18:13:016:0	He also shall be my salvation : for an hypocrite shall not come before him .
18:13:017:0	Hear diligently my speech , and my declaration with your ears .
18:13:018:0	Behold now , I have ordered my cause ; I know that I shall be justified .
18:13:019:0	Who is he that will plead with me ? for now , if I hold my tongue , I shall give up the ghost .
18:13:020:0	Only do not two things unto me : then will I not hide myself from thee .
18:13:021:0	Withdraw thine hand far from me : and let not thy dread make me afraid .
18:13:022:0	Then call thou , and I will answer : or let me speak , and answer thou me .
18:13:023:0	How many are mine iniquities and sins ? make me to know my transgression and my sin .
18:13:024:0	Wherefore hidest thou thy face , and holdest me for thine enemy ?
18:13:025:0	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro ? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble ?
18:13:026:0	For thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
18:13:027:0	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
18:13:028:0	And he , as a rotten thing , consumeth , as a garment that is moth eaten .
