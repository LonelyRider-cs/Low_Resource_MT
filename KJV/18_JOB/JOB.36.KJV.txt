18:36:001:0	Elihu also proceeded , and said ,
18:36:002:0	Suffer me a little , and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf .
18:36:003:0	I will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker .
18:36:004:0	For truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee .
18:36:005:0	Behold , God is mighty , and despiseth not any : he is mighty in strength and wisdom .
18:36:006:0	He preserveth not the life of the wicked : but giveth right to the poor .
18:36:007:0	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
18:36:008:0	And if they be bound in fetters , and be holden in cords of affliction ;
18:36:009:0	Then he sheweth them their work , and their transgressions that they have exceeded .
18:36:010:0	He openeth also their ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
18:36:011:0	If they obey and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
18:36:012:0	But if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
18:36:013:0	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath : they cry not when he bindeth them .
18:36:014:0	They die in youth , and their life is among the unclean .
18:36:015:0	He delivereth the poor in his affliction , and openeth their ears in oppression .
18:36:016:0	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness .
18:36:017:0	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee .
18:36:018:0	Because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee .
18:36:019:0	Will he esteem thy riches ? no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
18:36:020:0	Desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place .
18:36:021:0	Take heed , regard not iniquity : for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction .
18:36:022:0	Behold , God exalteth by his power : who teacheth like him ?
18:36:023:0	Who hath enjoined him his way ? or who can say , Thou hast wrought iniquity ?
18:36:024:0	Remember that thou magnify his work , which men behold .
18:36:025:0	Every man may see it ; man may behold it afar off .
18:36:026:0	Behold , God is great , and we know him not , neither can the number of his years be searched out .
18:36:027:0	For he maketh small the drops of water : they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof :
18:36:028:0	Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly .
18:36:029:0	Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of his tabernacle ?
18:36:030:0	Behold , he spreadeth his light upon it , and covereth the bottom of the sea .
18:36:031:0	For by them judgeth he the people ; he giveth meat in abundance .
18:36:032:0	With clouds he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt .
18:36:033:0	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it , the cattle also concerning the vapour .
