18:37:001:0	At this also my heart trembleth , and is moved out of his place .
18:37:002:0	Hear attentively the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth out of his mouth .
18:37:003:0	He directeth it under the whole heaven , and his lightning unto the ends of the earth .
18:37:004:0	After it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of his excellency ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard .
18:37:005:0	God thundereth marvellously with his voice ; great things doeth he , which we can not comprehend .
18:37:006:0	For he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
18:37:007:0	He sealeth up the hand of every man ; that all men may know his work .
18:37:008:0	Then the beasts go into dens , and remain in their places .
18:37:009:0	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind : and cold out of the north .
18:37:010:0	By the breath of God frost is given : and the breadth of the waters is straitened .
18:37:011:0	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud : he scattereth his bright cloud :
18:37:012:0	And it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
18:37:013:0	He causeth it to come , whether for correction , or for his land , or for mercy .
18:37:014:0	Hearken unto this , O Job : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God .
18:37:015:0	Dost thou know when God disposed them , and caused the light of his cloud to shine ?
18:37:016:0	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge ?
18:37:017:0	How thy garments are warm , when he quieteth the earth by the south wind ?
18:37:018:0	Hast thou with him spread out the sky , which is strong , and as a molten looking glass ?
18:37:019:0	Teach us what we shall say unto him ; for we can not order our speech by reason of darkness .
18:37:020:0	Shall it be told him that I speak ? if a man speak , surely he shall be swallowed up .
18:37:021:0	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but the wind passeth , and cleanseth them .
18:37:022:0	Fair weather cometh out of the north : with God is terrible majesty .
18:37:023:0	Touching the Almighty , we can not find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
18:37:024:0	Men do therefore fear him : he respecteth not any that are wise of heart .
