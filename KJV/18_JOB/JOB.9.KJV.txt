18:9:001:0	Then Job answered and said ,
18:9:002:0	I know it is so of a truth : but how should man be just with God ?
18:9:003:0	If he will contend with him , he can not answer him one of a thousand .
18:9:004:0	He is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against him , and hath prospered ?
18:9:005:0	Which removeth the mountains , and they know not : which overturneth them in his anger .
18:9:006:0	Which shaketh the earth out of her place , and the pillars thereof tremble .
18:9:007:0	Which commandeth the sun , and it riseth not ; and sealeth up the stars .
18:9:008:0	Which alone spreadeth out the heavens , and treadeth upon the waves of the sea .
18:9:009:0	Which maketh Arcturus , Orion , and Pleiades , and the chambers of the south .
18:9:010:0	Which doeth great things past finding out ; yea , and wonders without number .
18:9:011:0	Lo , he goeth by me , and I see him not : he passeth on also , but I perceive him not .
18:9:012:0	Behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ? who will say unto him , What doest thou ?
18:9:013:0	If God will not withdraw his anger , the proud helpers do stoop under him .
18:9:014:0	How much less shall I answer him , and choose out my words to reason with him ?
18:9:015:0	Whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not answer , but I would make supplication to my judge .
18:9:016:0	If I had called , and he had answered me ; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice .
18:9:017:0	For he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
18:9:018:0	He will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with bitterness .
18:9:019:0	If I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ?
18:9:020:0	If I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
18:9:021:0	Though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soul : I would despise my life .
18:9:022:0	This is one thing , therefore I said it , He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked .
18:9:023:0	If the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
18:9:024:0	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
18:9:025:0	Now my days are swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
18:9:026:0	They are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey .
18:9:027:0	If I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself :
18:9:028:0	I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent .
18:9:029:0	If I be wicked , why then labour I in vain ?
18:9:030:0	If I wash myself with snow water , and make my hands never so clean ;
18:9:031:0	Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine own clothes shall abhor me .
18:9:032:0	For he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , and we should come together in judgment .
18:9:033:0	Neither is there any daysman betwixt us , that might lay his hand upon us both .
18:9:034:0	Let him take his rod away from me , and let not his fear terrify me :
18:9:035:0	Then would I speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
