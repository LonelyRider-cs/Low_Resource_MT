18:22:001:0	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said ,
18:22:002:0	Can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
18:22:003:0	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that thou art righteous ? or is it gain to him , that thou makest thy ways perfect ?
18:22:004:0	Will he reprove thee for fear of thee ? will he enter with thee into judgment ?
18:22:005:0	Is not thy wickedness great ? and thine iniquities infinite ?
18:22:006:0	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
18:22:007:0	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
18:22:008:0	But as for the mighty man , he had the earth ; and the honourable man dwelt in it .
18:22:009:0	Thou hast sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
18:22:010:0	Therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ;
18:22:011:0	Or darkness , that thou canst not see ; and abundance of waters cover thee .
18:22:012:0	Is not God in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
18:22:013:0	And thou sayest , How doth God know ? can he judge through the dark cloud ?
18:22:014:0	Thick clouds are a covering to him , that he seeth not ; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven .
18:22:015:0	Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden ?
18:22:016:0	Which were cut down out of time , whose foundation was overflown with a flood :
18:22:017:0	Which said unto God , Depart from us : and what can the Almighty do for them ?
18:22:018:0	Yet he filled their houses with good things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
18:22:019:0	The righteous see it , and are glad : and the innocent laugh them to scorn .
18:22:020:0	Whereas our substance is not cut down , but the remnant of them the fire consumeth .
18:22:021:0	Acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
18:22:022:0	Receive , I pray thee , the law from his mouth , and lay up his words in thine heart .
18:22:023:0	If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles .
18:22:024:0	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks .
18:22:025:0	Yea , the Almighty shall be thy defence , and thou shalt have plenty of silver .
18:22:026:0	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto God .
18:22:027:0	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
18:22:028:0	Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
18:22:029:0	When men are cast down , then thou shalt say , There is lifting up ; and he shall save the humble person .
18:22:030:0	He shall deliver the island of the innocent : and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands .
