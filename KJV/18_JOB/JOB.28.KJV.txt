18:28:001:0	Surely there is a vein for the silver , and a place for gold where they fine it .
18:28:002:0	Iron is taken out of the earth , and brass is molten out of the stone .
18:28:003:0	He setteth an end to darkness , and searcheth out all perfection : the stones of darkness , and the shadow of death .
18:28:004:0	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
18:28:005:0	As for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire .
18:28:006:0	The stones of it are the place of sapphires : and it hath dust of gold .
18:28:007:0	There is a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture's eye hath not seen :
18:28:008:0	The lion's whelps have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it .
18:28:009:0	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock ; he overturneth the mountains by the roots .
18:28:010:0	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks ; and his eye seeth every precious thing .
18:28:011:0	He bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light .
18:28:012:0	But where shall wisdom be found ? and where is the place of understanding ?
18:28:013:0	Man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
18:28:014:0	The depth saith , It is not in me : and the sea saith , It is not with me .
18:28:015:0	It cannot be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof .
18:28:016:0	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
18:28:017:0	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold .
18:28:018:0	No mention shall be made of coral , or of pearls : for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
18:28:019:0	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it , neither shall it be valued with pure gold .
18:28:020:0	Whence then cometh wisdom ? and where is the place of understanding ?
18:28:021:0	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the fowls of the air .
18:28:022:0	Destruction and death say , We have heard the fame thereof with our ears .
18:28:023:0	God understandeth the way thereof , and he knoweth the place thereof .
18:28:024:0	For he looketh to the ends of the earth , and seeth under the whole heaven ;
18:28:025:0	To make the weight for the winds ; and he weigheth the waters by measure .
18:28:026:0	When he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the thunder :
18:28:027:0	Then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , yea , and searched it out .
18:28:028:0	And unto man he said , Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
