18:12:001:0	And Job answered and said ,
18:12:002:0	No doubt but ye are the people , and wisdom shall die with you .
18:12:003:0	But I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you : yea , who knoweth not such things as these ?
18:12:004:0	I am as one mocked of his neighbour , who calleth upon God , and he answereth him : the just upright man is laughed to scorn .
18:12:005:0	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
18:12:006:0	The tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that provoke God are secure ; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly .
18:12:007:0	But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee :
18:12:008:0	Or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee : and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
18:12:009:0	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this ?
18:12:010:0	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind .
18:12:011:0	Doth not the ear try words ? and the mouth taste his meat ?
18:12:012:0	With the ancient is wisdom ; and in length of days understanding .
18:12:013:0	With him is wisdom and strength , he hath counsel and understanding .
18:12:014:0	Behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
18:12:015:0	Behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up : also he sendeth them out , and they overturn the earth .
18:12:016:0	With him is strength and wisdom : the deceived and the deceiver are his .
18:12:017:0	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled , and maketh the judges fools .
18:12:018:0	He looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loins with a girdle .
18:12:019:0	He leadeth princes away spoiled , and overthroweth the mighty .
18:12:020:0	He removeth away the speech of the trusty , and taketh away the understanding of the aged .
18:12:021:0	He poureth contempt upon princes , and weakeneth the strength of the mighty .
18:12:022:0	He discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
18:12:023:0	He increaseth the nations , and destroyeth them : he enlargeth the nations , and straiteneth them again .
18:12:024:0	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
18:12:025:0	They grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man .
