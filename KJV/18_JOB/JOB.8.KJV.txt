18:8:001:0	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite , and said ,
18:8:002:0	How long wilt thou speak these things ? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind ?
18:8:003:0	Doth God pervert judgment ? or doth the Almighty pervert justice ?
18:8:004:0	If thy children have sinned against him , and he have cast them away for their transgression ;
18:8:005:0	If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes , and make thy supplication to the Almighty ;
18:8:006:0	If thou wert pure and upright ; surely now he would awake for thee , and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous .
18:8:007:0	Though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
18:8:008:0	For enquire , I pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers :
18:8:009:0	( For we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days upon earth are a shadow : )
18:8:010:0	Shall not they teach thee , and tell thee , and utter words out of their heart ?
18:8:011:0	Can the rush grow up without mire ? can the flag grow without water ?
18:8:012:0	Whilst it is yet in his greenness , and not cut down , it withereth before any other herb .
18:8:013:0	So are the paths of all that forget God ; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish :
18:8:014:0	Whose hope shall be cut off , and whose trust shall be a spider's web .
18:8:015:0	He shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand : he shall hold it fast , but it shall not endure .
18:8:016:0	He is green before the sun , and his branch shooteth forth in his garden .
18:8:017:0	His roots are wrapped about the heap , and seeth the place of stones .
18:8:018:0	If he destroy him from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , I have not seen thee .
18:8:019:0	Behold , this is the joy of his way , and out of the earth shall others grow .
18:8:020:0	Behold , God will not cast away a perfect man , neither will he help the evil doers :
18:8:021:0	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing , and thy lips with rejoicing .
18:8:022:0	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought .
