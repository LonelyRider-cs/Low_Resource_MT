18:16:001:0	Then Job answered and said ,
18:16:002:0	I have heard many such things : miserable comforters are ye all .
18:16:003:0	Shall vain words have an end ? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest ?
18:16:004:0	I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul 's stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
18:16:005:0	But I would strengthen you with my mouth , and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief .
18:16:006:0	Though I speak , my grief is not assuaged : and though I forbear , what am I eased ?
18:16:007:0	But now he hath made me weary : thou hast made desolate all my company .
18:16:008:0	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
18:16:009:0	He teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me .
18:16:010:0	They have gaped upon me with their mouth ; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
18:16:011:0	God hath delivered me to the ungodly , and turned me over into the hands of the wicked .
18:16:012:0	I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
18:16:013:0	His archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
18:16:014:0	He breaketh me with breach upon breach , he runneth upon me like a giant .
18:16:015:0	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin , and defiled my horn in the dust .
18:16:016:0	My face is foul with weeping , and on my eyelids is the shadow of death ;
18:16:017:0	Not for any injustice in mine hands : also my prayer is pure .
18:16:018:0	O earth , cover not thou my blood , and let my cry have no place .
18:16:019:0	Also now , behold , my witness is in heaven , and my record is on high .
18:16:020:0	My friends scorn me : but mine eye poureth out tears unto God .
18:16:021:0	O that one might plead for a man with God , as a man pleadeth for his neighbour !
18:16:022:0	When a few years are come , then I shall go the way whence I shall not return .
