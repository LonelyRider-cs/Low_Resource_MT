18:20:001:0	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite , and said ,
18:20:002:0	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer , and for this I make haste .
18:20:003:0	I have heard the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer .
18:20:004:0	Knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
18:20:005:0	That the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment ?
18:20:006:0	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens , and his head reach unto the clouds ;
18:20:007:0	Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung : they which have seen him shall say , Where is he ?
18:20:008:0	He shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night .
18:20:009:0	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more ; neither shall his place any more behold him .
18:20:010:0	His children shall seek to please the poor , and his hands shall restore their goods .
18:20:011:0	His bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
18:20:012:0	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth , though he hide it under his tongue ;
18:20:013:0	Though he spare it , and forsake it not ; but keep it still within his mouth :
18:20:014:0	Yet his meat in his bowels is turned , it is the gall of asps within him .
18:20:015:0	He hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again : God shall cast them out of his belly .
18:20:016:0	He shall suck the poison of asps : the viper's tongue shall slay him .
18:20:017:0	He shall not see the rivers , the floods , the brooks of honey and butter .
18:20:018:0	That which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
18:20:019:0	Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor ; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not ;
18:20:020:0	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
18:20:021:0	There shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
18:20:022:0	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits : every hand of the wicked shall come upon him .
18:20:023:0	When he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
18:20:024:0	He shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steel shall strike him through .
18:20:025:0	It is drawn , and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glittering sword cometh out of his gall : terrors are upon him .
18:20:026:0	All darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
18:20:027:0	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity ; and the earth shall rise up against him .
18:20:028:0	The increase of his house shall depart , and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath .
18:20:029:0	This is the portion of a wicked man from God , and the heritage appointed unto him by God .
