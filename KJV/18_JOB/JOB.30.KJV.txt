18:30:001:0	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock .
18:30:002:0	Yea , whereto might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom old age was perished ?
18:30:003:0	For want and famine they were solitary ; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste .
18:30:004:0	Who cut up mallows by the bushes , and juniper roots for their meat .
18:30:005:0	They were driven forth from among men , ( they cried after them as after a thief ; )
18:30:006:0	To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys , in caves of the earth , and in the rocks .
18:30:007:0	Among the bushes they brayed ; under the nettles they were gathered together .
18:30:008:0	They were children of fools , yea , children of base men : they were viler than the earth .
18:30:009:0	And now am I their song , yea , I am their byword .
18:30:010:0	They abhor me , they flee far from me , and spare not to spit in my face .
18:30:011:0	Because he hath loosed my cord , and afflicted me , they have also let loose the bridle before me .
18:30:012:0	Upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
18:30:013:0	They mar my path , they set forward my calamity , they have no helper .
18:30:014:0	They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me .
18:30:015:0	Terrors are turned upon me : they pursue my soul as the wind : and my welfare passeth away as a cloud .
18:30:016:0	And now my soul is poured out upon me ; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me .
18:30:017:0	My bones are pierced in me in the night season : and my sinews take no rest .
18:30:018:0	By the great force of my disease is my garment changed : it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat .
18:30:019:0	He hath cast me into the mire , and I am become like dust and ashes .
18:30:020:0	I cry unto thee , and thou dost not hear me : I stand up , and thou regardest me not .
18:30:021:0	Thou art become cruel to me : with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me .
18:30:022:0	Thou liftest me up to the wind ; thou causest me to ride upon it , and dissolvest my substance .
18:30:023:0	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living .
18:30:024:0	Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though they cry in his destruction .
18:30:025:0	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble ? was not my soul grieved for the poor ?
18:30:026:0	When I looked for good , then evil came unto me : and when I waited for light , there came darkness .
18:30:027:0	My bowels boiled , and rested not : the days of affliction prevented me .
18:30:028:0	I went mourning without the sun : I stood up , and I cried in the congregation .
18:30:029:0	I am a brother to dragons , and a companion to owls .
18:30:030:0	My skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat .
18:30:031:0	My harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that weep .
