18:10:001:0	My soul is weary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon myself ; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
18:10:002:0	I will say unto God , Do not condemn me ; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me .
18:10:003:0	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
18:10:004:0	Hast thou eyes of flesh ? or seest thou as man seeth ?
18:10:005:0	Are thy days as the days of man ? are thy years as man 's days ,
18:10:006:0	That thou enquirest after mine iniquity , and searchest after my sin ?
18:10:007:0	Thou knowest that I am not wicked ; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand .
18:10:008:0	Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about ; yet thou dost destroy me .
18:10:009:0	Remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and wilt thou bring me into dust again ?
18:10:010:0	Hast thou not poured me out as milk , and curdled me like cheese ?
18:10:011:0	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh , and hast fenced me with bones and sinews .
18:10:012:0	Thou hast granted me life and favour , and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit .
18:10:013:0	And these things hast thou hid in thine heart : I know that this is with thee .
18:10:014:0	If I sin , then thou markest me , and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity .
18:10:015:0	If I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
18:10:016:0	For it increaseth . Thou huntest me as a fierce lion : and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me .
18:10:017:0	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me , and increasest thine indignation upon me ; changes and war are against me .
18:10:018:0	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
18:10:019:0	I should have been as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
18:10:020:0	Are not my days few ? cease then , and let me alone , that I may take comfort a little ,
18:10:021:0	Before I go whence I shall not return , even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ;
18:10:022:0	A land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
