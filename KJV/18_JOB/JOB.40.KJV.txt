18:40:001:0	Moreover the answered Job , and said ,
18:40:002:0	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him ? he that reproveth God , let him answer it .
18:40:003:0	Then Job answered the , and said ,
18:40:004:0	Behold , I am vile ; what shall I answer thee ? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth .
18:40:005:0	Once have I spoken ; but I will not answer : yea , twice ; but I will proceed no further .
18:40:006:0	Then answered the unto Job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
18:40:007:0	Gird up thy loins now like a man : I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
18:40:008:0	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment ? wilt thou condemn me , that thou mayest be righteous ?
18:40:009:0	Hast thou an arm like God ? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him ?
18:40:010:0	Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency ; and array thyself with glory and beauty .
18:40:011:0	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath : and behold every one that is proud , and abase him .
18:40:012:0	Look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tread down the wicked in their place .
18:40:013:0	Hide them in the dust together ; and bind their faces in secret .
18:40:014:0	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
18:40:015:0	Behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
18:40:016:0	Lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the navel of his belly .
18:40:017:0	He moveth his tail like a cedar : the sinews of his stones are wrapped together .
18:40:018:0	His bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron .
18:40:019:0	He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
18:40:020:0	Surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
18:40:021:0	He lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the reed , and fens .
18:40:022:0	The shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the brook compass him about .
18:40:023:0	Behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth .
18:40:024:0	He taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares .
