18:23:001:0	Then Job answered and said ,
18:23:002:0	Even to day is my complaint bitter : my stroke is heavier than my groaning .
18:23:003:0	Oh that I knew where I might find him ! that I might come even to his seat !
18:23:004:0	I would order my cause before him , and fill my mouth with arguments .
18:23:005:0	I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would say unto me .
18:23:006:0	Will he plead against me with his great power ? No ; but he would put strength in me .
18:23:007:0	There the righteous might dispute with him ; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge .
18:23:008:0	Behold , I go forward , but he is not there ; and backward , but I can not perceive him :
18:23:009:0	On the left hand , where he doth work , but I can not behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I can not see him :
18:23:010:0	But he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
18:23:011:0	My foot hath held his steps , his way have I kept , and not declined .
18:23:012:0	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips ; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
18:23:013:0	But he is in one mind , and who can turn him ? and what his soul desireth , even that he doeth .
18:23:014:0	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me : and many such things are with him .
18:23:015:0	Therefore am I troubled at his presence : when I consider , I am afraid of him .
18:23:016:0	For God maketh my heart soft , and the Almighty troubleth me :
18:23:017:0	Because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he covered the darkness from my face .
