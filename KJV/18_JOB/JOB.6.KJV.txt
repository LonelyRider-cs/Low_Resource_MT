18:6:001:0	But Job answered and said ,
18:6:002:0	Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed , and my calamity laid in the balances together !
18:6:003:0	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea : therefore my words are swallowed up .
18:6:004:0	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me , the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit : the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me .
18:6:005:0	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass ? or loweth the ox over his fodder ?
18:6:006:0	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
18:6:007:0	The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat .
18:6:008:0	Oh that I might have my request ; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for !
18:6:009:0	Even that it would please God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
18:6:010:0	Then should I yet have comfort ; yea , I would harden myself in sorrow : let him not spare ; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
18:6:011:0	What is my strength , that I should hope ? and what is mine end , that I should prolong my life ?
18:6:012:0	Is my strength the strength of stones ? or is my flesh of brass ?
18:6:013:0	Is not my help in me ? and is wisdom driven quite from me ?
18:6:014:0	To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend ; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty .
18:6:015:0	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook , and as the stream of brooks they pass away ;
18:6:016:0	Which are blackish by reason of the ice , and wherein the snow is hid :
18:6:017:0	What time they wax warm , they vanish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
18:6:018:0	The paths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing , and perish .
18:6:019:0	The troops of Tema looked , the companies of Sheba waited for them .
18:6:020:0	They were confounded because they had hoped ; they came thither , and were ashamed .
18:6:021:0	For now ye are nothing ; ye see my casting down , and are afraid .
18:6:022:0	Did I say , Bring unto me ? or , Give a reward for me of your substance ?
18:6:023:0	Or , Deliver me from the enemy's hand ? or , Redeem me from the hand of the mighty ?
18:6:024:0	Teach me , and I will hold my tongue : and cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
18:6:025:0	How forcible are right words ! but what doth your arguing reprove ?
18:6:026:0	Do ye imagine to reprove words , and the speeches of one that is desperate , which are as wind ?
18:6:027:0	Yea , ye overwhelm the fatherless , and ye dig a pit for your friend .
18:6:028:0	Now therefore be content , look upon me ; for it is evident unto you if I lie .
18:6:029:0	Return , I pray you , let it not be iniquity ; yea , return again , my righteousness is in it .
18:6:030:0	Is there iniquity in my tongue ? cannot my taste discern perverse things ?
