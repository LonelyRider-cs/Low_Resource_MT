18:41:001:0	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook ? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
18:41:002:0	Canst thou put an hook into his nose ? or bore his jaw through with a thorn ?
18:41:003:0	Will he make many supplications unto thee ? will he speak soft words unto thee ?
18:41:004:0	Will he make a covenant with thee ? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever ?
18:41:005:0	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird ? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens ?
18:41:006:0	Shall the companions make a banquet of him ? shall they part him among the merchants ?
18:41:007:0	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ? or his head with fish spears ?
18:41:008:0	Lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
18:41:009:0	Behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
18:41:010:0	None is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
18:41:011:0	Who hath prevented me , that I should repay him ? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine .
18:41:012:0	I will not conceal his parts , nor his power , nor his comely proportion .
18:41:013:0	Who can discover the face of his garment ? or who can come to him with his double bridle ?
18:41:014:0	Who can open the doors of his face ? his teeth are terrible round about .
18:41:015:0	His scales are his pride , shut up together as with a close seal .
18:41:016:0	One is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
18:41:017:0	They are joined one to another , they stick together , that they can not be sundered .
18:41:018:0	By his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
18:41:019:0	Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out .
18:41:020:0	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron .
18:41:021:0	His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
18:41:022:0	In his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy before him .
18:41:023:0	The flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they can not be moved .
18:41:024:0	His heart is as firm as a stone ; yea , as hard as a piece of the nether millstone .
18:41:025:0	When he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of breakings they purify themselves .
18:41:026:0	The sword of him that layeth at him can not hold : the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon .
18:41:027:0	He esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood .
18:41:028:0	The arrow can not make him flee : slingstones are turned with him into stubble .
18:41:029:0	Darts are counted as stubble : he laugheth at the shaking of a spear .
18:41:030:0	Sharp stones are under him : he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire .
18:41:031:0	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment .
18:41:032:0	He maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
18:41:033:0	Upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear .
18:41:034:0	He beholdeth all high things : he is a king over all the children of pride .
