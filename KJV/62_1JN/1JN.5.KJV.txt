62:5:001:0	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
62:5:002:0	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .
62:5:003:0	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
62:5:004:0	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
62:5:005:0	Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62:5:006:0	This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
62:5:007:0	For there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
62:5:008:0	And there are three that bear witness in earth , the Spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three agree in one .
62:5:009:0	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
62:5:010:0	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
62:5:011:0	And this is the record , that God hath given to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62:5:012:0	He that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life .
62:5:013:0	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
62:5:014:0	And this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us :
62:5:015:0	And if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
62:5:016:0	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death . There is a sin unto death : I do not say that he shall pray for it .
62:5:017:0	All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
62:5:018:0	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
62:5:019:0	And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
62:5:020:0	And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .
62:5:021:0	Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
