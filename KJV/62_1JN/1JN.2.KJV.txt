62:2:001:0	My little children , these things write I unto you , that ye sin not . And if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous :
62:2:002:0	And he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
62:2:003:0	And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
62:2:004:0	He that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
62:2:005:0	But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
62:2:006:0	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
62:2:007:0	Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
62:2:008:0	Again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
62:2:009:0	He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
62:2:010:0	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
62:2:011:0	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
62:2:012:0	I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
62:2:013:0	I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
62:2:014:0	I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
62:2:015:0	Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62:2:016:0	For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
62:2:017:0	And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
62:2:018:0	Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
62:2:019:0	They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
62:2:020:0	But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
62:2:021:0	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
62:2:022:0	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
62:2:023:0	Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
62:2:024:0	Let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
62:2:025:0	And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
62:2:026:0	These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
62:2:027:0	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
62:2:028:0	And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
62:2:029:0	If ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
