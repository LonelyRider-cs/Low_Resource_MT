62:3:001:0	Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
62:3:002:0	Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
62:3:003:0	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
62:3:004:0	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
62:3:005:0	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
62:3:006:0	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
62:3:007:0	Little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
62:3:008:0	He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
62:3:009:0	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
62:3:010:0	In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
62:3:011:0	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
62:3:012:0	Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother's righteous .
62:3:013:0	Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
62:3:014:0	We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
62:3:015:0	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
62:3:016:0	Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
62:3:017:0	But whoso hath this world's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
62:3:018:0	My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
62:3:019:0	And hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
62:3:020:0	For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
62:3:021:0	Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then have we confidence toward God .
62:3:022:0	And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
62:3:023:0	And this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
62:3:024:0	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . And hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the Spirit which he hath given us .
