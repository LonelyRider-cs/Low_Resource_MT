62:1:001:0	That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
62:1:002:0	( For the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
62:1:003:0	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62:1:004:0	And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
62:1:005:0	This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
62:1:006:0	If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
62:1:007:0	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
62:1:008:0	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
62:1:009:0	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
62:1:010:0	If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
