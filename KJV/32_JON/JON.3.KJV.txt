32:3:001:0	And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time , saying ,
32:3:002:0	Arise , go unto Nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee .
32:3:003:0	So Jonah arose , and went unto Nineveh , according to the word of the Lord . Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey .
32:3:004:0	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey , and he cried , and said , Yet forty days , and Nineveh shall be overthrown .
32:3:005:0	So the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
32:3:006:0	For word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
32:3:007:0	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste any thing : let them not feed , nor drink water :
32:3:008:0	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
32:3:009:0	Who can tell if God will turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
32:3:010:0	And God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
