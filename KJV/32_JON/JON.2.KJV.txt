32:2:001:0	Then Jonah prayed unto the his God out of the fish 's belly ,
32:2:002:0	And said , I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the , and he heard me ; out of the belly of hell cried I , and thou heardest my voice .
32:2:003:0	For thou hadst cast me into the deep , in the midst of the seas ; and the floods compassed me about : all thy billows and thy waves passed over me .
32:2:004:0	Then I said , I am cast out of thy sight ; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple .
32:2:005:0	The waters compassed me about , even to the soul : the depth closed me round about , the weeds were wrapped about my head .
32:2:006:0	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , O my God .
32:2:007:0	When my soul fainted within me I remembered the : and my prayer came in unto thee , into thine holy temple .
32:2:008:0	They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy .
32:2:009:0	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; I will pay that that I have vowed . Salvation is of the .
32:2:010:0	And the spake unto the fish , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land .
