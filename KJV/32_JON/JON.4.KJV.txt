32:4:001:0	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly , and he was very angry .
32:4:002:0	And he prayed unto the Lord , and said , I pray thee , O Lord , was not this my saying , when I was yet in my country ? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish : for I knew that thou art a gracious God , and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repentest thee of the evil .
32:4:003:0	Therefore now , O Lord , take , I beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
32:4:004:0	Then said the Lord , Doest thou well to be angry ?
32:4:005:0	So Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
32:4:006:0	And the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
32:4:007:0	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd that it withered .
32:4:008:0	And it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that God prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah , that he fainted , and wished in himself to die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
32:4:009:0	And God said to Jonah , Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? And he said , I do well to be angry , even unto death .
32:4:010:0	Then said the Lord , Thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
32:4:011:0	And should not I spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much cattle ?
