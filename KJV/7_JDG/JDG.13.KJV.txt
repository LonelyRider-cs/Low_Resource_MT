7:13:001:0	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the ; and the delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
7:13:002:0	And there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
7:13:003:0	And the angel of the appeared unto the woman , and said unto her , Behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceive , and bear a son .
7:13:004:0	Now therefore beware , I pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing :
7:13:005:0	For , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
7:13:006:0	Then the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came unto me , and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God , very terrible : but I asked him not whence he was , neither told he me his name :
7:13:007:0	But he said unto me , Behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death .
7:13:008:0	Then Manoah entreated the , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
7:13:009:0	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah her husband was not with her .
7:13:010:0	And the woman made haste , and ran , and shewed her husband , and said unto him , Behold , the man hath appeared unto me , that came unto me the other day .
7:13:011:0	And Manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said unto him , Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman ? And he said , I am .
7:13:012:0	And Manoah said , Now let thy words come to pass . How shall we order the child , and how shall we do unto him ?
7:13:013:0	And the angel of the said unto Manoah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
7:13:014:0	She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
7:13:015:0	And Manoah said unto the angel of the , I pray thee , let us detain thee , until we shall have made ready a kid for thee .
7:13:016:0	And the angel of the said unto Manoah , Though thou detain me , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the . For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the .
7:13:017:0	And Manoah said unto the angel of the , What is thy name , that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour ?
7:13:018:0	And the angel of the said unto him , Why askest thou thus after my name , seeing it is secret ?
7:13:019:0	So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the : and the angel did wondrously ; and Manoah and his wife looked on .
7:13:020:0	For it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the ascended in the flame of the altar . And Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
7:13:021:0	But the angel of the did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife . Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the .
7:13:022:0	And Manoah said unto his wife , We shall surely die , because we have seen God .
7:13:023:0	But his wife said unto him , If the were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these .
7:13:024:0	And the woman bare a son , and called his name Samson : and the child grew , and the blessed him .
7:13:025:0	And the Spirit of the began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol .
