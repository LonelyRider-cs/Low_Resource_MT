7:19:001:0	And it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Beth–lehem–judah .
7:19:002:0	And his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him unto her father 's house to Beth–lehem–judah , and was there four whole months .
7:19:003:0	And her husband arose , and went after her , to speak friendly unto her , and to bring her again , having his servant with him , and a couple of asses : and she brought him into her father 's house : and when the father of the damsel saw him , he rejoiced to meet him .
7:19:004:0	And his father in law , the damsel 's father , retained him ; and he abode with him three days : so they did eat and drink , and lodged there .
7:19:005:0	And it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel 's father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
7:19:006:0	And they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel 's father had said unto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
7:19:007:0	And when the man rose up to depart , his father in law urged him : therefore he lodged there again .
7:19:008:0	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart : and the damsel 's father said , Comfort thine heart , I pray thee . And they tarried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
7:19:009:0	And when the man rose up to depart , he , and his concubine , and his servant , his father in law , the damsel 's father , said unto him , Behold , now the day draweth toward evening , I pray you tarry all night : behold , the day groweth to an end , lodge here , that thine heart may be merry ; and to morrow get you early on your way , that thou mayest go home .
7:19:010:0	But the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
7:19:011:0	And when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
7:19:012:0	And his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
7:19:013:0	And he said unto his servant , Come , and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night , in Gibeah , or in Ramah .
7:19:014:0	And they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah , which belongeth to Benjamin .
7:19:015:0	And they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
7:19:016:0	And , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
7:19:017:0	And when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , Whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
7:19:018:0	And he said unto him , We are passing from Beth–lehem–judah toward the side of mount Ephraim ; from thence am I : and I went to Beth–lehem–judah , but I am now going to the house of the ; and there is no man that receiveth me to house .
7:19:019:0	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which is with thy servants : there is no want of any thing .
7:19:020:0	And the old man said , Peace be with thee ; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
7:19:021:0	So he brought him into his house , and gave provender unto the asses : and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
7:19:022:0	Now as they were making their hearts merry , behold , the men of the city , certain sons of Belial , beset the house round about , and beat at the door , and spake to the master of the house , the old man , saying , Bring forth the man that came into thine house , that we may know him .
7:19:023:0	And the man , the master of the house , went out unto them , and said unto them , Nay , my brethren , nay , I pray you , do not so wickedly ; seeing that this man is come into mine house , do not this folly .
7:19:024:0	Behold , here is my daughter a maiden , and his concubine ; them I will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing .
7:19:025:0	But the men would not hearken to him : so the man took his concubine , and brought her forth unto them ; and they knew her , and abused her all the night until the morning : and when the day began to spring , they let her go .
7:19:026:0	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
7:19:027:0	And her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
7:19:028:0	And he said unto her , Up , and let us be going . But none answered . Then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and gat him unto his place .
7:19:029:0	And when he was come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , together with her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the coasts of Israel .
7:19:030:0	And it was so , that all that saw it said , There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day : consider of it , take advice , and speak your minds .
