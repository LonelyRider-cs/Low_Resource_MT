7:3:001:0	Now these are the nations which the left , to prove Israel by them , even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan ;
7:3:002:0	Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ;
7:3:003:0	Namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal–hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
7:3:004:0	And they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
7:3:005:0	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites , and Jebusites :
7:3:006:0	And they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
7:3:007:0	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the , and forgat the their God , and served Baalim and the groves .
7:3:008:0	Therefore the anger of the was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Chushan–rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Chushan–rishathaim eight years .
7:3:009:0	And when the children of Israel cried unto the , the raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
7:3:010:0	And the Spirit of the came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the delivered Chushan–rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan–rishathaim .
7:3:011:0	And the land had rest forty years . And Othniel the son of Kenaz died .
7:3:012:0	And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the : and the strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the .
7:3:013:0	And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
7:3:014:0	So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years .
7:3:015:0	But when the children of Israel cried unto the , the raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
7:3:016:0	But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
7:3:017:0	And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab : and Eglon was a very fat man .
7:3:018:0	And when he had made an end to offer the present , he sent away the people that bare the present .
7:3:019:0	But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret errand unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . And all that stood by him went out from him .
7:3:020:0	And Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . And Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . And he arose out of his seat .
7:3:021:0	And Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly :
7:3:022:0	And the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
7:3:023:0	Then Ehud went forth through the porch , and shut the doors of the parlour upon him , and locked them .
7:3:024:0	When he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
7:3:025:0	And they tarried till they were ashamed : and , behold , he opened not the doors of the parlour ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
7:3:026:0	And Ehud escaped while they tarried , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped unto Seirath .
7:3:027:0	And it came to pass , when he was come , that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
7:3:028:0	And he said unto them , Follow after me : for the hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . And they went down after him , and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
7:3:029:0	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
7:3:030:0	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . And the land had rest fourscore years .
7:3:031:0	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath , which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad : and he also delivered Israel .
