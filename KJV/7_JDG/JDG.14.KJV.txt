7:14:001:0	And Samson went down to Timnah , and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines .
7:14:002:0	And he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
7:14:003:0	Then his father and his mother said unto him , Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines ? And Samson said unto his father , Get her for me ; for she pleaseth me well .
7:14:004:0	But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the , that he sought an occasion against the Philistines : for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel .
7:14:005:0	Then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah : and , behold , a young lion roared against him .
7:14:006:0	And the Spirit of the came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
7:14:007:0	And he went down , and talked with the woman ; and she pleased Samson well .
7:14:008:0	And after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion .
7:14:009:0	And he took thereof in his hands , and went on eating , and came to his father and mother , and he gave them , and they did eat : but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion .
7:14:010:0	So his father went down unto the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
7:14:011:0	And it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
7:14:012:0	And Samson said unto them , I will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments :
7:14:013:0	But if ye can not declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments . And they said unto him , Put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
7:14:014:0	And he said unto them , Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . And they could not in three days expound the riddle .
7:14:015:0	And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they said unto Samson 's wife , Entice thy husband , that he may declare unto us the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father 's house with fire : have ye called us to take that we have ? is it not so ?
7:14:016:0	And Samson 's wife wept before him , and said , Thou dost but hate me , and lovest me not : thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people , and hast not told it me . And he said unto her , Behold , I have not told it my father nor my mother , and shall I tell it thee ?
7:14:017:0	And she wept before him the seven days , while their feast lasted : and it came to pass on the seventh day , that he told her , because she lay sore upon him : and she told the riddle to the children of her people .
7:14:018:0	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down , What is sweeter than honey ? and what is stronger than a lion ? And he said unto them , If ye had not plowed with my heifer , ye had not found out my riddle .
7:14:019:0	And the Spirit of the came upon him , and he went down to Ashkelon , and slew thirty men of them , and took their spoil , and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle . And his anger was kindled , and he went up to his father 's house .
7:14:020:0	But Samson 's wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
