7:6:001:0	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the : and the delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
7:6:002:0	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
7:6:003:0	And so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
7:6:004:0	And they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
7:6:005:0	For they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as grasshoppers for multitude ; for both they and their camels were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
7:6:006:0	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites ; and the children of Israel cried unto the .
7:6:007:0	And it came to pass , when the children of Israel cried unto the because of the Midianites ,
7:6:008:0	That the sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
7:6:009:0	And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
7:6:010:0	And I said unto you , I am the your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
7:6:011:0	And there came an angel of the , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abi–ezrite : and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
7:6:012:0	And the angel of the appeared unto him , and said unto him , The is with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
7:6:013:0	And Gideon said unto him , Oh my Lord , if the be with us , why then is all this befallen us ? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of , saying , Did not the bring us up from Egypt ? but now the hath forsaken us , and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites .
7:6:014:0	And the looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites : have not I sent thee ?
7:6:015:0	And he said unto him , Oh my Lord , wherewith shall I save Israel ? behold , my family is poor in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father 's house .
7:6:016:0	And the said unto him , Surely I will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man .
7:6:017:0	And he said unto him , If now I have found grace in thy sight , then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me .
7:6:018:0	Depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . And he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
7:6:019:0	And Gideon went in , and made ready a kid , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out unto him under the oak , and presented it .
7:6:020:0	And the angel of God said unto him , Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth . And he did so .
7:6:021:0	Then the angel of the put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and there rose up fire out of the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes . Then the angel of the departed out of his sight .
7:6:022:0	And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the , Gideon said , Alas , O Lord ! for because I have seen an angel of the face to face .
7:6:023:0	And the said unto him , Peace be unto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die .
7:6:024:0	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the , and called it Jehovah–shalom : unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi–ezrites .
7:6:025:0	And it came to pass the same night , that the said unto him , Take thy father 's young bullock , even the second bullock of seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath , and cut down the grove that is by it :
7:6:026:0	And build an altar unto the thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
7:6:027:0	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
7:6:028:0	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast down , and the grove was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
7:6:029:0	And they said one to another , Who hath done this thing ? And when they enquired and asked , they said , Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing .
7:6:030:0	Then the men of the city said unto Joash , Bring out thy son , that he may die : because he hath cast down the altar of Baal , and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it .
7:6:031:0	And Joash said unto all that stood against him , Will ye plead for Baal ? will ye save him ? he that will plead for him , let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning : if he be a god , let him plead for himself , because one hath cast down his altar .
7:6:032:0	Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal , saying , Let Baal plead against him , because he hath thrown down his altar .
7:6:033:0	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pitched in the valley of Jezreel .
7:6:034:0	But the Spirit of the came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and Abi–ezer was gathered after him .
7:6:035:0	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto Asher , and unto Zebulun , and unto Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
7:6:036:0	And Gideon said unto God , If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said ,
7:6:037:0	Behold , I will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
7:6:038:0	And it was so : for he rose up early on the morrow , and thrust the fleece together , and wringed the dew out of the fleece , a bowl full of water .
7:6:039:0	And Gideon said unto God , Let not thine anger be hot against me , and I will speak but this once : let me prove , I pray thee , but this once with the fleece ; let it now be dry only upon the fleece , and upon all the ground let there be dew .
7:6:040:0	And God did so that night : for it was dry upon the fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
