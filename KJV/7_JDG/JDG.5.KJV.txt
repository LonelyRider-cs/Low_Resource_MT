7:5:001:0	Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day , saying ,
7:5:002:0	Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel , when the people willingly offered themselves .
7:5:003:0	Hear , O ye kings ; give ear , O ye princes ; I , even I , will sing unto the Lord ; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel .
7:5:004:0	Lord , when thou wentest out of Seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
7:5:005:0	The mountains melted from before the Lord , even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel .
7:5:006:0	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travellers walked through byways .
7:5:007:0	The inhabitants of the villages ceased , they ceased in Israel , until that I Deborah arose , that I arose a mother in Israel .
7:5:008:0	They chose new gods ; then was war in the gates : was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel ?
7:5:009:0	My heart is toward the governors of Israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . Bless ye the Lord .
7:5:010:0	Speak , ye that ride on white asses , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way .
7:5:011:0	They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
7:5:012:0	Awake , awake , Deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , Barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of Abinoam .
7:5:013:0	Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people : the Lord made me have dominion over the mighty .
7:5:014:0	Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
7:5:015:0	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
7:5:016:0	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds , to hear the bleatings of the flocks ? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart .
7:5:017:0	Gilead abode beyond Jordan : and why did Dan remain in ships ? Asher continued on the sea shore , and abode in his breaches .
7:5:018:0	Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field .
7:5:019:0	The kings came and fought , then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo ; they took no gain of money .
7:5:020:0	They fought from heaven ; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera .
7:5:021:0	The river of Kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river Kishon . O my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
7:5:022:0	Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings , the pransings of their mighty ones .
7:5:023:0	Curse ye Meroz , said the angel of the Lord , curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the Lord , to the help of the Lord against the mighty .
7:5:024:0	Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be , blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
7:5:025:0	He asked water , and she gave him milk ; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish .
7:5:026:0	She put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen's hammer ; and with the hammer she smote Sisera , she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
7:5:027:0	At her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
7:5:028:0	The mother of Sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice , Why is his chariot so long in coming ? why tarry the wheels of his chariots ?
7:5:029:0	Her wise ladies answered her , yea , she returned answer to herself ,
7:5:030:0	Have they not sped ? have they not divided the prey ; to every man a damsel or two ; to Sisera a prey of divers colours , a prey of divers colours of needlework , of divers colours of needlework on both sides , meet for the necks of them that take the spoil ?
7:5:031:0	So let all thine enemies perish , O Lord : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might . And the land had rest forty years .
