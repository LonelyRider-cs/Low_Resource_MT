7:2:001:0	And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers ; and I said , I will never break my covenant with you .
7:2:002:0	And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ?
7:2:003:0	Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
7:2:004:0	And it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
7:2:005:0	And they called the name of that place Bochim : and they sacrificed there unto the Lord .
7:2:006:0	And when Joshua had let the people go , the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land .
7:2:007:0	And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
7:2:008:0	And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
7:2:009:0	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathâ€“heres , in the mount of Ephraim , on the north side of the hill Gaash .
7:2:010:0	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , which knew not the Lord , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
7:2:011:0	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim :
7:2:012:0	And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the Lord to anger .
7:2:013:0	And they forsook the Lord , and served Baal and Ashtoreth .
7:2:014:0	And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
7:2:015:0	Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
7:2:016:0	Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges , which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them .
7:2:017:0	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
7:2:018:0	And when the Lord raised them up judges , then the Lord was with the judge , and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them .
7:2:019:0	And it came to pass , when the judge was dead , that they returned , and corrupted themselves more than their fathers , in following other gods to serve them , and to bow down unto them ; they ceased not from their own doings , nor from their stubborn way .
7:2:020:0	And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and he said , Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not hearkened unto my voice ;
7:2:021:0	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died :
7:2:022:0	That through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
7:2:023:0	Therefore the Lord left those nations , without driving them out hastily ; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua .
