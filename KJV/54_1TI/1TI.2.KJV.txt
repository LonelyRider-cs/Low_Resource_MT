54:2:001:0	I exhort therefore , that , first of all , supplications , prayers , intercessions , and giving of thanks , be made for all men ;
54:2:002:0	For kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
54:2:003:0	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ;
54:2:004:0	Who will have all men to be saved , and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
54:2:005:0	For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ;
54:2:006:0	Who gave himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time .
54:2:007:0	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
54:2:008:0	I will therefore that men pray every where , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and doubting .
54:2:009:0	In like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array ;
54:2:010:0	But ( which becometh women professing godliness ) with good works .
54:2:011:0	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
54:2:012:0	But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
54:2:013:0	For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
54:2:014:0	And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression .
54:2:015:0	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
