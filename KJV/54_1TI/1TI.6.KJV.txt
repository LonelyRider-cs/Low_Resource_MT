54:6:001:0	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
54:6:002:0	And they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort .
54:6:003:0	If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;
54:6:004:0	He is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and strifes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings ,
54:6:005:0	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds , and destitute of the truth , supposing that gain is godliness : from such withdraw thyself .
54:6:006:0	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
54:6:007:0	For we brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
54:6:008:0	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content .
54:6:009:0	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
54:6:010:0	For the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
54:6:011:0	But thou , O man of God , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
54:6:012:0	Fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
54:6:013:0	I give thee charge in the sight of God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession ;
54:6:014:0	That thou keep this commandment without spot , unrebukeable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ :
54:6:015:0	Which in his times he shall shew , who is the blessed and only Potentate , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
54:6:016:0	Who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting . Amen .
54:6:017:0	Charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not highminded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
54:6:018:0	That they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
54:6:019:0	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eternal life .
54:6:020:0	O Timothy , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding profane and vain babblings , and oppositions of science falsely so called :
54:6:021:0	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith . Grace be with thee . Amen .
