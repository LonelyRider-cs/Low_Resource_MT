54:5:001:0	Rebuke not an elder , but entreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ;
54:5:002:0	The elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , with all purity .
54:5:003:0	Honour widows that are widows indeed .
54:5:004:0	But if any widow have children or nephews , let them learn first to shew piety at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God .
54:5:005:0	Now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
54:5:006:0	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth .
54:5:007:0	And these things give in charge , that they may be blameless .
54:5:008:0	But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
54:5:009:0	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
54:5:010:0	Well reported of for good works ; if she have brought up children , if she have lodged strangers , if she have washed the saints' feet , if she have relieved the afflicted , if she have diligently followed every good work .
54:5:011:0	But the younger widows refuse : for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ , they will marry ;
54:5:012:0	Having damnation , because they have cast off their first faith .
54:5:013:0	And withal they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
54:5:014:0	I will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
54:5:015:0	For some are already turned aside after Satan .
54:5:016:0	If any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
54:5:017:0	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and doctrine .
54:5:018:0	For the scripture saith , Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn . And , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
54:5:019:0	Against an elder receive not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
54:5:020:0	Them that sin rebuke before all , that others also may fear .
54:5:021:0	I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
54:5:022:0	Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men's sins : keep thyself pure .
54:5:023:0	Drink no longer water , but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities .
54:5:024:0	Some men's sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
54:5:025:0	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid .
