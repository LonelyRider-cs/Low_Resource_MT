54:3:001:0	This is a true saying , If a man desire the office of a bishop , he desireth a good work .
54:3:002:0	A bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
54:3:003:0	Not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
54:3:004:0	One that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
54:3:005:0	( For if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
54:3:006:0	Not a novice , lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
54:3:007:0	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
54:3:008:0	Likewise must the deacons be grave , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
54:3:009:0	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
54:3:010:0	And let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
54:3:011:0	Even so must their wives be grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
54:3:012:0	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
54:3:013:0	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
54:3:014:0	These things write I unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly :
54:3:015:0	But if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
54:3:016:0	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
