14:14:001:0	So Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and Asa his son reigned in his stead . In his days the land was quiet ten years .
14:14:002:0	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God :
14:14:003:0	For he took away the altars of the strange gods , and the high places , and brake down the images , and cut down the groves :
14:14:004:0	And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
14:14:005:0	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
14:14:006:0	And he built fenced cities in Judah : for the land had rest , and he had no war in those years ; because the Lord had given him rest .
14:14:007:0	Therefore he said unto Judah , Let us build these cities , and make about them walls , and towers , gates , and bars , while the land is yet before us ; because we have sought the Lord our God , we have sought him , and he hath given us rest on every side . So they built and prospered .
14:14:008:0	And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
14:14:009:0	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots ; and came unto Mareshah .
14:14:010:0	Then Asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
14:14:011:0	And Asa cried unto the Lord his God , and said , Lord , it is nothing with thee to help , whether with many , or with them that have no power : help us , O Lord our God ; for we rest on thee , and in thy name we go against this multitude . O Lord , thou art our God ; let not man prevail against thee .
14:14:012:0	So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa , and before Judah ; and the Ethiopians fled .
14:14:013:0	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar : and the Ethiopians were overthrown , that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
14:14:014:0	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar ; for the fear of the Lord came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
14:14:015:0	They smote also the tents of cattle , and carried away sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to Jerusalem .
