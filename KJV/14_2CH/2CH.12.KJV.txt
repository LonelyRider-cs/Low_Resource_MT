14:12:001:0	And it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
14:12:002:0	And it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the Lord ,
14:12:003:0	With twelve hundred chariots , and threescore thousand horsemen : and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt ; the Libyans , the Sukkiims , and the Ethiopians .
14:12:004:0	And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah , and came to Jerusalem .
14:12:005:0	Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam , and to the princes of Judah , that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said unto them , Thus saith the Lord , Ye have forsaken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak .
14:12:006:0	Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves ; and they said , The Lord is righteous .
14:12:007:0	And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah , saying , They have humbled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
14:12:008:0	Nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries .
14:12:009:0	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
14:12:010:0	Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king's house .
14:12:011:0	And when the king entered into the house of the Lord , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
14:12:012:0	And when he humbled himself , the wrath of the Lord turned from him , that he would not destroy him altogether : and also in Judah things went well .
14:12:013:0	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem , and reigned : for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his name there . And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess .
14:12:014:0	And he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord .
14:12:015:0	Now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet , and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
14:12:016:0	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David : and Abijah his son reigned in his stead .
