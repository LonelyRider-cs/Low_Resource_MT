14:8:001:0	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years , wherein Solomon had built the house of the , and his own house ,
14:8:002:0	That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
14:8:003:0	And Solomon went to Hamath–zobah , and prevailed against it .
14:8:004:0	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the store cities , which he built in Hamath .
14:8:005:0	Also he built Beth–horon the upper , and Beth–horon the nether , fenced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
14:8:006:0	And Baalath , and all the store cities that Solomon had , and all the chariot cities , and the cities of the horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and throughout all the land of his dominion .
14:8:007:0	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
14:8:008:0	But of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
14:8:009:0	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
14:8:010:0	And these were the chief of king Solomon 's officers , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
14:8:011:0	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her : for he said , My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel , because the places are holy , whereunto the ark of the hath come .
14:8:012:0	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the on the altar of the , which he had built before the porch ,
14:8:013:0	Even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
14:8:014:0	And he appointed , according to the order of David his father , the courses of the priests to their service , and the Levites to their charges , to praise and minister before the priests , as the duty of every day required : the porters also by their courses at every gate : for so had David the man of God commanded .
14:8:015:0	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
14:8:016:0	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the , and until it was finished . So the house of the was perfected .
14:8:017:0	Then went Solomon to Ezion–geber , and to Eloth , at the sea side in the land of Edom .
14:8:018:0	And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
