14:10:001:0	And Rehoboam went to Shechem : for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king .
14:10:002:0	And it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
14:10:003:0	And they sent and called him . So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam , saying ,
14:10:004:0	Thy father made our yoke grievous : now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father , and his heavy yoke that he put upon us , and we will serve thee .
14:10:005:0	And he said unto them , Come again unto me after three days . And the people departed .
14:10:006:0	And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people ?
14:10:007:0	And they spake unto him , saying , If thou be kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , they will be thy servants for ever .
14:10:008:0	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
14:10:009:0	And he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us ?
14:10:010:0	And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins .
14:10:011:0	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
14:10:012:0	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day , as the king bade , saying , Come again to me on the third day .
14:10:013:0	And the king answered them roughly ; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men ,
14:10:014:0	And answered them after the advice of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add thereto : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
14:10:015:0	So the king hearkened not unto the people : for the cause was of God , that the Lord might perform his word , which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
14:10:016:0	And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them , the people answered the king , saying , What portion have we in David ? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse : every man to your tents , O Israel : and now , David , see to thine own house . So all Israel went to their tents .
14:10:017:0	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
14:10:018:0	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
14:10:019:0	And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day .
