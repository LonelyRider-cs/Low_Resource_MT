14:30:001:0	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel .
14:30:002:0	For the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
14:30:003:0	For they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
14:30:004:0	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation .
14:30:005:0	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel , from Beerâ€“sheba even to Dan , that they should come to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem : for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written .
14:30:006:0	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah , and according to the commandment of the king , saying , Ye children of Israel , turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , and he will return to the remnant of you , that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria .
14:30:007:0	And be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers , who therefore gave them up to desolation , as ye see .
14:30:008:0	Now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the Lord , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
14:30:009:0	For if ye turn again unto the Lord , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive , so that they shall come again into this land : for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful , and will not turn away his face from you , if ye return unto him .
14:30:010:0	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
14:30:011:0	Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves , and came to Jerusalem .
14:30:012:0	Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the Lord .
14:30:013:0	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great congregation .
14:30:014:0	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the brook Kidron .
14:30:015:0	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
14:30:016:0	And they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
14:30:017:0	For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the Lord .
14:30:018:0	For a multitude of the people , even many of Ephraim , and Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written . But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , The good Lord pardon every one
14:30:019:0	That prepareth his heart to seek God , the Lord God of his fathers , though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary .
14:30:020:0	And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people .
14:30:021:0	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
14:30:022:0	And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the Lord : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers .
14:30:023:0	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days : and they kept other seven days with gladness .
14:30:024:0	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
14:30:025:0	And all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
14:30:026:0	So there was great joy in Jerusalem : for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem .
14:30:027:0	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people : and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place , even unto heaven .
