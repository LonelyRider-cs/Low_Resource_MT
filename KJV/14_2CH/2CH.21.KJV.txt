14:21:001:0	Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
14:21:002:0	And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat , Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
14:21:003:0	And their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fenced cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram ; because he was the firstborn .
14:21:004:0	Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and divers also of the princes of Israel .
14:21:005:0	Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
14:21:006:0	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the .
14:21:007:0	Howbeit the would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
14:21:008:0	In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah , and made themselves a king .
14:21:009:0	Then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots .
14:21:010:0	So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand ; because he had forsaken the God of his fathers .
14:21:011:0	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah thereto .
14:21:012:0	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , Thus saith the God of David thy father , Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father , nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah ,
14:21:013:0	But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring , like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab , and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than thyself :
14:21:014:0	Behold , with a great plague will the smite thy people , and thy children , and thy wives , and all thy goods :
14:21:015:0	And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels , until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day .
14:21:016:0	Moreover the stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians , that were near the Ethiopians :
14:21:017:0	And they came up into Judah , and brake into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , save Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
14:21:018:0	And after all this the smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease .
14:21:019:0	And it came to pass , that in process of time , after the end of two years , his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness : so he died of sore diseases . And his people made no burning for him , like the burning of his fathers .
14:21:020:0	Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . Howbeit they buried him in the city of David , but not in the sepulchres of the kings .
