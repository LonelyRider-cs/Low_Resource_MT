14:19:001:0	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
14:19:002:0	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , Shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love them that hate the ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the .
14:19:003:0	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek God .
14:19:004:0	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem : and he went out again through the people from Beerâ€“sheba to mount Ephraim , and brought them back unto the God of their fathers .
14:19:005:0	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah , city by city ,
14:19:006:0	And said to the judges , Take heed what ye do : for ye judge not for man , but for the , who is with you in the judgment .
14:19:007:0	Wherefore now let the fear of the be upon you ; take heed and do it : for there is no iniquity with the our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of gifts .

14:19:011:0	And , behold , Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the ; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the ruler of the house of Judah , for all the king 's matters : also the Levites shall be officers before you . Deal courageously , and the shall be with the good .
