14:24:001:0	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem . His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beerâ€“sheba .
14:24:002:0	And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
14:24:003:0	And Jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he begat sons and daughters .
14:24:004:0	And it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord .
14:24:005:0	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to them , Go out unto the cities of Judah , and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year , and see that ye hasten the matter . Howbeit the Levites hastened it not .
14:24:006:0	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief , and said unto him , Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord , and of the congregation of Israel , for the tabernacle of witness ?
14:24:007:0	For the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim .
14:24:008:0	And at the king's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the Lord .
14:24:009:0	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
14:24:010:0	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
14:24:011:0	Now it came to pass , that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw that there was much money , the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest , and took it , and carried it to his place again . Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
14:24:012:0	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord .
14:24:013:0	So the workmen wrought , and the work was perfected by them , and they set the house of God in his state , and strengthened it .
14:24:014:0	And when they had finished it , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada , whereof were made vessels for the house of the Lord , even vessels to minister , and to offer withal , and spoons , and vessels of gold and silver . And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada .
14:24:015:0	But Jehoiada waxed old , and was full of days when he died ; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
14:24:016:0	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
14:24:017:0	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . Then the king hearkened unto them .
14:24:018:0	And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers , and served groves and idols : and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass .
14:24:019:0	Yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the Lord ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
14:24:020:0	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest , which stood above the people , and said unto them , Thus saith God , Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord , that ye cannot prosper ? because ye have forsaken the Lord , he hath also forsaken you .
14:24:021:0	And they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord .
14:24:022:0	Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . And when he died , he said , The Lord look upon it , and require it .
14:24:023:0	And it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus .
14:24:024:0	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men , and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand , because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers . So they executed judgment against Joash .
14:24:025:0	And when they were departed from him , ( for they left him in great diseases , ) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and slew him on his bed , and he died : and they buried him in the city of David , but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings .
14:24:026:0	And these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
14:24:027:0	Now concerning his sons , and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him , and the repairing of the house of God , behold , they are written in the story of the book of the kings . And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
