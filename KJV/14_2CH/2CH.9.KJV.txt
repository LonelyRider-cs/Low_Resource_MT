14:9:001:0	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon , she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem , with a very great company , and camels that bare spices , and gold in abundance , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
14:9:002:0	And Solomon told her all her questions : and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not .
14:9:003:0	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
14:9:004:0	And the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel ; his cupbearers also , and their apparel ; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the ; there was no more spirit in her .
14:9:005:0	And she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of thy wisdom :
14:9:006:0	Howbeit I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me : for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
14:9:007:0	Happy are thy men , and happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and hear thy wisdom .
14:9:008:0	Blessed be the thy God , which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne , to be king for the thy God : because thy God loved Israel , to establish them for ever , therefore made he thee king over them , to do judgment and justice .
14:9:009:0	And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon .
14:9:010:0	And the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , which brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
14:9:011:0	And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the , and to the king 's palace , and harps and psalteries for singers : and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah .
14:9:012:0	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which she had brought unto the king . So she turned , and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
14:9:013:0	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold ;
14:9:014:0	Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought . And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
14:9:015:0	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target .
14:9:016:0	And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield . And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
14:9:017:0	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
14:9:018:0	And there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two lions standing by the stays :
14:9:019:0	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . There was not the like made in any kingdom .
14:9:020:0	And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
14:9:021:0	For the king 's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram : every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold , and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
14:9:022:0	And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
14:9:023:0	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
14:9:024:0	And they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
14:9:025:0	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen ; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
14:9:026:0	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt .
14:9:027:0	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance .
14:9:028:0	And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
14:9:029:0	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
14:9:030:0	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years .
14:9:031:0	And Solomon slept with his fathers , and he was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
