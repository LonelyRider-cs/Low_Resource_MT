14:15:001:0	And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded :
14:15:002:0	And he went out to meet Asa , and said unto him , Hear ye me , Asa , and all Judah and Benjamin ; The is with you , while ye be with him ; and if ye seek him , he will be found of you ; but if ye forsake him , he will forsake you .
14:15:003:0	Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
14:15:004:0	But when they in their trouble did turn unto the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
14:15:005:0	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
14:15:006:0	And nation was destroyed of nation , and city of city : for God did vex them with all adversity .
14:15:007:0	Be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands be weak : for your work shall be rewarded .
14:15:008:0	And when Asa heard these words , and the prophecy of Oded the prophet , he took courage , and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin , and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim , and renewed the altar of the , that was before the porch of the .
14:15:009:0	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon : for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that the his God was with him .
14:15:010:0	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa .
14:15:011:0	And they offered unto the the same time , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep .
14:15:012:0	And they entered into a covenant to seek the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ;
14:15:013:0	That whosoever would not seek the God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
14:15:014:0	And they sware unto the with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
14:15:015:0	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the gave them rest round about .
14:15:016:0	And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king , he removed her from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove : and Asa cut down her idol , and stamped it , and burnt it at the brook Kidron .
14:15:017:0	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel : nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days .
14:15:018:0	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
14:15:019:0	And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa .
