14:1:001:0	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and the Lord his God was with him , and magnified him exceedingly .
14:1:002:0	Then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
14:1:003:0	So Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
14:1:004:0	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath–jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
14:1:005:0	Moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
14:1:006:0	And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord , which was at the tabernacle of the congregation , and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it .
14:1:007:0	In that night did God appear unto Solomon , and said unto him , Ask what I shall give thee .
14:1:008:0	And Solomon said unto God , Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father , and hast made me to reign in his stead .
14:1:009:0	Now , O Lord God , let thy promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
14:1:010:0	Give me now wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people : for who can judge this thy people , that is so great ?
14:1:011:0	And God said to Solomon , Because this was in thine heart , and thou hast not asked riches , wealth , or honour , nor the life of thine enemies , neither yet hast asked long life ; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself , that thou mayest judge my people , over whom I have made thee king :
14:1:012:0	Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
14:1:013:0	Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reigned over Israel .
14:1:014:0	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , which he placed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
14:1:015:0	And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance .
14:1:016:0	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
14:1:017:0	And they fetched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
