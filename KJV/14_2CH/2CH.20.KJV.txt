14:20:001:0	It came to pass after this also , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them other beside the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
14:20:002:0	Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat , saying , There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ; and , behold , they be in Hazazon–tamar , which is En–gedi .
14:20:003:0	And Jehoshaphat feared , and set himself to seek the , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
14:20:004:0	And Judah gathered themselves together , to ask help of the : even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the .
14:20:005:0	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the , before the new court ,
14:20:006:0	And said , O God of our fathers , art not thou God in heaven ? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen ? and in thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
14:20:007:0	Art not thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever ?
14:20:008:0	And they dwelt therein , and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name , saying ,
14:20:009:0	If , when evil cometh upon us , as the sword , judgment , or pestilence , or famine , we stand before this house , and in thy presence , ( for thy name is in this house , ) and cry unto thee in our affliction , then thou wilt hear and help .
14:20:010:0	And now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir , whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not ;
14:20:011:0	Behold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of thy possession , which thou hast given us to inherit .
14:20:012:0	O our God , wilt thou not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us ; neither know we what to do : but our eyes are upon thee .
14:20:013:0	And all Judah stood before the , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
14:20:014:0	Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the in the midst of the congregation ;
14:20:015:0	And he said , Hearken ye , all Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou king Jehoshaphat , Thus saith the unto you , Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
14:20:016:0	To morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the cliff of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
14:20:017:0	Ye shall not need to fight in this battle : set yourselves , stand ye still , and see the salvation of the with you , O Judah and Jerusalem : fear not , nor be dismayed ; to morrow go out against them : for the will be with you .
14:20:018:0	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the , worshipping the .
14:20:019:0	And the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the children of the Korhites , stood up to praise the God of Israel with a loud voice on high .
14:20:020:0	And they rose early in the morning , and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa : and as they went forth , Jehoshaphat stood and said , Hear me , O Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem ; Believe in the your God , so shall ye be established ; believe his prophets , so shall ye prosper .
14:20:021:0	And when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the , and that should praise the beauty of holiness , as they went out before the army , and to say , Praise the ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
14:20:022:0	And when they began to sing and to praise , the set ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which were come against Judah ; and they were smitten .
14:20:023:0	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .
14:20:024:0	And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
14:20:025:0	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them , they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies , and precious jewels , which they stripped off for themselves , more than they could carry away : and they were three days in gathering of the spoil , it was so much .
14:20:026:0	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
14:20:027:0	Then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
14:20:028:0	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the .
14:20:029:0	And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the fought against the enemies of Israel .
14:20:030:0	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet : for his God gave him rest round about .
14:20:031:0	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . And his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
14:20:032:0	And he walked in the way of Asa his father , and departed not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the .
14:20:033:0	Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
14:20:034:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
14:20:035:0	And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel , who did very wickedly :
14:20:036:0	And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish : and they made the ships in Ezion–geber .
14:20:037:0	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah , the hath broken thy works . And the ships were broken , that they were not able to go to Tarshish .
