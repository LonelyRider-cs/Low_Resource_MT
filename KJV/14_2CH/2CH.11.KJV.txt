14:11:001:0	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
14:11:002:0	But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
14:11:003:0	Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
14:11:004:0	Thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . And they obeyed the words of the Lord , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
14:11:005:0	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem , and built cities for defence in Judah .
14:11:006:0	He built even Beth–lehem , and Etam , and Tekoa ,
14:11:007:0	And Beth–zur , and Soco , and Adullam ,
14:11:008:0	And Gath , and Mareshah , and Ziph ,
14:11:009:0	And Adoraim , and Lachish , and Azekah ,
14:11:010:0	And Zorah , and Aijalon , and Hebron , which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities .
14:11:011:0	And he fortified the strong holds , and put captains in them , and store of victual , and of oil and wine .
14:11:012:0	And in every several city he put shields and spears , and made them exceeding strong , having Judah and Benjamin on his side .
14:11:013:0	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts .
14:11:014:0	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the Lord :
14:11:015:0	And he ordained him priests for the high places , and for the devils , and for the calves which he had made .
14:11:016:0	And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers .
14:11:017:0	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
14:11:018:0	And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife , and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ;
14:11:019:0	Which bare him children ; Jeush , and Shemariah , and Zaham .
14:11:020:0	And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom ; which bare him Abijah , and Attai , and Ziza , and Shelomith .
14:11:021:0	And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters . )
14:11:022:0	And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
14:11:023:0	And he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin , unto every fenced city : and he gave them victual in abundance . And he desired many wives .
