14:13:001:0	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah .
14:13:002:0	He reigned three years in Jerusalem . His mother 's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
14:13:003:0	And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , being mighty men of valour .
14:13:004:0	And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim , which is in mount Ephraim , and said , Hear me , thou Jeroboam , and all Israel ;
14:13:005:0	Ought ye not to know that the God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
14:13:006:0	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
14:13:007:0	And there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
14:13:008:0	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden calves , which Jeroboam made you for gods .
14:13:009:0	Have ye not cast out the priests of the , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands ? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams , the same may be a priest of them that are no gods .
14:13:010:0	But as for us , the is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests , which minister unto the , are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites wait upon their business :
14:13:011:0	And they burn unto the every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense : the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table ; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof , to burn every evening : for we keep the charge of the our God ; but ye have forsaken him .
14:13:012:0	And , behold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the God of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
14:13:013:0	But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them : so they were before Judah , and the ambushment was behind them .
14:13:014:0	And when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
14:13:015:0	Then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass , that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
14:13:016:0	And the children of Israel fled before Judah : and God delivered them into their hand .
14:13:017:0	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
14:13:018:0	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied upon the God of their fathers .
14:13:019:0	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethâ€“el with the towns thereof , and Jeshanah with the towns thereof , and Ephrain with the towns thereof .
14:13:020:0	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah : and the struck him , and he died .
14:13:021:0	But Abijah waxed mighty , and married fourteen wives , and begat twenty and two sons , and sixteen daughters .
14:13:022:0	And the rest of the acts of Abijah , and his ways , and his sayings , are written in the story of the prophet Iddo .
