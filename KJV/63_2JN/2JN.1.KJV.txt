63:1:001:0	The elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
63:1:002:0	For the truth's sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
63:1:003:0	Grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
63:1:004:0	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
63:1:005:0	And now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
63:1:006:0	And this is love , that we walk after his commandments . This is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
63:1:007:0	For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
63:1:008:0	Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
63:1:009:0	Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
63:1:010:0	If there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
63:1:011:0	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds .
63:1:012:0	Having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
63:1:013:0	The children of thy elect sister greet thee . Amen .
