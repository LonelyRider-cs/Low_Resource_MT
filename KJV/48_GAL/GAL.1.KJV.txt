48:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
48:1:002:0	And all the brethren which are with me , unto the churches of Galatia :
48:1:003:0	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48:1:004:0	Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father :
48:1:005:0	To whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
48:1:006:0	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
48:1:007:0	Which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
48:1:008:0	But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
48:1:009:0	As we said before , so say I now again , If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed .
48:1:010:0	For do I now persuade men , or God ? or do I seek to please men ? for if I yet pleased men , I should not be the servant of Christ .
48:1:011:0	But I certify you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man .
48:1:012:0	For I neither received it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
48:1:013:0	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
48:1:014:0	And profited in the Jews ' religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
48:1:015:0	But when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
48:1:016:0	To reveal his Son in me , that I might preach him among the heathen ; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood :
48:1:017:0	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me ; but I went into Arabia , and returned again unto Damascus .
48:1:018:0	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter , and abode with him fifteen days .
48:1:019:0	But other of the apostles saw I none , save James the Lord 's brother .
48:1:020:0	Now the things which I write unto you , behold , before God , I lie not .
48:1:021:0	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ;
48:1:022:0	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ :
48:1:023:0	But they had heard only , That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed .
48:1:024:0	And they glorified God in me .
