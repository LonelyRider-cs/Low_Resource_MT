48:5:001:0	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
48:5:002:0	Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
48:5:003:0	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
48:5:004:0	Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
48:5:005:0	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
48:5:006:0	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
48:5:007:0	Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
48:5:008:0	This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you .
48:5:009:0	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
48:5:010:0	I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
48:5:011:0	And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
48:5:012:0	I would they were even cut off which trouble you .
48:5:013:0	For , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
48:5:014:0	For all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
48:5:015:0	But if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
48:5:016:0	This I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
48:5:017:0	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye can not do the things that ye would .
48:5:018:0	But if ye be led of the Spirit , ye are not under the law .
48:5:019:0	Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; Adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
48:5:020:0	Idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies ,
48:5:021:0	Envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
48:5:022:0	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
48:5:023:0	Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .
48:5:024:0	And they that are Christ 's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts .
48:5:025:0	If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
48:5:026:0	Let us not be desirous of vain glory , provoking one another , envying one another .
