48:6:001:0	Brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an one in the spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou also be tempted .
48:6:002:0	Bear ye one another's burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ .
48:6:003:0	For if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
48:6:004:0	But let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
48:6:005:0	For every man shall bear his own burden .
48:6:006:0	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
48:6:007:0	Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
48:6:008:0	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting .
48:6:009:0	And let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
48:6:010:0	As we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
48:6:011:0	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
48:6:012:0	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
48:6:013:0	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
48:6:014:0	But God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
48:6:015:0	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
48:6:016:0	And as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
48:6:017:0	From henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
48:6:018:0	Brethren , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
