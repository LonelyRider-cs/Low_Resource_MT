48:2:001:0	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took Titus with me also .
48:2:002:0	And I went up by revelation , and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but privately to them which were of reputation , lest by any means I should run , or had run , in vain .
48:2:003:0	But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
48:2:004:0	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage :
48:2:005:0	To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
48:2:006:0	But of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
48:2:007:0	But contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ;
48:2:008:0	( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles : )
48:2:009:0	And when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
48:2:010:0	Only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
48:2:011:0	But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
48:2:012:0	For before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
48:2:013:0	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation .
48:2:014:0	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , I said unto Peter before them all , If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of Gentiles , and not as do the Jews , why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
48:2:015:0	We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
48:2:016:0	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
48:2:017:0	But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
48:2:018:0	For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
48:2:019:0	For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
48:2:020:0	I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
48:2:021:0	I do not frustrate the grace of God : for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain .
