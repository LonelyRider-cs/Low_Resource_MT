48:3:001:0	O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ?
48:3:002:0	This only would I learn of you , Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
48:3:003:0	Are ye so foolish ? having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
48:3:004:0	Have ye suffered so many things in vain ? if it be yet in vain .
48:3:005:0	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
48:3:006:0	Even as Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness .
48:3:007:0	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
48:3:008:0	And the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith , preached before the gospel unto Abraham , saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed .
48:3:009:0	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham .
48:3:010:0	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
48:3:011:0	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
48:3:012:0	And the law is not of faith : but , The man that doeth them shall live in them .
48:3:013:0	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
48:3:014:0	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
48:3:015:0	Brethren , I speak after the manner of men ; Though it be but a man 's covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto .
48:3:016:0	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .
48:3:017:0	And this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , can not disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
48:3:018:0	For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise .
48:3:019:0	Wherefore then serveth the law ? It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
48:3:020:0	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
48:3:021:0	Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
48:3:022:0	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
48:3:023:0	But before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
48:3:024:0	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
48:3:025:0	But after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
48:3:026:0	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus .
48:3:027:0	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
48:3:028:0	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
48:3:029:0	And if ye be Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
