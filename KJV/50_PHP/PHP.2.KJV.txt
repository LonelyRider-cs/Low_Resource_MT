50:2:001:0	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of the Spirit , if any bowels and mercies ,
50:2:002:0	Fulfil ye my joy , that ye be likeminded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind .
50:2:003:0	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
50:2:004:0	Look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
50:2:005:0	Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
50:2:006:0	Who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
50:2:007:0	But made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
50:2:008:0	And being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross .
50:2:009:0	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
50:2:010:0	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ;
50:2:011:0	And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50:2:012:0	Wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
50:2:013:0	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
50:2:014:0	Do all things without murmurings and disputings :
50:2:015:0	That ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
50:2:016:0	Holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
50:2:017:0	Yea , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and rejoice with you all .
50:2:018:0	For the same cause also do ye joy , and rejoice with me .
50:2:019:0	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
50:2:020:0	For I have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
50:2:021:0	For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ 's .
50:2:022:0	But ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
50:2:023:0	Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
50:2:024:0	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
50:2:025:0	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
50:2:026:0	For he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
50:2:027:0	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
50:2:028:0	I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
50:2:029:0	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
50:2:030:0	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
