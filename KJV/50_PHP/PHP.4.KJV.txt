50:4:001:0	Therefore , my brethren dearly beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand fast in the Lord , my dearly beloved .
50:4:002:0	I beseech Euodias , and beseech Syntyche , that they be of the same mind in the Lord .
50:4:003:0	And I entreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
50:4:004:0	Rejoice in the Lord alway : and again I say , Rejoice .
50:4:005:0	Let your moderation be known unto all men . The Lord is at hand .
50:4:006:0	Be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God .
50:4:007:0	And the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus .
50:4:008:0	Finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
50:4:009:0	Those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
50:4:010:0	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
50:4:011:0	Not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
50:4:012:0	I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
50:4:013:0	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .
50:4:014:0	Notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
50:4:015:0	Now ye Philippians know also , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
50:4:016:0	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity .
50:4:017:0	Not because I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that may abound to your account .
50:4:018:0	But I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
50:4:019:0	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus .
50:4:020:0	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
50:4:021:0	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren which are with me greet you .
50:4:022:0	All the saints salute you , chiefly they that are of Caesar's household .
50:4:023:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
