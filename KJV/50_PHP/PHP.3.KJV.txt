50:3:001:0	Finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
50:3:002:0	Beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the concision .
50:3:003:0	For we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
50:3:004:0	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh . If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
50:3:005:0	Circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , an Hebrew of the Hebrews ; as touching the law , a Pharisee ;
50:3:006:0	Concerning zeal , persecuting the church ; touching the righteousness which is in the law , blameless .
50:3:007:0	But what things were gain to me , those I counted loss for Christ .
50:3:008:0	Yea doubtless , and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord : for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and do count them but dung , that I may win Christ ,
50:3:009:0	And be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
50:3:010:0	That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
50:3:011:0	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead .
50:3:012:0	Not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
50:3:013:0	Brethren , I count not myself to have apprehended : but this one thing I do , forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before ,
50:3:014:0	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
50:3:015:0	Let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
50:3:016:0	Nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
50:3:017:0	Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example .
50:3:018:0	( For many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
50:3:019:0	Whose end is destruction , whose god is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things . )
50:3:020:0	For our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ :
50:3:021:0	Who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
