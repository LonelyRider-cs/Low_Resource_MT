50:1:001:0	Paul and Timothy , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
50:1:002:0	Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
50:1:003:0	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you ,
50:1:004:0	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy ,
50:1:005:0	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now ;
50:1:006:0	Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
50:1:007:0	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
50:1:008:0	For God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
50:1:009:0	And this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment ;
50:1:010:0	That ye may approve things that are excellent ; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ ;
50:1:011:0	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are by Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
50:1:012:0	But I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
50:1:013:0	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ;
50:1:014:0	And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
50:1:015:0	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife ; and some also of good will :
50:1:016:0	The one preach Christ of contention , not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds :
50:1:017:0	But the other of love , knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel .
50:1:018:0	What then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
50:1:019:0	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
50:1:020:0	According to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
50:1:021:0	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
50:1:022:0	But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
50:1:023:0	For I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
50:1:024:0	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
50:1:025:0	And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
50:1:026:0	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again .
50:1:027:0	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
50:1:028:0	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
50:1:029:0	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ;
50:1:030:0	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
