9:2:001:0	And Hannah prayed , and said , My heart rejoiceth in the Lord , mine horn is exalted in the Lord : my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies ; because I rejoice in thy salvation .
9:2:002:0	There is none holy as the Lord : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like our God .
9:2:003:0	Talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
9:2:004:0	The bows of the mighty men are broken , and they that stumbled are girded with strength .
9:2:005:0	They that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hungry ceased : so that the barren hath born seven ; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
9:2:006:0	The Lord killeth , and maketh alive : he bringeth down to the grave , and bringeth up .
9:2:007:0	The Lord maketh poor , and maketh rich : he bringeth low , and lifteth up .
9:2:008:0	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill , to set them among princes , and to make them inherit the throne of glory : for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's , and he hath set the world upon them .
9:2:009:0	He will keep the feet of his saints , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
9:2:010:0	The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them : the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto his king , and exalt the horn of his anointed .
9:2:011:0	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house . And the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest .
9:2:012:0	Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial ; they knew not the Lord .
9:2:013:0	And the priests' custom with the people was , that , when any man offered sacrifice , the priest's servant came , while the flesh was in seething , with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand ;
9:2:014:0	And he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself . So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither .
9:2:015:0	Also before they burnt the fat , the priest's servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
9:2:016:0	And if any man said unto him , Let them not fail to burn the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soul desireth ; then he would answer him , Nay ; but thou shalt give it me now : and if not , I will take it by force .
9:2:017:0	Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord : for men abhorred the offering of the Lord .
9:2:018:0	But Samuel ministered before the Lord , being a child , girded with a linen ephod .
9:2:019:0	Moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
9:2:020:0	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , and said , The Lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord . And they went unto their own home .
9:2:021:0	And the Lord visited Hannah , so that she conceived , and bare three sons and two daughters . And the child Samuel grew before the Lord .
9:2:022:0	Now Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
9:2:023:0	And he said unto them , Why do ye such things ? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people .
9:2:024:0	Nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the Lord's people to transgress .
9:2:025:0	If one man sin against another , the judge shall judge him : but if a man sin against the Lord , who shall entreat for him ? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father , because the Lord would slay them .
9:2:026:0	And the child Samuel grew on , and was in favour both with the Lord , and also with men .
9:2:027:0	And there came a man of God unto Eli , and said unto him , Thus saith the Lord , Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father , when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house ?
9:2:028:0	And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to offer upon mine altar , to burn incense , to wear an ephod before me ? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel ?
9:2:029:0	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering , which I have commanded in my habitation ; and honourest thy sons above me , to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people ?
9:2:030:0	Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith , I said indeed that thy house , and the house of thy father , should walk before me for ever : but now the Lord saith , Be it far from me ; for them that honour me I will honour , and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed .
9:2:031:0	Behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
9:2:032:0	And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
9:2:033:0	And the man of thine , whom I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eyes , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age .
9:2:034:0	And this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them .
9:2:035:0	And I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
9:2:036:0	And it shall come to pass , that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread , and shall say , Put me , I pray thee , into one of the priests' offices , that I may eat a piece of bread .
