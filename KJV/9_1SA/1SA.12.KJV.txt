9:12:001:0	And Samuel said unto all Israel , Behold , I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me , and have made a king over you .
9:12:002:0	And now , behold , the king walketh before you : and I am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
9:12:003:0	Behold , here I am : witness against me before the Lord , and before his anointed : whose ox have I taken ? or whose ass have I taken ? or whom have I defrauded ? whom have I oppressed ? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith ? and I will restore it you .
9:12:004:0	And they said , Thou hast not defrauded us , nor oppressed us , neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand .
9:12:005:0	And he said unto them , The Lord is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . And they answered , He is witness .
9:12:006:0	And Samuel said unto the people , It is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
9:12:007:0	Now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and to your fathers .
9:12:008:0	When Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
9:12:009:0	And when they forgat the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
9:12:010:0	And they cried unto the Lord , and said , We have sinned , because we have forsaken the Lord , and have served Baalim and Ashtoreth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
9:12:011:0	And the Lord sent Jerubbaal , and Bedan , and Jephthah , and Samuel , and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side , and ye dwelled safe .
9:12:012:0	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , ye said unto me , Nay ; but a king shall reign over us : when the Lord your God was your king .
9:12:013:0	Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the Lord hath set a king over you .
9:12:014:0	If ye will fear the Lord , and serve him , and obey his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God :
9:12:015:0	But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
9:12:016:0	Now therefore stand and see this great thing , which the Lord will do before your eyes .
9:12:017:0	Is it not wheat harvest to day ? I will call unto the Lord , and he shall send thunder and rain ; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great , which ye have done in the sight of the Lord , in asking you a king .
9:12:018:0	So Samuel called unto the Lord ; and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
9:12:019:0	And all the people said unto Samuel , Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
9:12:020:0	And Samuel said unto the people , Fear not : ye have done all this wickedness : yet turn not aside from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart ;
9:12:021:0	And turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which cannot profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
9:12:022:0	For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake : because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people .
9:12:023:0	Moreover as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you : but I will teach you the good and the right way :
9:12:024:0	Only fear the Lord , and serve him in truth with all your heart : for consider how great things he hath done for you .
9:12:025:0	But if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consumed , both ye and your king .
