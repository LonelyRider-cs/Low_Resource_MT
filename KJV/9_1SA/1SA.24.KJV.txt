9:24:001:0	And it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , Behold , David is in the wilderness of Enâ€“gedi .
9:24:002:0	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats .
9:24:003:0	And he came to the sheepcotes by the way , where was a cave ; and Saul went in to cover his feet : and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
9:24:004:0	And the men of David said unto him , Behold the day of which the said unto thee , Behold , I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand , that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee . Then David arose , and cut off the skirt of Saul 's robe privily .
9:24:005:0	And it came to pass afterward , that David 's heart smote him , because he had cut off Saul 's skirt .
9:24:006:0	And he said unto his men , The forbid that I should do this thing unto my master , the anointed , to stretch forth mine hand against him , seeing he is the anointed of the .
9:24:007:0	So David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . But Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
9:24:008:0	David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , My lord the king . And when Saul looked behind him , David stooped with his face to the earth , and bowed himself .
9:24:009:0	And David said to Saul , Wherefore hearest thou men 's words , saying , Behold , David seeketh thy hurt ?
9:24:010:0	Behold , this day thine eyes have seen how that the had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave : and some bade me kill thee : but mine eye spared thee ; and I said , I will not put forth mine hand against my lord ; for he is the anointed .
9:24:011:0	Moreover , my father , see , yea , see the skirt of thy robe in my hand : for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe , and killed thee not , know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand , and I have not sinned against thee ; yet thou huntest my soul to take it .
9:24:012:0	The judge between me and thee , and the avenge me of thee : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
9:24:013:0	As saith the proverb of the ancients , Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
9:24:014:0	After whom is the king of Israel come out ? after whom dost thou pursue ? after a dead dog , after a flea .
9:24:015:0	The therefore be judge , and judge between me and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver me out of thine hand .
9:24:016:0	And it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul , that Saul said , Is this thy voice , my son David ? And Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
9:24:017:0	And he said to David , Thou art more righteous than I : for thou hast rewarded me good , whereas I have rewarded thee evil .
9:24:018:0	And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
9:24:019:0	For if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? wherefore the reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day .
9:24:020:0	And now , behold , I know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand .
9:24:021:0	Swear now therefore unto me by the , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
9:24:022:0	And David sware unto Saul . And Saul went home ; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold .
