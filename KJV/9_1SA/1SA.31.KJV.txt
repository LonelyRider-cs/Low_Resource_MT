9:31:001:0	Now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
9:31:002:0	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi–shua , Saul's sons .
9:31:003:0	And the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of the archers .
9:31:004:0	Then said Saul unto his armourbearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through , and abuse me . But his armourbearer would not ; for he was sore afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
9:31:005:0	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise upon his sword , and died with him .
9:31:006:0	So Saul died , and his three sons , and his armourbearer , and all his men , that same day together .
9:31:007:0	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley , and they that were on the other side Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
9:31:008:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
9:31:009:0	And they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
9:31:010:0	And they put his armour in the house of Ashtoreth : and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth–shan .
9:31:011:0	And when the inhabitants of Jabesh–gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul ;
9:31:012:0	All the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth–shan , and came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
9:31:013:0	And they took their bones , and buried them under a tree at Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
