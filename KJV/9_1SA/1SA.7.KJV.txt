9:7:001:0	And the men of Kirjath–jearim came , and fetched up the ark of the Lord , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord .
9:7:002:0	And it came to pass , while the ark abode in Kirjath–jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord .
9:7:003:0	And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel , saying , If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts , then put away the strange gods and Ashtoreth from among you , and prepare your hearts unto the Lord , and serve him only : and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines .
9:7:004:0	Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtoreth , and served the Lord only .
9:7:005:0	And Samuel said , Gather all Israel to Mizpah , and I will pray for you unto the Lord .
9:7:006:0	And they gathered together to Mizpah , and drew water , and poured it out before the Lord , and fasted on that day , and said there , We have sinned against the Lord . And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah .
9:7:007:0	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . And when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
9:7:008:0	And the children of Israel said to Samuel , Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
9:7:009:0	And Samuel took a sucking lamb , and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord : and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel ; and the Lord heard him .
9:7:010:0	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel : but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were smitten before Israel .
9:7:011:0	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and smote them , until they came under Beth–car .
9:7:012:0	Then Samuel took a stone , and set it between Mizpah and Shen , and called the name of it Eben–ezer , saying , Hitherto hath the Lord helped us .
9:7:013:0	So the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
9:7:014:0	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even unto Gath ; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .
9:7:015:0	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
9:7:016:0	And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth–el , and Gilgal , and Mizpah , and judged Israel in all those places .
9:7:017:0	And his return was to Ramah ; for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel ; and there he built an altar unto the Lord .
