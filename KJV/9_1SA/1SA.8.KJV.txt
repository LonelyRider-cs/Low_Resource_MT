9:8:001:0	And it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
9:8:002:0	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abiah : they were judges in Beerâ€“sheba .
9:8:003:0	And his sons walked not in his ways , but turned aside after lucre , and took bribes , and perverted judgment .
9:8:004:0	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together , and came to Samuel unto Ramah ,
9:8:005:0	And said unto him , Behold , thou art old , and thy sons walk not in thy ways : now make us a king to judge us like all the nations .
9:8:006:0	But the thing displeased Samuel , when they said , Give us a king to judge us . And Samuel prayed unto the .
9:8:007:0	And the said unto Samuel , Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
9:8:008:0	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
9:8:009:0	Now therefore hearken unto their voice : howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them , and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
9:8:010:0	And Samuel told all the words of the unto the people that asked of him a king .
9:8:011:0	And he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : He will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
9:8:012:0	And he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
9:8:013:0	And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries , and to be cooks , and to be bakers .
9:8:014:0	And he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
9:8:015:0	And he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
9:8:016:0	And he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
9:8:017:0	He will take the tenth of your sheep : and ye shall be his servants .
9:8:018:0	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the will not hear you in that day .
9:8:019:0	Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel ; and they said , Nay ; but we will have a king over us ;
9:8:020:0	That we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles .
9:8:021:0	And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of the .
9:8:022:0	And the said to Samuel , Hearken unto their voice , and make them a king . And Samuel said unto the men of Israel , Go ye every man unto his city .
