9:3:001:0	And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli . And the word of the Lord was precious in those days ; there was no open vision .
9:3:002:0	And it came to pass at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim , that he could not see ;
9:3:003:0	And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord , where the ark of God was , and Samuel was laid down to sleep ;
9:3:004:0	That the Lord called Samuel : and he answered , Here am I .
9:3:005:0	And he ran unto Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou calledst me . And he said , I called not ; lie down again . And he went and lay down .
9:3:006:0	And the Lord called yet again , Samuel . And Samuel arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me . And he answered , I called not , my son ; lie down again .
9:3:007:0	Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him .
9:3:008:0	And the Lord called Samuel again the third time . And he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me . And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child .
9:3:009:0	Therefore Eli said unto Samuel , Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speak , Lord ; for thy servant heareth . So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
9:3:010:0	And the Lord came , and stood , and called as at other times , Samuel , Samuel . Then Samuel answered , Speak ; for thy servant heareth .
9:3:011:0	And the Lord said to Samuel , Behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
9:3:012:0	In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
9:3:013:0	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not .
9:3:014:0	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
9:3:015:0	And Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the Lord . And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision .
9:3:016:0	Then Eli called Samuel , and said , Samuel , my son . And he answered , Here am I .
9:3:017:0	And he said , What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee ? I pray thee hide it not from me : God do so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee .
9:3:018:0	And Samuel told him every whit , and hid nothing from him . And he said , It is the Lord : let him do what seemeth him good .
9:3:019:0	And Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him , and did let none of his words fall to the ground .
9:3:020:0	And all Israel from Dan even to Beerâ€“sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord .
9:3:021:0	And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh : for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord .
