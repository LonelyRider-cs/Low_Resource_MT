9:11:001:0	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up , and encamped against Jabesh–gilead : and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash , Make a covenant with us , and we will serve thee .
9:11:002:0	And Nahash the Ammonite answered them , On this condition will I make a covenant with you , that I may thrust out all your right eyes , and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel .
9:11:003:0	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him , Give us seven days ' respite , that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel : and then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee .
9:11:004:0	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul , and told the tidings in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and wept .
9:11:005:0	And , behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field ; and Saul said , What aileth the people that they weep ? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh .
9:11:006:0	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings , and his anger was kindled greatly .
9:11:007:0	And he took a yoke of oxen , and hewed them in pieces , and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers , saying , Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel , so shall it be done unto his oxen . And the fear of the fell on the people , and they came out with one consent .
9:11:008:0	And when he numbered them in Bezek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
9:11:009:0	And they said unto the messengers that came , Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh–gilead , To morrow , by that time the sun be hot , ye shall have help . And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh ; and they were glad .
9:11:010:0	Therefore the men of Jabesh said , To morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you .
9:11:011:0	And it was so on the morrow , that Saul put the people in three companies ; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch , and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day : and it came to pass , that they which remained were scattered , so that two of them were not left together .
9:11:012:0	And the people said unto Samuel , Who is he that said , Shall Saul reign over us ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
9:11:013:0	And Saul said , There shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the hath wrought salvation in Israel .
9:11:014:0	Then said Samuel to the people , Come , and let us go to Gilgal , and renew the kingdom there .
9:11:015:0	And all the people went to Gilgal ; and there they made Saul king before the in Gilgal ; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly .
