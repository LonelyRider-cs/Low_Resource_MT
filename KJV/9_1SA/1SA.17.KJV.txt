9:17:001:0	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Soco , which belongeth to Judah , and pitched between Soco and Azekah , in Ephes–dammim .
9:17:002:0	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
9:17:003:0	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
9:17:004:0	And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
9:17:005:0	And he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
9:17:006:0	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
9:17:007:0	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
9:17:008:0	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel , and said unto them , Why are ye come out to set your battle in array ? am not I a Philistine , and ye servants to Saul ? choose you a man for you , and let him come down to me .
9:17:009:0	If he be able to fight with me , and to kill me , then will we be your servants : but if I prevail against him , and kill him , then shall ye be our servants , and serve us .
9:17:010:0	And the Philistine said , I defy the armies of Israel this day ; give me a man , that we may fight together .
9:17:011:0	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine , they were dismayed , and greatly afraid .
9:17:012:0	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth–lehem–judah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul .
9:17:013:0	And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
9:17:014:0	And David was the youngest : and the three eldest followed Saul .
9:17:015:0	But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father 's sheep at Beth–lehem .
9:17:016:0	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening , and presented himself forty days .
9:17:017:0	And Jesse said unto David his son , Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaves , and run to the camp to thy brethren ;
9:17:018:0	And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge .
9:17:019:0	Now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
9:17:020:0	And David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the trench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battle .
9:17:021:0	For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array , army against army .
9:17:022:0	And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
9:17:023:0	And as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the armies of the Philistines , and spake according to the same words : and David heard them .
9:17:024:0	And all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sore afraid .
9:17:025:0	And the men of Israel said , Have ye seen this man that is come up ? surely to defy Israel is he come up : and it shall be , that the man who killeth him , the king will enrich him with great riches , and will give him his daughter , and make his father 's house free in Israel .
9:17:026:0	And David spake to the men that stood by him , saying , What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine , and taketh away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
9:17:027:0	And the people answered him after this manner , saying , So shall it be done to the man that killeth him .
9:17:028:0	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men ; and Eliab 's anger was kindled against David , and he said , Why camest thou down hither ? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness ? I know thy pride , and the naughtiness of thine heart ; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle .
9:17:029:0	And David said , What have I now done ? Is there not a cause ?
9:17:030:0	And he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
9:17:031:0	And when the words were heard which David spake , they rehearsed them before Saul : and he sent for him .
9:17:032:0	And David said to Saul , Let no man 's heart fail because of him ; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine .
9:17:033:0	And Saul said to David , Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
9:17:034:0	And David said unto Saul , Thy servant kept his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
9:17:035:0	And I went out after him , and smote him , and delivered it out of his mouth : and when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard , and smote him , and slew him .
9:17:036:0	Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear : and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God .
9:17:037:0	David said moreover , The that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . And Saul said unto David , Go , and the be with thee .
9:17:038:0	And Saul armed David with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
9:17:039:0	And David girded his sword upon his armour , and he assayed to go ; for he had not proved it . And David said unto Saul , I can not go with these ; for I have not proved them . And David put them off him .
9:17:040:0	And he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook , and put them in a shepherd 's bag which he had , even in a scrip ; and his sling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Philistine .
9:17:041:0	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
9:17:042:0	And when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
9:17:043:0	And the Philistine said unto David , Am I a dog , that thou comest to me with staves ? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods .
9:17:044:0	And the Philistine said to David , Come to me , and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air , and to the beasts of the field .
9:17:045:0	Then said David to the Philistine , Thou comest to me with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield : but I come to thee in the name of the of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied .
9:17:046:0	This day will the deliver thee into mine hand ; and I will smite thee , and take thine head from thee ; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air , and to the wild beasts of the earth ; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel .
9:17:047:0	And all this assembly shall know that the saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle is the , and he will give you into our hands .
9:17:048:0	And it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew nigh to meet David , that David hasted , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
9:17:049:0	And David put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
9:17:050:0	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
9:17:051:0	Therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
9:17:052:0	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until thou come to the valley , and to the gates of Ekron . And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim , even unto Gath , and unto Ekron .
9:17:053:0	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they spoiled their tents .
9:17:054:0	And David took the head of the Philistine , and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his armour in his tent .
9:17:055:0	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine , he said unto Abner , the captain of the host , Abner , whose son is this youth ? And Abner said , As thy soul liveth , O king , I can not tell .
9:17:056:0	And the king said , Enquire thou whose son the stripling is .
9:17:057:0	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
9:17:058:0	And Saul said to him , Whose son art thou , thou young man ? And David answered , I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth–lehemite .
