16:12:022:0	The Levites in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , were recorded chief of the fathers : also the priests , to the reign of Darius the Persian .
16:12:023:0	The sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
16:12:024:0	And the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
16:12:025:0	Mattaniah , and Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , Akkub , were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates .
16:12:026:0	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest , the scribe .
16:12:027:0	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem , to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgivings , and with singing , with cymbals , psalteries , and with harps .
16:12:028:0	And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem , and from the villages of Netophathi ;
16:12:029:0	Also from the house of Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth : for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem .
16:12:030:0	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves , and purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
16:12:031:0	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate :
16:12:032:0	And after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah ,
16:12:033:0	And Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam ,
16:12:034:0	Judah , and Benjamin , and Shemaiah , and Jeremiah ,
16:12:035:0	And certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph :
16:12:036:0	And his brethren , Shemaiah , and Azarael , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and Ezra the scribe before them .
16:12:037:0	And at the fountain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even unto the water gate eastward .
16:12:038:0	And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them , and I after them , and the half of the people upon the wall , from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall ;
16:12:039:0	And from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
16:12:040:0	So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God , and I , and the half of the rulers with me :
16:12:041:0	And the priests ; Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Michaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah , with trumpets ;
16:12:042:0	And Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . And the singers sang loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
16:12:043:0	Also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced : for God had made them rejoice with great joy : the wives also and the children rejoiced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
16:12:044:0	And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures , for the offerings , for the firstfruits , and for the tithes , to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites : for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited .
16:12:045:0	And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God , and the ward of the purification , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
16:12:046:0	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God .
16:12:047:0	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel , and in the days of Nehemiah , gave the portions of the singers and the porters , every day his portion : and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites ; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron .
