16:7:001:0	Now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
16:7:002:0	That I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
16:7:003:0	And I said unto them , Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot ; and while they stand by , let them shut the doors , and bar them : and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , every one in his watch , and every one to be over against his house .
16:7:004:0	Now the city was large and great : but the people were few therein , and the houses were not builded .
16:7:005:0	And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles , and the rulers , and the people , that they might be reckoned by genealogy . And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first , and found written therein ,
16:7:006:0	These are the children of the province , that went up out of the captivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah , every one unto his city ;

16:7:063:0	And of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
16:7:064:0	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but it was not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
16:7:065:0	And the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
16:7:066:0	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
