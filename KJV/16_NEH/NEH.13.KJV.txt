16:13:001:0	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
16:13:002:0	Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing .
16:13:003:0	Now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
16:13:004:0	And before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah :
16:13:005:0	And he had prepared for him a great chamber , where aforetime they laid the meat offerings , the frankincense , and the vessels , and the tithes of the corn , the new wine , and the oil , which was commanded to be given to the Levites , and the singers , and the porters ; and the offerings of the priests .
16:13:006:0	But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem : for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
16:13:007:0	And I came to Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
16:13:008:0	And it grieved me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber .
16:13:009:0	Then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
16:13:010:0	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
16:13:011:0	Then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ? And I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
16:13:012:0	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries .
16:13:013:0	And I made treasurers over the treasuries , Shelemiah the priest , and Zadok the scribe , and of the Levites , Pedaiah : and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur , the son of Mattaniah : for they were counted faithful , and their office was to distribute unto their brethren .
16:13:014:0	Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
16:13:015:0	In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath , and bringing in sheaves , and lading asses ; as also wine , grapes , and figs , and all manner of burdens , which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day : and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals .
16:13:016:0	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
16:13:017:0	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
16:13:018:0	Did not your fathers thus , and did not our God bring all this evil upon us , and upon this city ? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath .
16:13:019:0	And it came to pass , that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath , I commanded that the gates should be shut , and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath : and some of my servants set I at the gates , that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day .
16:13:020:0	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice .
16:13:021:0	Then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
16:13:022:0	And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath day . Remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy .
16:13:023:0	In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab :
16:13:024:0	And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews' language , but according to the language of each people .
16:13:025:0	And I contended with them , and cursed them , and smote certain of them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , saying , Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons , nor take their daughters unto your sons , or for yourselves .
16:13:026:0	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ? yet among many nations was there no king like him , who was beloved of his God , and God made him king over all Israel : nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin .
16:13:027:0	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil , to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives ?
16:13:028:0	And one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
16:13:029:0	Remember them , O my God , because they have defiled the priesthood , and the covenant of the priesthood , and of the Levites .
16:13:030:0	Thus cleansed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites , every one in his business ;
16:13:031:0	And for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the firstfruits . Remember me , O my God , for good .
