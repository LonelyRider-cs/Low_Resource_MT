51:3:001:0	If ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
51:3:002:0	Set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
51:3:003:0	For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
51:3:004:0	When Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
51:3:005:0	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry :
51:3:006:0	For which things ' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience :
51:3:007:0	In the which ye also walked some time , when ye lived in them .
51:3:008:0	But now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
51:3:009:0	Lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ;
51:3:010:0	And have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him :
51:3:011:0	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free : but Christ is all , and in all .
51:3:012:0	Put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ;
51:3:013:0	Forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
51:3:014:0	And above all these things put on charity , which is the bond of perfectness .
51:3:015:0	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
51:3:016:0	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
51:3:017:0	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
51:3:018:0	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
51:3:019:0	Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
51:3:020:0	Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .
51:3:021:0	Fathers , provoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
51:3:022:0	Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but in singleness of heart , fearing God :
51:3:023:0	And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ;
51:3:024:0	Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance : for ye serve the Lord Christ .
51:3:025:0	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
