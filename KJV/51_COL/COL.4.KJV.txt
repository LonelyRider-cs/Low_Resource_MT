51:4:001:0	Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven .
51:4:002:0	Continue in prayer , and watch in the same with thanksgiving ;
51:4:003:0	Withal praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
51:4:004:0	That I may make it manifest , as I ought to speak .
51:4:005:0	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
51:4:006:0	Let your speech be always with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
51:4:007:0	All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord :
51:4:008:0	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ;
51:4:009:0	With Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
51:4:010:0	Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and Mark , sister 's son to Barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ; )
51:4:011:0	And Jesus , which is called Justus , who are of the circumcision . These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God , which have been a comfort unto me .
51:4:012:0	Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , saluteth you , always labouring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
51:4:013:0	For I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
51:4:014:0	Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you .
51:4:015:0	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church which is in his house .
51:4:016:0	And when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
51:4:017:0	And say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfil it .
51:4:018:0	The salutation by the hand of me Paul . Remember my bonds . Grace be with you . Amen .
