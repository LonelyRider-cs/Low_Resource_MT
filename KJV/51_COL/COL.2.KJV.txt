51:2:001:0	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
51:2:002:0	That their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in love , and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God , and of the Father , and of Christ ;
51:2:003:0	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51:2:004:0	And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
51:2:005:0	For though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
51:2:006:0	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk ye in him :
51:2:007:0	Rooted and built up in him , and stablished in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving .
51:2:008:0	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ .
51:2:009:0	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily .
51:2:010:0	And ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principality and power :
51:2:011:0	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ :
51:2:012:0	Buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
51:2:013:0	And you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ;
51:2:014:0	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
51:2:015:0	And having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
51:2:016:0	Let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
51:2:017:0	Which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body is of Christ .
51:2:018:0	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
51:2:019:0	And not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God .
51:2:020:0	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to ordinances ,
51:2:021:0	( Touch not ; taste not ; handle not ;
51:2:022:0	Which all are to perish with the using ; ) after the commandments and doctrines of men ?
51:2:023:0	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body ; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh .
