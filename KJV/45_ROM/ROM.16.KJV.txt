45:16:001:0	I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea :
45:16:002:0	That ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
45:16:003:0	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus :
45:16:004:0	Who have for my life laid down their own necks : unto whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles .
45:16:005:0	Likewise greet the church that is in their house . Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus , who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Christ .
45:16:006:0	Greet Mary , who bestowed much labour on us .
45:16:007:0	Salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen , and my fellowprisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
45:16:008:0	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord .
45:16:009:0	Salute Urbane , our helper in Christ , and Stachys my beloved .
45:16:010:0	Salute Apelles approved in Christ . Salute them which are of Aristobulus ' household .
45:16:011:0	Salute Herodion my kinsman . Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus , which are in the Lord .
45:16:012:0	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa , who labour in the Lord . Salute the beloved Persis , which laboured much in the Lord .
45:16:013:0	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .

45:16:016:0	Salute one another with an holy kiss . The churches of Christ salute you .
45:16:017:0	Now I beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
45:16:018:0	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
45:16:019:0	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
45:16:020:0	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
45:16:021:0	Timothy my workfellow , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
45:16:022:0	I Tertius , who wrote this epistle , salute you in the Lord .
45:16:023:0	Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
45:16:024:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
45:16:025:0	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
45:16:026:0	But now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
45:16:027:0	To God only wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for ever . Amen .
