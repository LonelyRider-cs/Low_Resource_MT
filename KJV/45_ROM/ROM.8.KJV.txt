45:8:001:0	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
45:8:002:0	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
45:8:003:0	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
45:8:004:0	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
45:8:005:0	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
45:8:006:0	For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
45:8:007:0	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
45:8:008:0	So then they that are in the flesh can not please God .
45:8:009:0	But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
45:8:010:0	And if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
45:8:011:0	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
45:8:012:0	Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
45:8:013:0	For if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
45:8:014:0	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
45:8:015:0	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father .
45:8:016:0	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God :
45:8:017:0	And if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
45:8:018:0	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
45:8:019:0	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
45:8:020:0	For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
45:8:021:0	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
45:8:022:0	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
45:8:023:0	And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
45:8:024:0	For we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
45:8:025:0	But if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
45:8:026:0	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered .
45:8:027:0	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit , because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God .
45:8:028:0	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
45:8:029:0	For whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
45:8:030:0	Moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
45:8:031:0	What shall we then say to these things ? If God be for us , who can be against us ?
45:8:032:0	He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
45:8:033:0	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God 's elect ? It is God that justifieth .
45:8:034:0	Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
45:8:035:0	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
45:8:036:0	As it is written , For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
45:8:037:0	Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
45:8:038:0	For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
45:8:039:0	Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
