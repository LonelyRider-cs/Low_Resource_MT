45:6:001:0	What shall we say then ? Shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
45:6:002:0	God forbid . How shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
45:6:003:0	Know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ?
45:6:004:0	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
45:6:005:0	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
45:6:006:0	Knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
45:6:007:0	For he that is dead is freed from sin .
45:6:008:0	Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him :
45:6:009:0	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him .
45:6:010:0	For in that he died , he died unto sin once : but in that he liveth , he liveth unto God .
45:6:011:0	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45:6:012:0	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
45:6:013:0	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
45:6:014:0	For sin shall not have dominion over you : for ye are not under the law , but under grace .
45:6:015:0	What then ? shall we sin , because we are not under the law , but under grace ? God forbid .
45:6:016:0	Know ye not , that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey , his servants ye are to whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
45:6:017:0	But God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
45:6:018:0	Being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
45:6:019:0	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh : for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity ; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness .
45:6:020:0	For when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
45:6:021:0	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
45:6:022:0	But now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end everlasting life .
45:6:023:0	For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
