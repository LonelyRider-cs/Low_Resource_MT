45:15:001:0	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
45:15:002:0	Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
45:15:003:0	For even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
45:15:004:0	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
45:15:005:0	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus :
45:15:006:0	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45:15:007:0	Wherefore receive ye one another , as Christ also received us to the glory of God .
45:15:008:0	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
45:15:009:0	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy ; as it is written , For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles , and sing unto thy name .
45:15:010:0	And again he saith , Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with his people .
45:15:011:0	And again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and laud him , all ye people .
45:15:012:0	And again , Esaias saith , There shall be a root of Jesse , and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles ; in him shall the Gentiles trust .
45:15:013:0	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
45:15:014:0	And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
45:15:015:0	Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
45:15:016:0	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
45:15:017:0	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God .
45:15:018:0	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
45:15:019:0	Through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God ; so that from Jerusalem , and round about unto Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
45:15:020:0	Yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man's foundation :
45:15:021:0	But as it is written , To whom he was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that have not heard shall understand .
45:15:022:0	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you .
45:15:023:0	But now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ;
45:15:024:0	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
45:15:025:0	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints .
45:15:026:0	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem .
45:15:027:0	It hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
45:15:028:0	When therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
45:15:029:0	And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
45:15:030:0	Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
45:15:031:0	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ;
45:15:032:0	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
45:15:033:0	Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
