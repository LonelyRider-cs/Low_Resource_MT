45:12:001:0	I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
45:12:002:0	And be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
45:12:003:0	For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
45:12:004:0	For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
45:12:005:0	So we , being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
45:12:006:0	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
45:12:007:0	Or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
45:12:008:0	Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
45:12:009:0	Let love be without dissimulation . Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
45:12:010:0	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ;
45:12:011:0	Not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ;
45:12:012:0	Rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ;
45:12:013:0	Distributing to the necessity of saints ; given to hospitality .
45:12:014:0	Bless them which persecute you : bless , and curse not .
45:12:015:0	Rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
45:12:016:0	Be of the same mind one toward another . Mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . Be not wise in your own conceits .
45:12:017:0	Recompense to no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
45:12:018:0	If it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .
45:12:019:0	Dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord .
45:12:020:0	Therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head .
45:12:021:0	Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
