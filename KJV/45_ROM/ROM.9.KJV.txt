45:9:001:0	I say the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost ,
45:9:002:0	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart .
45:9:003:0	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh :
45:9:004:0	Who are Israelites ; to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the service of God , and the promises ;
45:9:005:0	Whose are the fathers , and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came , who is over all , God blessed for ever . Amen .
45:9:006:0	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect . For they are not all Israel , which are of Israel :
45:9:007:0	Neither , because they are the seed of Abraham , are they all children : but , In Isaac shall thy seed be called .
45:9:008:0	That is , They which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
45:9:009:0	For this is the word of promise , At this time will I come , and Sara shall have a son .
45:9:010:0	And not only this ; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one , even by our father Isaac ;
45:9:011:0	( For the children being not yet born , neither having done any good or evil , that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not of works , but of him that calleth ; )
45:9:012:0	It was said unto her , The elder shall serve the younger .
45:9:013:0	As it is written , Jacob have I loved , but Esau have I hated .
45:9:014:0	What shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness with God ? God forbid .
45:9:015:0	For he saith to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion .
45:9:016:0	So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
45:9:017:0	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
45:9:018:0	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth .
45:9:019:0	Thou wilt say then unto me , Why doth he yet find fault ? For who hath resisted his will ?
45:9:020:0	Nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
45:9:021:0	Hath not the potter power over the clay , of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour , and another unto dishonour ?
45:9:022:0	What if God , willing to shew his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction :
45:9:023:0	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which he had afore prepared unto glory ,
45:9:024:0	Even us , whom he hath called , not of the Jews only , but also of the Gentiles ?
45:9:025:0	As he saith also in Osee , I will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her beloved , which was not beloved .
45:9:026:0	And it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God .
45:9:027:0	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved :
45:9:028:0	For he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth .
45:9:029:0	And as Esaias said before , Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , we had been as Sodom , and been made like unto Gomorrha .
45:9:030:0	What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
45:9:031:0	But Israel , which followed after the law of righteousness , hath not attained to the law of righteousness .
45:9:032:0	Wherefore ? Because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . For they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
45:9:033:0	As it is written , Behold , I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence : and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
