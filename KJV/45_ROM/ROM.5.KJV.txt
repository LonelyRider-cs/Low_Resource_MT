45:5:001:0	Therefore being justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ :
45:5:002:0	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
45:5:003:0	And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
45:5:004:0	And patience , experience ; and experience , hope :
45:5:005:0	And hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
45:5:006:0	For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
45:5:007:0	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die .
45:5:008:0	But God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
45:5:009:0	Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
45:5:010:0	For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
45:5:011:0	And not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
45:5:012:0	Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
45:5:013:0	( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
45:5:014:0	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
45:5:015:0	But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
45:5:016:0	And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
45:5:017:0	For if by one man's offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
45:5:018:0	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
45:5:019:0	For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
45:5:020:0	Moreover the law entered , that the offence might abound . But where sin abounded , grace did much more abound :
45:5:021:0	That as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord .
