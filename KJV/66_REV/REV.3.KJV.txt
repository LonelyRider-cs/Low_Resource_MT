66:3:001:0	And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
66:3:002:0	Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
66:3:003:0	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
66:3:004:0	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
66:3:005:0	He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
66:3:006:0	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
66:3:007:0	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
66:3:008:0	I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
66:3:009:0	Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
66:3:010:0	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
66:3:011:0	Behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crown .
66:3:012:0	Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
66:3:013:0	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
66:3:014:0	And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
66:3:015:0	I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
66:3:016:0	So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
66:3:017:0	Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
66:3:018:0	I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
66:3:019:0	As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
66:3:020:0	Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
66:3:021:0	To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
66:3:022:0	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
