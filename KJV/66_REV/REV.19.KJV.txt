66:19:001:0	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia ; Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
66:19:002:0	For true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
66:19:003:0	And again they said , Alleluia . And her smoke rose up for ever and ever .
66:19:004:0	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne , saying , Amen ; Alleluia .
66:19:005:0	And a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
66:19:006:0	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
66:19:007:0	Let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
66:19:008:0	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
66:19:009:0	And he saith unto me , Write , Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb . And he saith unto me , These are the true sayings of God .
66:19:010:0	And I fell at his feet to worship him . And he said unto me , See thou do it not : I am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus : worship God : for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy .
66:19:011:0	And I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
66:19:012:0	His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
66:19:013:0	And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
66:19:014:0	And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and clean .
66:19:015:0	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
66:19:016:0	And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , KING OF KINGS , AND Lord OF LORDS .
66:19:017:0	And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
66:19:018:0	That ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
66:19:019:0	And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
66:19:020:0	And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him , with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast , and them that worshipped his image . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
66:19:021:0	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
