66:1:001:0	The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
66:1:002:0	Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
66:1:003:0	Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
66:1:004:0	John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
66:1:005:0	And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood ,
66:1:006:0	And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
66:1:007:0	Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . Even so , Amen .
66:1:008:0	I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty .
66:1:009:0	I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
66:1:010:0	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
66:1:011:0	Saying , I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last : and , What thou seest , write in a book , and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia ; unto Ephesus , and unto Smyrna , and unto Pergamos , and unto Thyatira , and unto Sardis , and unto Philadelphia , and unto Laodicea .
66:1:012:0	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me . And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
66:1:013:0	And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man , clothed with a garment down to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
66:1:014:0	His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
66:1:015:0	And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
66:1:016:0	And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
66:1:017:0	And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last :
66:1:018:0	I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
66:1:019:0	Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
66:1:020:0	The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
