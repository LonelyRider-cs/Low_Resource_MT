66:12:001:0	And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars :
66:12:002:0	And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
66:12:003:0	And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
66:12:004:0	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
66:12:005:0	And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
66:12:006:0	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
66:12:007:0	And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels ,
66:12:008:0	And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
66:12:009:0	And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
66:12:010:0	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
66:12:011:0	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death .
66:12:012:0	Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
66:12:013:0	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
66:12:014:0	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
66:12:015:0	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
66:12:016:0	And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
66:12:017:0	And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
