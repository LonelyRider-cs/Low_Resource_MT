27:3:001:0	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
27:3:002:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
27:3:003:0	Then the princes , the governors , and captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up ; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
27:3:004:0	Then an herald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , O people , nations , and languages ,
27:3:005:0	That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up :
27:3:006:0	And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
27:3:007:0	Therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all kinds of musick , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
27:3:008:0	Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and accused the Jews .
27:3:009:0	They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar , O king , live for ever .
27:3:010:0	Thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
27:3:011:0	And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
27:3:012:0	There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego ; these men , O king , have not regarded thee : they serve not thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
27:3:013:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego . Then they brought these men before the king .
27:3:014:0	Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
27:3:015:0	Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the image which I have made ; well : but if ye worship not , ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace ; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands ?
27:3:016:0	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , answered and said to the king , O Nebuchadnezzar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
27:3:017:0	If it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of thine hand , O king .
27:3:018:0	But if not , be it known unto thee , O king , that we will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
27:3:019:0	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego : therefore he spake , and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated .
27:3:020:0	And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
27:3:021:0	Then these men were bound in their coats , their hosen , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
27:3:022:0	Therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego .
27:3:023:0	And these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
27:3:024:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished , and rose up in haste , and spake , and said unto his counsellors , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? They answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
27:3:025:0	He answered and said , Lo , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
27:3:026:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace , and spake , and said , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , ye servants of the most high God , come forth , and come hither . Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , came forth of the midst of the fire .
27:3:027:0	And the princes , governors , and captains , and the king 's counsellors , being gathered together , saw these men , upon whose bodies the fire had no power , nor was an hair of their head singed , neither were their coats changed , nor the smell of fire had passed on them .
27:3:028:0	Then Nebuchadnezzar spake , and said , Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , who hath sent his angel , and delivered his servants that trusted in him , and have changed the king 's word , and yielded their bodies , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except their own God .
27:3:029:0	Therefore I make a decree , That every people , nation , and language , which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , shall be cut in pieces , and their houses shall be made a dunghill : because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort .
27:3:030:0	Then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed–nego , in the province of Babylon .
