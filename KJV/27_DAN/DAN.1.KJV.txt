27:1:001:0	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem , and besieged it .
27:1:002:0	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
27:1:003:0	And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs , that he should bring certain of the children of Israel , and of the king 's seed , and of the princes ;
27:1:004:0	Children in whom was no blemish , but well favoured , and skilful in all wisdom , and cunning in knowledge , and understanding science , and such as had ability in them to stand in the king 's palace , and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans .
27:1:005:0	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
27:1:006:0	Now among these were of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah :
27:1:007:0	Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah , of Abedâ€“nego .
27:1:008:0	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
27:1:009:0	Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs .
27:1:010:0	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel , I fear my lord the king , who hath appointed your meat and your drink : for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort ? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king .
27:1:011:0	Then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
27:1:012:0	Prove thy servants , I beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink .
27:1:013:0	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with thy servants .
27:1:014:0	So he consented to them in this matter , and proved them ten days .
27:1:015:0	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
27:1:016:0	Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat , and the wine that they should drink ; and gave them pulse .
27:1:017:0	As for these four children , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
27:1:018:0	Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
27:1:019:0	And the king communed with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : therefore stood they before the king .
27:1:020:0	And in all matters of wisdom and understanding , that the king enquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm .
27:1:021:0	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus .
