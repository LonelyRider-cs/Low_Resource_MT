27:12:001:0	And at that time shall Michael stand up , the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people : and there shall be a time of trouble , such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time : and at that time thy people shall be delivered , every one that shall be found written in the book .
27:12:002:0	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
27:12:003:0	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
27:12:004:0	But thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
27:12:005:0	Then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
27:12:006:0	And one said to the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
27:12:007:0	And I heard the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven , and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time , times , and an half ; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people , all these things shall be finished .
27:12:008:0	And I heard , but I understood not : then said I , O my Lord , what shall be the end of these things ?
27:12:009:0	And he said , Go thy way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
27:12:010:0	Many shall be purified , and made white , and tried ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
27:12:011:0	And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
27:12:012:0	Blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
27:12:013:0	But go thou thy way till the end be : for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days .
