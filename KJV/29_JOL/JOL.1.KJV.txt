29:1:001:0	The word of the that came to Joel the son of Pethuel .
29:1:002:0	Hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . Hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
29:1:003:0	Tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation .
29:1:004:0	That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten .
29:1:005:0	Awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
29:1:006:0	For a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
29:1:007:0	He hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
29:1:008:0	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
29:1:009:0	The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the ; the priests , the ministers , mourn .
29:1:010:0	The field is wasted , the land mourneth ; for the corn is wasted : the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
29:1:011:0	Be ye ashamed , O ye husbandmen ; howl , O ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley ; because the harvest of the field is perished .
29:1:012:0	The vine is dried up , and the fig tree languisheth ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all the trees of the field , are withered : because joy is withered away from the sons of men .
29:1:013:0	Gird yourselves , and lament , ye priests : howl , ye ministers of the altar : come , lie all night in sackcloth , ye ministers of my God : for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God .
29:1:014:0	Sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the your God , and cry unto the ,
29:1:015:0	Alas for the day ! for the day of the is at hand , and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come .
29:1:016:0	Is not the meat cut off before our eyes , yea , joy and gladness from the house of our God ?
29:1:017:0	The seed is rotten under their clods , the garners are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the corn is withered .
29:1:018:0	How do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
29:1:019:0	O , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
29:1:020:0	The beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
