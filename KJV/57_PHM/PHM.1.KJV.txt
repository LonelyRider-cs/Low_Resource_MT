57:1:001:0	Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
57:1:002:0	And to our beloved Apphia , and Archippus our fellowsoldier , and to the church in thy house :
57:1:003:0	Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57:1:004:0	I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
57:1:005:0	Hearing of thy love and faith , which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus , and toward all saints ;
57:1:006:0	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
57:1:007:0	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
57:1:008:0	Wherefore , though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient ,
57:1:009:0	Yet for love 's sake I rather beseech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
57:1:010:0	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
57:1:011:0	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable to thee and to me :
57:1:012:0	Whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
57:1:013:0	Whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
57:1:014:0	But without thy mind would I do nothing ; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity , but willingly .
57:1:015:0	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receive him for ever ;
57:1:016:0	Not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
57:1:017:0	If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
57:1:018:0	If he hath wronged thee , or oweth thee ought , put that on mine account ;
57:1:019:0	I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
57:1:020:0	Yea , brother , let me have joy of thee in the Lord : refresh my bowels in the Lord .
57:1:021:0	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
57:1:022:0	But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
57:1:023:0	There salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ;
57:1:024:0	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , Luke , my fellowlabourers .
57:1:025:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
