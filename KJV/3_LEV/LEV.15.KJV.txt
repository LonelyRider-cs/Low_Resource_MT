3:15:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
3:15:002:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
3:15:003:0	And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue : whether his flesh run with his issue , or his flesh be stopped from his issue , it is his uncleanness .
3:15:004:0	Every bed , whereon he lieth that hath the issue , is unclean : and every thing , whereon he sitteth , shall be unclean .
3:15:005:0	And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:006:0	And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:007:0	And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:008:0	And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean ; then he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:009:0	And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean .
3:15:010:0	And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even : and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:011:0	And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:012:0	And the vessel of earth , that he toucheth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
3:15:013:0	And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
3:15:014:0	And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
3:15:015:0	And the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord for his issue .
3:15:016:0	And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:017:0	And every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:018:0	The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation , they shall both bathe themselves in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:019:0	And if a woman have an issue , and her issue in her flesh be blood , she shall be put apart seven days : and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even .
3:15:020:0	And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean : every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean .
3:15:021:0	And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:022:0	And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:023:0	And if it be on her bed , or on any thing whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
3:15:024:0	And if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean .
3:15:025:0	And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation , or if it run beyond the time of her separation ; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation : she shall be unclean .
3:15:026:0	Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation : and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean , as the uncleanness of her separation .
3:15:027:0	And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
3:15:028:0	But if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
3:15:029:0	And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles , or two young pigeons , and bring them unto the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
3:15:030:0	And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness .
3:15:031:0	Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
3:15:032:0	This is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed goeth from him , and is defiled therewith ;
3:15:033:0	And of her that is sick of her flowers , and of him that hath an issue , of the man , and of the woman , and of him that lieth with her that is unclean .
