3:7:001:0	Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering : it is most holy .
3:7:002:0	In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar .
3:7:003:0	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof ; the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards ,
3:7:004:0	And the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul that is above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away :
3:7:005:0	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord : it is a trespass offering .
3:7:006:0	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof : it shall be eaten in the holy place : it is most holy .
3:7:007:0	As the sin offering is , so is the trespass offering : there is one law for them : the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it .
3:7:008:0	And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
3:7:009:0	And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest's that offereth it .
3:7:010:0	And every meat offering , mingled with oil , and dry , shall all the sons of Aaron have , one as much as another .
3:7:011:0	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he shall offer unto the Lord .
3:7:012:0	If he offer it for a thanksgiving , then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and cakes mingled with oil , of fine flour , fried .
3:7:013:0	Besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
3:7:014:0	And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord , and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
3:7:015:0	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
3:7:016:0	But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow , or a voluntary offering , it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice : and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten :
3:7:017:0	But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire .
3:7:018:0	And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it : it shall be an abomination , and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity .
3:7:019:0	And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten ; it shall be burnt with fire : and as for the flesh , all that be clean shall eat thereof .
3:7:020:0	But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , that pertain unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
3:7:021:0	Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing , as the uncleanness of man , or any unclean beast , or any abominable unclean thing , and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which pertain unto the Lord , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
3:7:022:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:7:023:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Ye shall eat no manner of fat , of ox , or of sheep , or of goat .
3:7:024:0	And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself , and the fat of that which is torn with beasts , may be used in any other use : but ye shall in no wise eat of it .
3:7:025:0	For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast , of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord , even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people .
3:7:026:0	Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
3:7:027:0	Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
3:7:028:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:7:029:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings .
3:7:030:0	His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord .
3:7:031:0	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar : but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons' .
3:7:032:0	And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
3:7:033:0	He among the sons of Aaron , that offereth the blood of the peace offerings , and the fat , shall have the right shoulder for his part .
3:7:034:0	For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel .
3:7:035:0	This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office ;
3:7:036:0	Which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
3:7:037:0	This is the law of the burnt offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecrations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ;
3:7:038:0	Which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord , in the wilderness of Sinai .
