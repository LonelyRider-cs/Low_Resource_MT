3:17:001:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:17:002:0	Speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the hath commanded , saying ,
3:17:003:0	What man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
3:17:004:0	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , to offer an offering unto the before the tabernacle of the ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
3:17:005:0	To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the .
3:17:006:0	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the .
3:17:007:0	And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring . This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
3:17:008:0	And thou shalt say unto them , Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers which sojourn among you , that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice ,
3:17:009:0	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , to offer it unto the ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
3:17:010:0	And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
3:17:011:0	For the life of the flesh is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul .
3:17:012:0	Therefore I said unto the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
3:17:013:0	And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
3:17:014:0	For it is the life of all flesh ; the blood of it is for the life thereof : therefore I said unto the children of Israel , Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh : for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off .
3:17:015:0	And every soul that eateth that which died of itself , or that which was torn with beasts , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .
3:17:016:0	But if he wash them not , nor bathe his flesh ; then he shall bear his iniquity .
