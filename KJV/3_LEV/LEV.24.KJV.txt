3:24:002:0	Command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
3:24:003:0	Without the veil of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
3:24:004:0	He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the continually .
3:24:005:0	And thou shalt take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes thereof : two tenth deals shall be in one cake .
3:24:006:0	And thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before the .
3:24:007:0	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the .
3:24:008:0	Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the continually , being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant .
3:24:009:0	And it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the made by fire by a perpetual statute .
3:24:010:0	And the son of an Israelite woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
3:24:011:0	And the Israelite woman 's son blasphemed the name of the , and cursed . And they brought him unto Moses : ( and his mother 's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan : )
3:24:012:0	And they put him in ward , that the mind of the might be shewed them .
3:24:013:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:24:014:0	Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
3:24:015:0	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin .
3:24:016:0	And he that blasphemeth the name of the , he shall surely be put to death , and all the congregation shall certainly stone him : as well the stranger , as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the , shall be put to death .
3:24:017:0	And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death .
3:24:018:0	And he that killeth a beast shall make it good ; beast for beast .
3:24:019:0	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
3:24:020:0	Breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth : as he hath caused a blemish in a man , so shall it be done to him again .
3:24:021:0	And he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
3:24:022:0	Ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the your God .
3:24:023:0	And Moses spake to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . And the children of Israel did as the commanded Moses .
