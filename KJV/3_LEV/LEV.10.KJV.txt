3:10:001:0	And Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his censer , and put fire therein , and put incense thereon , and offered strange fire before the , which he commanded them not .
3:10:002:0	And there went out fire from the , and devoured them , and they died before the .
3:10:003:0	Then Moses said unto Aaron , This is it that the spake , saying , I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me , and before all the people I will be glorified . And Aaron held his peace .
3:10:004:0	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
3:10:005:0	So they went near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp ; as Moses had said .
3:10:006:0	And Moses said unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons , Uncover not your heads , neither rend your clothes ; lest ye die , and lest wrath come upon all the people : but let your brethren , the whole house of Israel , bewail the burning which the hath kindled .
3:10:007:0	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : for the anointing oil of the is upon you . And they did according to the word of Moses .
3:10:008:0	And the spake unto Aaron , saying ,
3:10:009:0	Do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
3:10:010:0	And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy , and between unclean and clean ;
3:10:011:0	And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses .
3:10:012:0	And Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy :
3:10:013:0	And ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is thy due , and thy sons ' due , of the sacrifices of the made by fire : for so I am commanded .
3:10:014:0	And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place ; thou , and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee : for they be thy due , and thy sons ' due , which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel .
3:10:015:0	The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat , to wave it for a wave offering before the ; and it shall be thine , and thy sons ' with thee , by a statute for ever ; as the hath commanded .
3:10:016:0	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying ,
3:10:017:0	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the ?
3:10:018:0	Behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
3:10:019:0	And Aaron said unto Moses , Behold , this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the ; and such things have befallen me : and if I had eaten the sin offering to day , should it have been accepted in the sight of the ?
3:10:020:0	And when Moses heard that , he was content .
