3:22:001:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:22:002:0	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the .
3:22:003:0	Say unto them , Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto the , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from my presence : I am the .
3:22:004:0	What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper , or hath a running issue ; he shall not eat of the holy things , until he be clean . And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead , or a man whose seed goeth from him ;
3:22:005:0	Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
3:22:006:0	The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
3:22:007:0	And when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
3:22:008:0	That which dieth of itself , or is torn with beasts , he shall not eat to defile himself therewith : I am the .
3:22:009:0	They shall therefore keep mine ordinance , lest they bear sin for it , and die therefore , if they profane it : I the do sanctify them .
3:22:010:0	There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing : a sojourner of the priest , or an hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
3:22:011:0	But if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
3:22:012:0	If the priest 's daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
3:22:013:0	But if the priest 's daughter be a widow , or divorced , and have no child , and is returned unto her father 's house , as in her youth , she shall eat of her father 's meat : but there shall no stranger eat thereof .
3:22:014:0	And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
3:22:015:0	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the ;
3:22:016:0	Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass , when they eat their holy things : for I the do sanctify them .
3:22:017:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:22:018:0	Speak unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them , Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers in Israel , that will offer his oblation for all his vows , and for all his freewill offerings , which they will offer unto the for a burnt offering ;
3:22:019:0	Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish , of the beeves , of the sheep , or of the goats .
3:22:020:0	But whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
3:22:021:0	And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the to accomplish his vow , or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep , it shall be perfect to be accepted ; there shall be no blemish therein .
3:22:022:0	Blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the .
3:22:023:0	Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts , that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering ; but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
3:22:024:0	Ye shall not offer unto the that which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
3:22:025:0	Neither from a stranger 's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and blemishes be in them : they shall not be accepted for you .
3:22:026:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:22:027:0	When a bullock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the .
3:22:028:0	And whether it be cow or ewe , ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day .
3:22:029:0	And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the , offer it at your own will .
3:22:030:0	On the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the .
3:22:031:0	Therefore shall ye keep my commandments , and do them : I am the .
3:22:032:0	Neither shall ye profane my holy name ; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel : I am the which hallow you ,
3:22:033:0	That brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the .
