3:20:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:20:002:0	Again , thou shalt say to the children of Israel , Whosoever he be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel , that giveth any of his seed unto Molech ; he shall surely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
3:20:003:0	And I will set my face against that man , and will cut him off from among his people ; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech , to defile my sanctuary , and to profane my holy name .
3:20:004:0	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he giveth of his seed unto Molech , and kill him not :
3:20:005:0	Then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a whoring after him , to commit whoredom with Molech , from among their people .
3:20:006:0	And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
3:20:007:0	Sanctify yourselves therefore , and be ye holy : for I am the Lord your God .
3:20:008:0	And ye shall keep my statutes , and do them : I am the Lord which sanctify you .
3:20:009:0	For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
3:20:010:0	And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
3:20:011:0	And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
3:20:012:0	And if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
3:20:013:0	If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
3:20:014:0	And if a man take a wife and her mother , it is wickedness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no wickedness among you .
3:20:015:0	And if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast .
3:20:016:0	And if a woman approach unto any beast , and lie down thereto , thou shalt kill the woman , and the beast : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
3:20:017:0	And if a man shall take his sister , his father's daughter , or his mother's daughter , and see her nakedness , and she see his nakedness ; it is a wicked thing ; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people : he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness ; he shall bear his iniquity .
3:20:018:0	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall uncover her nakedness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
3:20:019:0	And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister , nor of thy father's sister : for he uncovereth his near kin : they shall bear their iniquity .
3:20:020:0	And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife , he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness : they shall bear their sin ; they shall die childless .
3:20:021:0	And if a man shall take his brother's wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness ; they shall be childless .
3:20:022:0	Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither I bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
3:20:023:0	And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I abhorred them .
3:20:024:0	But I have said unto you , Ye shall inherit their land , and I will give it unto you to possess it , a land that floweth with milk and honey : I am the Lord your God , which have separated you from other people .
3:20:025:0	Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean , and between unclean fowls and clean : and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast , or by fowl , or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground , which I have separated from you as unclean .
3:20:026:0	And ye shall be holy unto me : for I the Lord am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
3:20:027:0	A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
