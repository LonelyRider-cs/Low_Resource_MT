3:25:001:0	And the spake unto Moses in mount Sinai , saying ,
3:25:002:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the .
3:25:003:0	Six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
3:25:004:0	But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
3:25:005:0	That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
3:25:006:0	And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
3:25:007:0	And for thy cattle , and for the beast that are in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
3:25:008:0	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
3:25:009:0	Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
3:25:010:0	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubilee unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
3:25:011:0	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
3:25:012:0	For it is the jubilee ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
3:25:013:0	In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession .
3:25:014:0	And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour 's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
3:25:015:0	According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
3:25:016:0	According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
3:25:017:0	Ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy God : for I am the your God .
3:25:018:0	Wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
3:25:019:0	And the land shall yield her fruit , and ye shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
3:25:020:0	And if ye shall say , What shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase :
3:25:021:0	Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for three years .
3:25:022:0	And ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
3:25:023:0	The land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
3:25:024:0	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
3:25:025:0	If thy brother be waxen poor , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
3:25:026:0	And if the man have none to redeem it , and himself be able to redeem it ;
3:25:027:0	Then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
3:25:028:0	But if he be not able to restore it to him , then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee : and in the jubilee it shall go out , and he shall return unto his possession .
3:25:029:0	And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
3:25:030:0	And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jubilee .
3:25:031:0	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubilee .
3:25:032:0	Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the Levites redeem at any time .
3:25:033:0	And if a man purchase of the Levites , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of jubilee : for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
3:25:034:0	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
3:25:035:0	And if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
3:25:036:0	Take thou no usury of him , or increase : but fear thy God ; that thy brother may live with thee .
3:25:037:0	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury , nor lend him thy victuals for increase .
3:25:038:0	I am the your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
3:25:039:0	And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sold unto thee ; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant :
3:25:040:0	But as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee :
3:25:041:0	And then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
3:25:042:0	For they are my servants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .
3:25:043:0	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour ; but shalt fear thy God .
3:25:044:0	Both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
3:25:045:0	Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land : and they shall be your possession .
3:25:046:0	And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession ; they shall be your bondmen for ever : but over your brethren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
3:25:047:0	And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
3:25:048:0	After that he is sold he may be redeemed again ; one of his brethren may redeem him :
3:25:049:0	Either his uncle , or his uncle 's son , may redeem him , or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him ; or if he be able , he may redeem himself .
3:25:050:0	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee : and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years , according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him .
3:25:051:0	If there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
3:25:052:0	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
3:25:053:0	And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him : and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight .
3:25:054:0	And if he be not redeemed in these years , then he shall go out in the year of jubilee , both he , and his children with him .
3:25:055:0	For unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the your God .
