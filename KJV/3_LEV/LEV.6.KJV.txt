3:6:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:6:002:0	If a soul sin , and commit a trespass against the Lord , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
3:6:003:0	Or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein :
3:6:004:0	Then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
3:6:005:0	Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
3:6:006:0	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
3:6:007:0	And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein .
3:6:008:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:6:009:0	Command Aaron and his sons , saying , This is the law of the burnt offering : It is the burnt offering , because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning , and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it .
3:6:010:0	And the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
3:6:011:0	And he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
3:6:012:0	And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it ; it shall not be put out : and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning , and lay the burnt offering in order upon it ; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings .
3:6:013:0	The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar ; it shall never go out .
3:6:014:0	And this is the law of the meat offering : the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord , before the altar .
3:6:015:0	And he shall take of it his handful , of the flour of the meat offering , and of the oil thereof , and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering , and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour , even the memorial of it , unto the Lord .
3:6:016:0	And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it .
3:6:017:0	It shall not be baken with leaven . I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
3:6:018:0	All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it . It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire : every one that toucheth them shall be holy .
3:6:019:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:6:020:0	This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons , which they shall offer unto the Lord in the day when he is anointed ; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual , half of it in the morning , and half thereof at night .
3:6:021:0	In a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is baken , thou shalt bring it in : and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
3:6:022:0	And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the Lord ; it shall be wholly burnt .
3:6:023:0	For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt : it shall not be eaten .
3:6:024:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:6:025:0	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons , saying , This is the law of the sin offering : In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord : it is most holy .
3:6:026:0	The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation .
3:6:027:0	Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
3:6:028:0	But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken : and if it be sodden in a brasen pot , it shall be both scoured , and rinsed in water .
3:6:029:0	All the males among the priests shall eat thereof : it is most holy .
3:6:030:0	And no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
