3:21:001:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron , and say unto them , There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people :
3:21:002:0	But for his kin , that is near unto him , that is , for his mother , and for his father , and for his son , and for his daughter , and for his brother ,
3:21:003:0	And for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
3:21:004:0	But he shall not defile himself , being a chief man among his people , to profane himself .
3:21:005:0	They shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
3:21:006:0	They shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God : for the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
3:21:007:0	They shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
3:21:008:0	Thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the Lord , which sanctify you , am holy .
3:21:009:0	And the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the whore , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire .
3:21:010:0	And he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ;
3:21:011:0	Neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
3:21:012:0	Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
3:21:013:0	And he shall take a wife in her virginity .
3:21:014:0	A widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
3:21:015:0	Neither shall he profane his seed among his people : for I the Lord do sanctify him .
3:21:016:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:21:017:0	Speak unto Aaron , saying , Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his God .
3:21:018:0	For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous ,
3:21:019:0	Or a man that is brokenfooted , or brokenhanded ,
3:21:020:0	Or crookbackt , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or be scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
3:21:021:0	No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire : he hath a blemish ; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God .
3:21:022:0	He shall eat the bread of his God , both of the most holy , and of the holy .
3:21:023:0	Only he shall not go in unto the veil , nor come nigh unto the altar , because he hath a blemish ; that he profane not my sanctuaries : for I the Lord do sanctify them .
3:21:024:0	And Moses told it unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel .
