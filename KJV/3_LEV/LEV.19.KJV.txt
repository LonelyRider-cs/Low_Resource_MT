3:19:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
3:19:002:0	Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the Lord your God am holy .
3:19:003:0	Ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the Lord your God .
3:19:004:0	Turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : I am the Lord your God .
3:19:005:0	And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , ye shall offer it at your own will .
3:19:006:0	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the morrow : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
3:19:007:0	And if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is abominable ; it shall not be accepted .
3:19:008:0	Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
3:19:009:0	And when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
3:19:010:0	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the Lord your God .
3:19:011:0	Ye shall not steal , neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another .
3:19:012:0	And ye shall not swear by my name falsely , neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God : I am the Lord .
3:19:013:0	Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour , neither rob him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
3:19:014:0	Thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind , but shalt fear thy God : I am the Lord .
3:19:015:0	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour .
3:19:016:0	Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour : I am the Lord .
3:19:017:0	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him .
3:19:018:0	Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : I am the Lord .
3:19:019:0	Ye shall keep my statutes . Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .
3:19:020:0	And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman , that is a bondmaid , betrothed to an husband , and not at all redeemed , nor freedom given her ; she shall be scourged ; they shall not be put to death , because she was not free .
3:19:021:0	And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , even a ram for a trespass offering .
3:19:022:0	And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done : and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him .
3:19:023:0	And when ye shall come into the land , and shall have planted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised : three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you : it shall not be eaten of .
3:19:024:0	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the Lord withal .
3:19:025:0	And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the Lord your God .
3:19:026:0	Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantment , nor observe times .
3:19:027:0	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard .
3:19:028:0	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the Lord .
3:19:029:0	Do not prostitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
3:19:030:0	Ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : I am the Lord .
3:19:031:0	Regard not them that have familiar spirits , neither seek after wizards , to be defiled by them : I am the Lord your God .
3:19:032:0	Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honour the face of the old man , and fear thy God : I am the Lord .
3:19:033:0	And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not vex him .
3:19:034:0	But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
3:19:035:0	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment , in meteyard , in weight , or in measure .
3:19:036:0	Just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
3:19:037:0	Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : I am the Lord .
