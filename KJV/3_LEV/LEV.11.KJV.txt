3:11:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron , saying unto them ,
3:11:002:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
3:11:003:0	Whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
3:11:004:0	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
3:11:005:0	And the coney , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
3:11:006:0	And the hare , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
3:11:007:0	And the swine , though he divide the hoof , and be clovenfooted , yet he cheweth not the cud ; he is unclean to you .
3:11:008:0	Of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
3:11:009:0	These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
3:11:010:0	And all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
3:11:011:0	They shall be even an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall have their carcases in abomination .
3:11:012:0	Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that shall be an abomination unto you .
3:11:013:0	And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
3:11:014:0	And the vulture , and the kite after his kind ;
3:11:015:0	Every raven after his kind ;
3:11:016:0	And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
3:11:017:0	And the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl ,
3:11:018:0	And the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle ,
3:11:019:0	And the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
3:11:020:0	All fowls that creep , going upon all four , shall be an abomination unto you .
3:11:021:0	Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ;
3:11:022:0	Even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
3:11:023:0	But all other flying creeping things , which have four feet , shall be an abomination unto you .
3:11:024:0	And for these ye shall be unclean : whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even .
3:11:025:0	And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
3:11:026:0	The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof , and is not clovenfooted , nor cheweth the cud , are unclean unto you : every one that toucheth them shall be unclean .
3:11:027:0	And whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
3:11:028:0	And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
3:11:029:0	These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind ,
3:11:030:0	And the ferret , and the chameleon , and the lizard , and the snail , and the mole .
3:11:031:0	These are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
3:11:032:0	And upon whatsoever any of them , when they are dead , doth fall , it shall be unclean ; whether it be any vessel of wood , or raiment , or skin , or sack , whatsoever vessel it be , wherein any work is done , it must be put into water , and it shall be unclean until the even ; so it shall be cleansed .
3:11:033:0	And every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it .
3:11:034:0	Of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
3:11:035:0	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are unclean , and shall be unclean unto you .
3:11:036:0	Nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
3:11:037:0	And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean .
3:11:038:0	But if any water be put upon the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
3:11:039:0	And if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even .
3:11:040:0	And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
3:11:041:0	And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
3:11:042:0	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
3:11:043:0	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
3:11:044:0	For I am the Lord your God : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
3:11:045:0	For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
3:11:046:0	This is the law of the beasts , and of the fowl , and of every living creature that moveth in the waters , and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth :
3:11:047:0	To make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten .
