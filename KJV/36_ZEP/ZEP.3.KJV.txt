36:3:001:0	Woe to her that is filthy and polluted , to the oppressing city !
36:3:002:0	She obeyed not the voice ; she received not correction ; she trusted not in the ; she drew not near to her God .
36:3:003:0	Her princes within her are roaring lions ; her judges are evening wolves ; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow .
36:3:004:0	Her prophets are light and treacherous persons : her priests have polluted the sanctuary , they have done violence to the law .
36:3:005:0	The just is in the midst thereof ; he will not do iniquity : every morning doth he bring his judgment to light , he faileth not ; but the unjust knoweth no shame .
36:3:006:0	I have cut off the nations : their towers are desolate ; I made their streets waste , that none passeth by : their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is none inhabitant .
36:3:007:0	I said , Surely thou wilt fear me , thou wilt receive instruction ; so their dwelling should not be cut off , howsoever I punished them : but they rose early , and corrupted all their doings .
36:3:008:0	Therefore wait ye upon me , saith the , until the day that I rise up to the prey : for my determination is to gather the nations , that I may assemble the kingdoms , to pour upon them mine indignation , even all my fierce anger : for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy .
36:3:009:0	For then will I turn to the people a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of the , to serve him with one consent .
36:3:010:0	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
36:3:011:0	In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings , wherein thou hast transgressed against me : for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain .
36:3:012:0	I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the .
36:3:013:0	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
36:3:014:0	Sing , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O Israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem .
36:3:015:0	The hath taken away thy judgments , he hath cast out thine enemy : the king of Israel , even the , is in the midst of thee : thou shalt not see evil any more .
36:3:016:0	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem , Fear thou not : and to Zion , Let not thine hands be slack .
36:3:017:0	The thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
36:3:018:0	I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly , who are of thee , to whom the reproach of it was a burden .
36:3:019:0	Behold , at that time I will undo all that afflict thee : and I will save her that halteth , and gather her that was driven out ; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame .
36:3:020:0	At that time will I bring you again , even in the time that I gather you : for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when I turn back your captivity before your eyes , saith the .
