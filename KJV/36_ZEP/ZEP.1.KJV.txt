36:1:001:0	The word of the which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hizkiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
36:1:002:0	I will utterly consume all things from off the land , saith the .
36:1:003:0	I will consume man and beast ; I will consume the fowls of the heaven , and the fishes of the sea , and the stumblingblocks with the wicked ; and I will cut off man from off the land , saith the .
36:1:004:0	I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah , and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place , and the name of the Chemarims with the priests ;
36:1:005:0	And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops ; and them that worship and that swear by the , and that swear by Malcham ;
36:1:006:0	And them that are turned back from the ; and those that have not sought the , nor enquired for him .
36:1:007:0	Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord : for the day of the is at hand : for the hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath bid his guests .
36:1:008:0	And it shall come to pass in the day of the sacrifice , that I will punish the princes , and the king 's children , and all such as are clothed with strange apparel .
36:1:009:0	In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill their masters ' houses with violence and deceit .
36:1:010:0	And it shall come to pass in that day , saith the , that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate , and an howling from the second , and a great crashing from the hills .
36:1:011:0	Howl , ye inhabitants of Maktesh , for all the merchant people are cut down ; all they that bear silver are cut off .
36:1:012:0	And it shall come to pass at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their lees : that say in their heart , The will not do good , neither will he do evil .
36:1:013:0	Therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation : they shall also build houses , but not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , but not drink the wine thereof .
36:1:014:0	The great day of the is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
36:1:015:0	That day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
36:1:016:0	A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities , and against the high towers .
36:1:017:0	And I will bring distress upon men , that they shall walk like blind men , because they have sinned against the : and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as the dung .
36:1:018:0	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath ; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy : for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land .
