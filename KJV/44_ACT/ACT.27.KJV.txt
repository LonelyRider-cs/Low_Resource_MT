44:27:001:0	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
44:27:002:0	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
44:27:003:0	And the next day we touched at Sidon . And Julius courteously entreated Paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
44:27:004:0	And when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
44:27:005:0	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
44:27:006:0	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy ; and he put us therein .
44:27:007:0	And when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
44:27:008:0	And , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called The fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea .
44:27:009:0	Now when much time was spent , and when sailing was now dangerous , because the fast was now already past , Paul admonished them ,
44:27:010:0	And said unto them , Sirs , I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage , not only of the lading and ship , but also of our lives .
44:27:011:0	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
44:27:012:0	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to Phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of Crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
44:27:013:0	And when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , loosing thence , they sailed close by Crete .
44:27:014:0	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind , called Euroclydon .
44:27:015:0	And when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
44:27:016:0	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda , we had much work to come by the boat :
44:27:017:0	Which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
44:27:018:0	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest , the next day they lightened the ship ;
44:27:019:0	And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
44:27:020:0	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
44:27:021:0	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
44:27:022:0	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
44:27:023:0	For there stood by me this night the angel of God , whose I am , and whom I serve ,
44:27:024:0	Saying , Fear not , Paul ; thou must be brought before Caesar : and , lo , God hath given thee all them that sail with thee .
44:27:025:0	Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
44:27:026:0	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island .
44:27:027:0	But when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
44:27:028:0	And sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
44:27:029:0	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
44:27:030:0	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
44:27:031:0	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , Except these abide in the ship , ye can not be saved .
44:27:032:0	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
44:27:033:0	And while the day was coming on , Paul besought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
44:27:034:0	Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
44:27:035:0	And when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
44:27:036:0	Then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
44:27:037:0	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
44:27:038:0	And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
44:27:039:0	And when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
44:27:040:0	And when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
44:27:041:0	And falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
44:27:042:0	And the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
44:27:043:0	But the centurion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
44:27:044:0	And the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . And so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
