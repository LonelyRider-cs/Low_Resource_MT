44:20:001:0	And after the uproar was ceased , Paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into Macedonia .
44:20:002:0	And when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
44:20:003:0	And there abode three months . And when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into Syria , he purposed to return through Macedonia .
44:20:004:0	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy ; and of Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .
44:20:005:0	These going before tarried for us at Troas .
44:20:006:0	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to Troas in five days ; where we abode seven days .
44:20:007:0	And upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
44:20:008:0	And there were many lights in the upper chamber , where they were gathered together .
44:20:009:0	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
44:20:010:0	And Paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , Trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
44:20:011:0	When he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
44:20:012:0	And they brought the young man alive , and were not a little comforted .
44:20:013:0	And we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
44:20:014:0	And when he met with us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
44:20:015:0	And we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios ; and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next day we came to Miletus .
44:20:016:0	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
44:20:017:0	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
44:20:018:0	And when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
44:20:019:0	Serving the Lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
44:20:020:0	And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
44:20:021:0	Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
44:20:022:0	And now , behold , I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
44:20:023:0	Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
44:20:024:0	But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
44:20:025:0	And now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
44:20:026:0	Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
44:20:027:0	For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God .
44:20:028:0	Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
44:20:029:0	For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
44:20:030:0	Also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
44:20:031:0	Therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
44:20:032:0	And now , brethren , I commend you to God , and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you up , and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified .
44:20:033:0	I have coveted no man's silver , or gold , or apparel .
44:20:034:0	Yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
44:20:035:0	I have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , It is more blessed to give than to receive .
44:20:036:0	And when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
44:20:037:0	And they all wept sore , and fell on Paul's neck , and kissed him ,
44:20:038:0	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake , that they should see his face no more . And they accompanied him unto the ship .
