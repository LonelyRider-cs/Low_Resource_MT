44:24:001:0	And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named Tertullus , who informed the governor against Paul .
44:24:002:0	And when he was called forth , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness , and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence ,
44:24:003:0	We accept it always , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thankfulness .
44:24:004:0	Notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
44:24:005:0	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes :
44:24:006:0	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
44:24:007:0	But the chief captain Lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands ,
44:24:008:0	Commanding his accusers to come unto thee : by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things , whereof we accuse him .
44:24:009:0	And the Jews also assented , saying that these things were so .
44:24:010:0	Then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
44:24:011:0	Because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship .
44:24:012:0	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
44:24:013:0	Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me .
44:24:014:0	But this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
44:24:015:0	And have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
44:24:016:0	And herein do I exercise myself , to have always a conscience void of offence toward God , and toward men .
44:24:017:0	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings .
44:24:018:0	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
44:24:019:0	Who ought to have been here before thee , and object , if they had ought against me .
44:24:020:0	Or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
44:24:021:0	Except it be for this one voice , that I cried standing among them , Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day .
44:24:022:0	And when Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , When Lysias the chief captain shall come down , I will know the uttermost of your matter .
44:24:023:0	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
44:24:024:0	And after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
44:24:025:0	And as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come , Felix trembled , and answered , Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee .
44:24:026:0	He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
44:24:027:0	But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
