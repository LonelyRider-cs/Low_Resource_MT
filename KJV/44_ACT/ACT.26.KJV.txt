44:26:001:0	Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Thou art permitted to speak for thyself . Then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
44:26:002:0	I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews :
44:26:003:0	Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
44:26:004:0	My manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ;
44:26:005:0	Which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
44:26:006:0	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers :
44:26:007:0	Unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . For which hope's sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
44:26:008:0	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
44:26:009:0	I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44:26:010:0	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
44:26:011:0	And I punished them oft in every synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them , I persecuted them even unto strange cities .
44:26:012:0	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests ,
44:26:013:0	At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
44:26:014:0	And when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
44:26:015:0	And I said , Who art thou , Lord ? And he said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest .
44:26:016:0	But rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
44:26:017:0	Delivering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee ,
44:26:018:0	To open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .
44:26:019:0	Whereupon , O king Agrippa , I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :
44:26:020:0	But shewed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
44:26:021:0	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
44:26:022:0	Having therefore obtained help of God , I continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come :
44:26:023:0	That Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the Gentiles .
44:26:024:0	And as he thus spake for himself , Festus said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad .
44:26:025:0	But he said , I am not mad , most noble Festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
44:26:026:0	For the king knoweth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
44:26:027:0	King Agrippa , believest thou the prophets ? I know that thou believest .
44:26:028:0	Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian .
44:26:029:0	And Paul said , I would to God , that not only thou , but also all that hear me this day , were both almost , and altogether such as I am , except these bonds .
44:26:030:0	And when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and they that sat with them :
44:26:031:0	And when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
44:26:032:0	Then said Agrippa unto Festus , This man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto Caesar .
