44:4:001:0	And as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
44:4:002:0	Being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44:4:003:0	And they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
44:4:004:0	Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
44:4:005:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
44:4:006:0	And Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
44:4:007:0	And when they had set them in the midst , they asked , By what power , or by what name , have ye done this ?
44:4:008:0	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
44:4:009:0	If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ;
44:4:010:0	Be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
44:4:011:0	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders , which is become the head of the corner .
44:4:012:0	Neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved .
44:4:013:0	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
44:4:014:0	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
44:4:015:0	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
44:4:016:0	Saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem ; and we can not deny it .
44:4:017:0	But that it spread no further among the people , let us straitly threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
44:4:018:0	And they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
44:4:019:0	But Peter and John answered and said unto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God , judge ye .
44:4:020:0	For we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
44:4:021:0	So when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
44:4:022:0	For the man was above forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
44:4:023:0	And being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
44:4:024:0	And when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
44:4:025:0	Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
44:4:026:0	The kings of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord , and against his Christ .
44:4:027:0	For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
44:4:028:0	For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
44:4:029:0	And now , Lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word ,
44:4:030:0	By stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
44:4:031:0	And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
44:4:032:0	And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
44:4:033:0	And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
44:4:034:0	Neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
44:4:035:0	And laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
44:4:036:0	And Joses , who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas , ( which is , being interpreted , The son of consolation , ) a Levite , and of the country of Cyprus ,
44:4:037:0	Having land , sold it , and brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
