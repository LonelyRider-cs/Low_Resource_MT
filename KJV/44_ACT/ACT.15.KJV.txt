44:15:001:0	And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren , and said , Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses , ye cannot be saved .
44:15:002:0	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
44:15:003:0	And being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
44:15:004:0	And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
44:15:005:0	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed , saying , That it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses .
44:15:006:0	And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
44:15:007:0	And when there had been much disputing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
44:15:008:0	And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ;
44:15:009:0	And put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
44:15:010:0	Now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
44:15:011:0	But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved , even as they .
44:15:012:0	Then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
44:15:013:0	And after they had held their peace , James answered , saying , Men and brethren , hearken unto me :
44:15:014:0	Simon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
44:15:015:0	And to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
44:15:016:0	After this I will return , and will build again the tabernacle of David , which is fallen down ; and I will build again the ruins thereof , and I will set it up :
44:15:017:0	That the residue of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the Lord , who doeth all these things .
44:15:018:0	Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world .
44:15:019:0	Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God :
44:15:020:0	But that we write unto them , that they abstain from pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
44:15:021:0	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
44:15:022:0	Then pleased it the apostles and elders , with the whole church , to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; namely , Judas surnamed Barsabas , and Silas , chief men among the brethren :
44:15:023:0	And they wrote letters by them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia :
44:15:024:0	Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
44:15:025:0	It seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44:15:026:0	Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44:15:027:0	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
44:15:028:0	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
44:15:029:0	That ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . Fare ye well .
44:15:030:0	So when they were dismissed , they came to Antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle :
44:15:031:0	Which when they had read , they rejoiced for the consolation .
44:15:032:0	And Judas and Silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
44:15:033:0	And after they had tarried there a space , they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
44:15:034:0	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still .
44:15:035:0	Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
44:15:036:0	And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas , Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord , and see how they do .
44:15:037:0	And Barnabas determined to take with them John , whose surname was Mark .
44:15:038:0	But Paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
44:15:039:0	And the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ;
44:15:040:0	And Paul chose Silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God .
44:15:041:0	And he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the churches .
