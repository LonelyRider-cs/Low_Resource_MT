44:9:001:0	And Saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest ,
44:9:002:0	And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
44:9:003:0	And as he journeyed , he came near Damascus : and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven :
44:9:004:0	And he fell to the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
44:9:005:0	And he said , Who art thou , Lord ? And the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
44:9:006:0	And he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? And the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
44:9:007:0	And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
44:9:008:0	And Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
44:9:009:0	And he was three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink .
44:9:010:0	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias . And he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
44:9:011:0	And the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the street which is called Straight , and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul , of Tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth ,
44:9:012:0	And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
44:9:013:0	Then Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem :
44:9:014:0	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name .
44:9:015:0	But the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles , and kings , and the children of Israel :
44:9:016:0	For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name 's sake .
44:9:017:0	And Ananias went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest , hath sent me , that thou mightest receive thy sight , and be filled with the Holy Ghost .
44:9:018:0	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
44:9:019:0	And when he had received meat , he was strengthened . Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
44:9:020:0	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues , that he is the Son of God .
44:9:021:0	But all that heard him were amazed , and said ; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
44:9:022:0	But Saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is very Christ .
44:9:023:0	And after that many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel to kill him :
44:9:024:0	But their laying await was known of Saul . And they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
44:9:025:0	Then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
44:9:026:0	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
44:9:027:0	But Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
44:9:028:0	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem .
44:9:029:0	And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
44:9:030:0	Which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
44:9:031:0	Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
44:9:032:0	And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
44:9:033:0	And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
44:9:034:0	And Peter said unto him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . And he arose immediately .
44:9:035:0	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him , and turned to the Lord .
44:9:036:0	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which by interpretation is called Dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
44:9:037:0	And it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
44:9:038:0	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
44:9:039:0	Then Peter arose and went with them . When he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made , while she was with them .
44:9:040:0	But Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise . And she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44:9:041:0	And he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
44:9:042:0	And it was known throughout all Joppa ; and many believed in the Lord .
44:9:043:0	And it came to pass , that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner .
