44:25:001:0	Now when Festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
44:25:002:0	Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul , and besought him ,
44:25:003:0	And desired favour against him , that he would send for him to Jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
44:25:004:0	But Festus answered , that Paul should be kept at Caesarea , and that he himself would depart shortly thither .
44:25:005:0	Let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go down with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickedness in him .
44:25:006:0	And when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto Caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought .
44:25:007:0	And when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
44:25:008:0	While he answered for himself , Neither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against Caesar , have I offended any thing at all .
44:25:009:0	But Festus , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
44:25:010:0	Then said Paul , I stand at Caesar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
44:25:011:0	For if I be an offender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them . I appeal unto Caesar .
44:25:012:0	Then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , Hast thou appealed unto Caesar ? unto Caesar shalt thou go .
44:25:013:0	And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus .
44:25:014:0	And when they had been there many days , Festus declared Paul 's cause unto the king , saying , There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix :
44:25:015:0	About whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
44:25:016:0	To whom I answered , It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die , before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face , and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him .
44:25:017:0	Therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
44:25:018:0	Against whom when the accusers stood up , they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed :
44:25:019:0	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition , and of one Jesus , which was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be alive .
44:25:020:0	And because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
44:25:021:0	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus , I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar .
44:25:022:0	Then Agrippa said unto Festus , I would also hear the man myself . To morrow , said he , thou shalt hear him .
44:25:023:0	And on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
44:25:024:0	And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
44:25:025:0	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus , I have determined to send him .
44:25:026:0	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . Wherefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write .
44:25:027:0	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
