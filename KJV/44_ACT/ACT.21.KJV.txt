44:21:001:0	And it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto Coos , and the day following unto Rhodes , and from thence unto Patara :
44:21:002:0	And finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia , we went aboard , and set forth .
44:21:003:0	Now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
44:21:004:0	And finding disciples , we tarried there seven days : who said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
44:21:005:0	And when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
44:21:006:0	And when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
44:21:007:0	And when we had finished our course from Tyre , we came to Ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
44:21:008:0	And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
44:21:009:0	And the same man had four daughters , virgins , which did prophesy .
44:21:010:0	And as we tarried there many days , there came down from Judaea a certain prophet , named Agabus .
44:21:011:0	And when he was come unto us , he took Paul's girdle , and bound his own hands and feet , and said , Thus saith the Holy Ghost , So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle , and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles .
44:21:012:0	And when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44:21:013:0	Then Paul answered , What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart ? for I am ready not to be bound only , but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus .
44:21:014:0	And when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , The will of the Lord be done .
44:21:015:0	And after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to Jerusalem .
44:21:016:0	There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
44:21:017:0	And when we were come to Jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
44:21:018:0	And the day following Paul went in with us unto James ; and all the elders were present .
44:21:019:0	And when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry .
44:21:020:0	And when they heard it , they glorified the Lord , and said unto him , Thou seest , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law :
44:21:021:0	And they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
44:21:022:0	What is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
44:21:023:0	Do therefore this that we say to thee : We have four men which have a vow on them ;
44:21:024:0	Them take , and purify thyself with them , and be at charges with them , that they may shave their heads : and all may know that those things , whereof they were informed concerning thee , are nothing ; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly , and keepest the law .
44:21:025:0	As touching the Gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
44:21:026:0	Then Paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
44:21:027:0	And when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
44:21:028:0	Crying out , Men of Israel , help : This is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought Greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
44:21:029:0	( For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
44:21:030:0	And all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
44:21:031:0	And as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
44:21:032:0	Who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
44:21:033:0	Then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
44:21:034:0	And some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
44:21:035:0	And when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
44:21:036:0	For the multitude of the people followed after , crying , Away with him .
44:21:037:0	And as Paul was to be led into the castle , he said unto the chief captain , May I speak unto thee ? Who said , Canst thou speak Greek ?
44:21:038:0	Art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
44:21:039:0	But Paul said , I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , a citizen of no mean city : and , I beseech thee , suffer me to speak unto the people .
44:21:040:0	And when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . And when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
