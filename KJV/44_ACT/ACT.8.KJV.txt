44:8:001:0	And Saul was consenting unto his death . And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria , except the apostles .
44:8:002:0	And devout men carried Stephen to his burial , and made great lamentation over him .
44:8:003:0	As for Saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
44:8:004:0	Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
44:8:005:0	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ unto them .
44:8:006:0	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
44:8:007:0	For unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
44:8:008:0	And there was great joy in that city .
44:8:009:0	But there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
44:8:010:0	To whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is the great power of God .
44:8:011:0	And to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
44:8:012:0	But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
44:8:013:0	Then Simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with Philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
44:8:014:0	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
44:8:015:0	Who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Ghost :
44:8:016:0	( For as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
44:8:017:0	Then laid they their hands on them , and they received the Holy Ghost .
44:8:018:0	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money ,
44:8:019:0	Saying , Give me also this power , that on whomsoever I lay hands , he may receive the Holy Ghost .
44:8:020:0	But Peter said unto him , Thy money perish with thee , because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money .
44:8:021:0	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of God .
44:8:022:0	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray God , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
44:8:023:0	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity .
44:8:024:0	Then answered Simon , and said , Pray ye to the Lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
44:8:025:0	And they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
44:8:026:0	And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip , saying , Arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza , which is desert .
44:8:027:0	And he arose and went : and , behold , a man of Ethiopia , an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem for to worship ,
44:8:028:0	Was returning , and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet .
44:8:029:0	Then the Spirit said unto Philip , Go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
44:8:030:0	And Philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet Esaias , and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ?
44:8:031:0	And he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
44:8:032:0	The place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
44:8:033:0	In his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
44:8:034:0	And the eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
44:8:035:0	Then Philip opened his mouth , and began at the same scripture , and preached unto him Jesus .
44:8:036:0	And as they went on their way , they came unto a certain water : and the eunuch said , See , here is water ; what doth hinder me to be baptized ?
44:8:037:0	And Philip said , If thou believest with all thine heart , thou mayest . And he answered and said , I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God .
44:8:038:0	And he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
44:8:039:0	And when they were come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
44:8:040:0	But Philip was found at Azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to Caesarea .
