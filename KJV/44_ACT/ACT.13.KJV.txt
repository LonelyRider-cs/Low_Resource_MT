44:13:001:0	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44:13:002:0	As they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them .
44:13:003:0	And when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
44:13:004:0	So they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
44:13:005:0	And when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
44:13:006:0	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Barâ€“jesus :
44:13:007:0	Which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
44:13:008:0	But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
44:13:009:0	Then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
44:13:010:0	And said , O full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
44:13:011:0	And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
44:13:012:0	Then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord .
44:13:013:0	Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem .
44:13:014:0	But when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
44:13:015:0	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , Ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
44:13:016:0	Then Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , Men of Israel , and ye that fear God , give audience .
44:13:017:0	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .
44:13:018:0	And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
44:13:019:0	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
44:13:020:0	And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until Samuel the prophet .
44:13:021:0	And afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
44:13:022:0	And when he had removed him , he raised up unto them David to be their king ; to whom also he gave testimony , and said , I have found David the son of Jesse , a man after mine own heart , which shall fulfil all my will .
44:13:023:0	Of this man 's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour , Jesus :
44:13:024:0	When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44:13:025:0	And as John fulfilled his course , he said , Whom think ye that I am ? I am not he . But , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose .
44:13:026:0	Men and brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and whosoever among you feareth God , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
44:13:027:0	For they that dwell at Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
44:13:028:0	And though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain .
44:13:029:0	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
44:13:030:0	But God raised him from the dead :
44:13:031:0	And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
44:13:032:0	And we declare unto you glad tidings , how that the promise which was made unto the fathers ,
44:13:033:0	God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children , in that he hath raised up Jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee .
44:13:034:0	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , I will give you the sure mercies of David .
44:13:035:0	Wherefore he saith also in another psalm , Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
44:13:036:0	For David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
44:13:037:0	But he , whom God raised again , saw no corruption .
44:13:038:0	Be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
44:13:039:0	And by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
44:13:040:0	Beware therefore , lest that come upon you , which is spoken of in the prophets ;
44:13:041:0	Behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for I work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
44:13:042:0	And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue , the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
44:13:043:0	Now when the congregation was broken up , many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God .
44:13:044:0	And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God .
44:13:045:0	But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
44:13:046:0	Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles .
44:13:047:0	For so hath the Lord commanded us , saying , I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles , that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth .
44:13:048:0	And when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
44:13:049:0	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region .
44:13:050:0	But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
44:13:051:0	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto Iconium .
44:13:052:0	And the disciples were filled with joy , and with the Holy Ghost .
