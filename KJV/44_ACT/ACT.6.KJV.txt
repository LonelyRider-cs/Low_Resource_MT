44:6:001:0	And in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
44:6:002:0	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , It is not reason that we should leave the word of God , and serve tables .
44:6:003:0	Wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
44:6:004:0	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer , and to the ministry of the word .
44:6:005:0	And the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch :
44:6:006:0	Whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
44:6:007:0	And the word of God increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
44:6:008:0	And Stephen , full of faith and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
44:6:009:0	Then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the Libertines , and Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia and of Asia , disputing with Stephen .
44:6:010:0	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
44:6:011:0	Then they suborned men , which said , We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses , and against God .
44:6:012:0	And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
44:6:013:0	And set up false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law :
44:6:014:0	For we have heard him say , that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us .
44:6:015:0	And all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
