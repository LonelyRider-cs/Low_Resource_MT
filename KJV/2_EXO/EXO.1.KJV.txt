2:1:001:0	Now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
2:1:002:0	Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ,
2:1:003:0	Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ,
2:1:004:0	Dan , and Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
2:1:005:0	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
2:1:006:0	And Joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
2:1:007:0	And the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
2:1:008:0	Now there arose up a new king over Egypt , which knew not Joseph .
2:1:009:0	And he said unto his people , Behold , the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we :
2:1:010:0	Come on , let us deal wisely with them ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto our enemies , and fight against us , and so get them up out of the land .
2:1:011:0	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens . And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Rameses .
2:1:012:0	But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . And they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
2:1:013:0	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour :
2:1:014:0	And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in mortar , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
2:1:015:0	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
2:1:016:0	And he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
2:1:017:0	But the midwives feared God , and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the men children alive .
2:1:018:0	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
2:1:019:0	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh , Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are lively , and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them .
2:1:020:0	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
2:1:021:0	And it came to pass , because the midwives feared God , that he made them houses .
2:1:022:0	And Pharaoh charged all his people , saying , Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
