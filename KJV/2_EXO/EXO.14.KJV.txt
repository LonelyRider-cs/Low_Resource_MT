2:14:001:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
2:14:002:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , that they turn and encamp before Pi–hahiroth , between Migdol and the sea , over against Baal–zephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
2:14:003:0	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
2:14:004:0	And I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the . And they did so .
2:14:005:0	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled : and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ?
2:14:006:0	And he made ready his chariot , and took his people with him :
2:14:007:0	And he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .
2:14:008:0	And the hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
2:14:009:0	But the Egyptians pursued after them , all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , and his horsemen , and his army , and overtook them encamping by the sea , beside Pi–hahiroth , before Baal–zephon .
2:14:010:0	And when Pharaoh drew nigh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , behold , the Egyptians marched after them ; and they were sore afraid : and the children of Israel cried out unto the .
2:14:011:0	And they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
2:14:012:0	Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
2:14:013:0	And Moses said unto the people , Fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
2:14:014:0	The shall fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
2:14:015:0	And the said unto Moses , Wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward :
2:14:016:0	But lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
2:14:017:0	And I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
2:14:018:0	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
2:14:019:0	And the angel of God , which went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behind them :
2:14:020:0	And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
2:14:021:0	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
2:14:022:0	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
2:14:023:0	And the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
2:14:024:0	And it came to pass , that in the morning watch the looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,
2:14:025:0	And took off their chariot wheels , that they drave them heavily : so that the Egyptians said , Let us flee from the face of Israel ; for the fighteth for them against the Egyptians .
2:14:026:0	And the said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen .
2:14:027:0	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
2:14:028:0	And the waters returned , and covered the chariots , and the horsemen , and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them ; there remained not so much as one of them .
2:14:029:0	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
2:14:030:0	Thus the saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
2:14:031:0	And Israel saw that great work which the did upon the Egyptians : and the people feared the , and believed the , and his servant Moses .
