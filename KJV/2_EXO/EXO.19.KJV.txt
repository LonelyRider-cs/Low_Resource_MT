2:19:001:0	In the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
2:19:002:0	For they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
2:19:003:0	And Moses went up unto God , and the called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
2:19:004:0	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on eagles ' wings , and brought you unto myself .
2:19:005:0	Now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
2:19:006:0	And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
2:19:007:0	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the commanded him .
2:19:008:0	And all the people answered together , and said , All that the hath spoken we will do . And Moses returned the words of the people unto the .
2:19:009:0	And the said unto Moses , Lo , I come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and believe thee for ever . And Moses told the words of the people unto the .
2:19:010:0	And the said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
2:19:011:0	And be ready against the third day : for the third day the will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
2:19:012:0	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
2:19:013:0	There shall not an hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned , or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
2:19:014:0	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
2:19:015:0	And he said unto the people , Be ready against the third day : come not at your wives .
2:19:016:0	And it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled .
2:19:017:0	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
2:19:018:0	And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke , because the descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly .
2:19:019:0	And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voice .
2:19:020:0	And the came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
2:19:021:0	And the said unto Moses , Go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the to gaze , and many of them perish .
2:19:022:0	And let the priests also , which come near to the , sanctify themselves , lest the break forth upon them .
2:19:023:0	And Moses said unto the , The people can not come up to mount Sinai : for thou chargedst us , saying , Set bounds about the mount , and sanctify it .
2:19:024:0	And the said unto him , Away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the , lest he break forth upon them .
2:19:025:0	So Moses went down unto the people , and spake unto them .
