2:39:022:0	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work , all of blue .
2:39:023:0	And there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
2:39:024:0	And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined linen .
2:39:025:0	And they made bells of pure gold , and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe , round about between the pomegranates ;
2:39:026:0	A bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in ; as the commanded Moses .
2:39:027:0	And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron , and for his sons ,
2:39:028:0	And a mitre of fine linen , and goodly bonnets of fine linen , and linen breeches of fine twined linen ,
2:39:029:0	And a girdle of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , of needlework ; as the commanded Moses .
