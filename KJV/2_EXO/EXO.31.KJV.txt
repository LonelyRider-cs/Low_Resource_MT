2:31:001:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
2:31:002:0	See , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
2:31:003:0	And I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
2:31:004:0	To devise cunning works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
2:31:005:0	And in cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of timber , to work in all manner of workmanship .
2:31:006:0	And I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
2:31:007:0	The tabernacle of the congregation , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
2:31:008:0	And the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense ,
2:31:009:0	And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot ,
2:31:010:0	And the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office ,
2:31:011:0	And the anointing oil , and sweet incense for the holy place : according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do .
2:31:012:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
2:31:013:0	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the that doth sanctify you .
2:31:014:0	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
2:31:015:0	Six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
2:31:016:0	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
2:31:017:0	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
2:31:018:0	And he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
