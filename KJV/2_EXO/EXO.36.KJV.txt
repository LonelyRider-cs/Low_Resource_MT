2:36:001:0	Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whom the put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that the had commanded .
2:36:002:0	And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
2:36:003:0	And they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it withal . And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning .
2:36:004:0	And all the wise men , that wrought all the work of the sanctuary , came every man from his work which they made ;
2:36:005:0	And they spake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the commanded to make .
2:36:006:0	And Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . So the people were restrained from bringing .
2:36:007:0	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
2:36:008:0	And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work made he them .
2:36:009:0	The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were all of one size .
2:36:010:0	And he coupled the five curtains one unto another : and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
2:36:011:0	And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
2:36:012:0	Fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
2:36:013:0	And he made fifty taches of gold , and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches : so it became one tabernacle .
2:36:014:0	And he made curtains of goats ' hair for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
2:36:015:0	The length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain : the eleven curtains were of one size .
2:36:016:0	And he coupled five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves .
2:36:017:0	And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
2:36:018:0	And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
2:36:019:0	And he made a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers ' skins above that .
2:36:020:0	And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood , standing up .
2:36:021:0	The length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
2:36:022:0	One board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
2:36:023:0	And he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward :
2:36:024:0	And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
2:36:025:0	And for the other side of the tabernacle , which is toward the north corner , he made twenty boards ,
2:36:026:0	And their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
2:36:027:0	And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
2:36:028:0	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
2:36:029:0	And they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
2:36:030:0	And there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
2:36:031:0	And he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
2:36:032:0	And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
2:36:033:0	And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other .
2:36:034:0	And he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
2:36:035:0	And he made a veil of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubims made he it of cunning work .
2:36:036:0	And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
2:36:037:0	And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , of needlework ;
2:36:038:0	And the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
