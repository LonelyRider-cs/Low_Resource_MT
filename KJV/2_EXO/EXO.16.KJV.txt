2:16:001:0	And they took their journey from Elim , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
2:16:002:0	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness :
2:16:003:0	And the children of Israel said unto them , Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the flesh pots , and when we did eat bread to the full ; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
2:16:004:0	Then said the Lord unto Moses , Behold , I will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that I may prove them , whether they will walk in my law , or no .
2:16:005:0	And it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
2:16:006:0	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
2:16:007:0	And in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
2:16:008:0	And Moses said , This shall be , when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him : and what are we ? your murmurings are not against us , but against the Lord .
2:16:009:0	And Moses spake unto Aaron , Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , Come near before the Lord : for he hath heard your murmurings .
2:16:010:0	And it came to pass , as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
2:16:011:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
2:16:012:0	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel : speak unto them , saying , At even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God .
2:16:013:0	And it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
2:16:014:0	And when the dew that lay was gone up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar frost on the ground .
2:16:015:0	And when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is manna : for they wist not what it was . And Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat .
2:16:016:0	This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , Gather of it every man according to his eating , an omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
2:16:017:0	And the children of Israel did so , and gathered , some more , some less .
2:16:018:0	And when they did mete it with an omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
2:16:019:0	And Moses said , Let no man leave of it till the morning .
2:16:020:0	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
2:16:021:0	And they gathered it every morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
2:16:022:0	And it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
2:16:023:0	And he said unto them , This is that which the Lord hath said , To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord : bake that which ye will bake to day , and seethe that ye will seethe ; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning .
2:16:024:0	And they laid it up till the morning , as Moses bade : and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
2:16:025:0	And Moses said , Eat that to day ; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
2:16:026:0	Six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
2:16:027:0	And it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
2:16:028:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
2:16:029:0	See , for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
2:16:030:0	So the people rested on the seventh day .
2:16:031:0	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
2:16:032:0	And Moses said , This is the thing which the Lord commandeth , Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
2:16:033:0	And Moses said unto Aaron , Take a pot , and put an omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the Lord , to be kept for your generations .
2:16:034:0	As the Lord commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony , to be kept .
2:16:035:0	And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
2:16:036:0	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
