2:32:001:0	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount , the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron , and said unto him , Up , make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
2:32:002:0	And Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
2:32:003:0	And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
2:32:004:0	And he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
2:32:005:0	And when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the Lord .
2:32:006:0	And they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
2:32:007:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , Go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves :
2:32:008:0	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
2:32:009:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
2:32:010:0	Now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
2:32:011:0	And Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
2:32:012:0	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak , and say , For mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ? Turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
2:32:013:0	Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , thy servants , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto them , I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven , and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
2:32:014:0	And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people .
2:32:015:0	And Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
2:32:016:0	And the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , graven upon the tables .
2:32:017:0	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto Moses , There is a noise of war in the camp .
2:32:018:0	And he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I hear .
2:32:019:0	And it came to pass , as soon as he came nigh unto the camp , that he saw the calf , and the dancing : and Moses' anger waxed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount .
2:32:020:0	And he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
2:32:021:0	And Moses said unto Aaron , What did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them ?
2:32:022:0	And Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
2:32:023:0	For they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
2:32:024:0	And I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . So they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
2:32:025:0	And when Moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies : )
2:32:026:0	Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the Lord's side ? let him come unto me . And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
2:32:027:0	And he said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
2:32:028:0	And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
2:32:029:0	For Moses had said , Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
2:32:030:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin .
2:32:031:0	And Moses returned unto the Lord , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
2:32:032:0	Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sinâ€• ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
2:32:033:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
2:32:034:0	Therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
2:32:035:0	And the Lord plagued the people , because they made the calf , which Aaron made .
