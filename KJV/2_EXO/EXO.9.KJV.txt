2:9:001:0	Then the said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh , and tell him , Thus saith the God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
2:9:002:0	For if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still ,
2:9:003:0	Behold , the hand of the is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
2:9:004:0	And the shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
2:9:005:0	And the appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the shall do this thing in the land .
2:9:006:0	And the did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
2:9:007:0	And Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
2:9:008:0	And the said unto Moses and unto Aaron , Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh .
2:9:009:0	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
2:9:010:0	And they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast .
2:9:011:0	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils ; for the boil was upon the magicians , and upon all the Egyptians .
2:9:012:0	And the hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the had spoken unto Moses .
2:9:013:0	And the said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
2:9:014:0	For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
2:9:015:0	For now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
2:9:016:0	And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
2:9:017:0	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
2:9:018:0	Behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
2:9:019:0	Send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field , and shall not be brought home , the hail shall come down upon them , and they shall die .
2:9:020:0	He that feared the word of the among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
2:9:021:0	And he that regarded not the word of the left his servants and his cattle in the field .
2:9:022:0	And the said unto Moses , Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
2:9:023:0	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
2:9:024:0	So there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
2:9:025:0	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
2:9:026:0	Only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , was there no hail .
2:9:027:0	And Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , I have sinned this time : the is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
2:9:028:0	Entreat the ( for it is enough ) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
2:9:029:0	And Moses said unto him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands unto the ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the .
2:9:030:0	But as for thee and thy servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the God .
2:9:031:0	And the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
2:9:032:0	But the wheat and the rie were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
2:9:033:0	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
2:9:034:0	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
2:9:035:0	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the had spoken by Moses .
