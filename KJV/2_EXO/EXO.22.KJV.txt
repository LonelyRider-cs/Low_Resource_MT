2:22:001:0	If a man shall steal an ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
2:22:002:0	If a thief be found breaking up , and be smitten that he die , there shall no blood be shed for him .
2:22:003:0	If the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
2:22:004:0	If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
2:22:005:0	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten , and shall put in his beast , and shall feed in another man's field ; of the best of his own field , and of the best of his own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
2:22:006:0	If fire break out , and catch in thorns , so that the stacks of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consumed therewith ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
2:22:007:0	If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man's house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
2:22:008:0	If the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods .
2:22:009:0	For all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lost thing , which another challengeth to be his , the cause of both parties shall come before the judges ; and whom the judges shall condemn , he shall pay double unto his neighbour .
2:22:010:0	If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , no man seeing it :
2:22:011:0	Then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
2:22:012:0	And if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
2:22:013:0	If it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
2:22:014:0	And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof being not with it , he shall surely make it good .
2:22:015:0	But if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be an hired thing , it came for his hire .
2:22:016:0	And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife .
2:22:017:0	If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins .
2:22:018:0	Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .
2:22:019:0	Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
2:22:020:0	He that sacrificeth unto any god , save unto the Lord only , he shall be utterly destroyed .
2:22:021:0	Thou shalt neither vex a stranger , nor oppress him : for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .
2:22:022:0	Ye shall not afflict any widow , or fatherless child .
2:22:023:0	If thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto me , I will surely hear their cry ;
2:22:024:0	And my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
2:22:025:0	If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee , thou shalt not be to him as an usurer , neither shalt thou lay upon him usury .
2:22:026:0	If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge , thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down :
2:22:027:0	For that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
2:22:028:0	Thou shalt not revile the gods , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
2:22:029:0	Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
2:22:030:0	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
2:22:031:0	And ye shall be holy men unto me : neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ; ye shall cast it to the dogs .
