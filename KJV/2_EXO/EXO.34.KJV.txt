2:34:001:0	And the said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
2:34:002:0	And be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount .
2:34:003:0	And no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount .
2:34:004:0	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
2:34:005:0	And the descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the .
2:34:006:0	And the passed by before him , and proclaimed , The , The God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
2:34:007:0	Keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
2:34:008:0	And Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
2:34:009:0	And he said , If now I have found grace in thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee , go among us ; for it is a stiffnecked people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for thine inheritance .
2:34:010:0	And he said , Behold , I make a covenant : before all thy people I will do marvels , such as have not been done in all the earth , nor in any nation : and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the : for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee .
2:34:011:0	Observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
2:34:012:0	Take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
2:34:013:0	But ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their groves :
2:34:014:0	For thou shalt worship no other god : for the , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous God :
2:34:015:0	Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
2:34:016:0	And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
2:34:017:0	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
2:34:018:0	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep . Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month Abib : for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
2:34:019:0	All that openeth the matrix is mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that is male .
2:34:020:0	But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem . And none shall appear before me empty .
2:34:021:0	Six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
2:34:022:0	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year 's end .
2:34:023:0	Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord , the God of Israel .
2:34:024:0	For I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the thy God thrice in the year .
2:34:025:0	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
2:34:026:0	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the thy God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother 's milk .
2:34:027:0	And the said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
2:34:028:0	And he was there with the forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
2:34:029:0	And it came to pass , when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
2:34:030:0	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
2:34:031:0	And Moses called unto them ; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and Moses talked with them .
2:34:032:0	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
2:34:033:0	And till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
2:34:034:0	But when Moses went in before the to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out . And he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
2:34:035:0	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the veil upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
