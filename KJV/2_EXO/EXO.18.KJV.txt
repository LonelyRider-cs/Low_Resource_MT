2:18:001:0	When Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
2:18:002:0	Then Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took Zipporah , Moses ' wife , after he had sent her back ,
2:18:003:0	And her two sons ; of which the name of the one was Gershom ; for he said , I have been an alien in a strange land :
2:18:004:0	And the name of the other was Eliezer ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh :
2:18:005:0	And Jethro , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God :
2:18:006:0	And he said unto Moses , I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee , and thy wife , and her two sons with her .
2:18:007:0	And Moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
2:18:008:0	And Moses told his father in law all that the had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the delivered them .
2:18:009:0	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
2:18:010:0	And Jethro said , Blessed be the , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
2:18:011:0	Now I know that the is greater than all gods : for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them .
2:18:012:0	And Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father in law before God .
2:18:013:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
2:18:014:0	And when Moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
2:18:015:0	And Moses said unto his father in law , Because the people come unto me to enquire of God :
2:18:016:0	When they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
2:18:017:0	And Moses ' father in law said unto him , The thing that thou doest is not good .
2:18:018:0	Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
2:18:019:0	Hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : Be thou for the people to God-ward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God :
2:18:020:0	And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
2:18:021:0	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens :
2:18:022:0	And let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
2:18:023:0	If thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
2:18:024:0	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
2:18:025:0	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
2:18:026:0	And they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
2:18:027:0	And Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
