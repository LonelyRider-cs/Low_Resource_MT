2:15:001:0	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
2:15:002:0	The is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
2:15:003:0	The is a man of war : the is his name .
2:15:004:0	Pharaoh 's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea : his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea .
2:15:005:0	The depths have covered them : they sank into the bottom as a stone .
2:15:006:0	Thy right hand , O , is become glorious in power : thy right hand , O , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
2:15:007:0	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
2:15:008:0	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood upright as an heap , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea .
2:15:009:0	The enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them .
2:15:010:0	Thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea covered them : they sank as lead in the mighty waters .
2:15:011:0	Who is like unto thee , O , among the gods ? who is like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praises , doing wonders ?
2:15:012:0	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
2:15:013:0	Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
2:15:014:0	The people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Philistia .
2:15:015:0	Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
2:15:016:0	Fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , O , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
2:15:017:0	Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
2:15:018:0	The shall reign for ever and ever .
2:15:019:0	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
2:15:020:0	And Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
2:15:021:0	And Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
2:15:022:0	So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
2:15:023:0	And when they came to Marah , they could not drink of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter : therefore the name of it was called Marah .
2:15:024:0	And the people murmured against Moses , saying , What shall we drink ?
2:15:025:0	And he cried unto the ; and the shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
2:15:026:0	And said , If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the thy God , and wilt do that which is right in his sight , and wilt give ear to his commandments , and keep all his statutes , I will put none of these diseases upon thee , which I have brought upon the Egyptians : for I am the that healeth thee .
2:15:027:0	And they came to Elim , where were twelve wells of water , and threescore and ten palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
