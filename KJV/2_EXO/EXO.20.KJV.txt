2:20:001:0	And God spake all these words , saying ,
2:20:002:0	I am the thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
2:20:003:0	Thou shalt have no other gods before me .
2:20:004:0	Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
2:20:005:0	Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them : for I the thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ;
2:20:006:0	And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments .
2:20:007:0	Thou shalt not take the name of the thy God in vain ; for the will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
2:20:008:0	Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
2:20:009:0	Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
2:20:010:0	But the seventh day is the sabbath of the thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates :
2:20:011:0	For in six days the made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
2:20:012:0	Honour thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the thy God giveth thee .
2:20:013:0	Thou shalt not kill .
2:20:014:0	Thou shalt not commit adultery .
2:20:015:0	Thou shalt not steal .
2:20:016:0	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
2:20:017:0	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour 's .
2:20:018:0	And all the people saw the thunderings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood afar off .
2:20:019:0	And they said unto Moses , Speak thou with us , and we will hear : but let not God speak with us , lest we die .
2:20:020:0	And Moses said unto the people , Fear not : for God is come to prove you , and that his fear may be before your faces , that ye sin not .
2:20:021:0	And the people stood afar off , and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was .
2:20:022:0	And the said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
2:20:023:0	Ye shall not make with me gods of silver , neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold .
2:20:024:0	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings , and thy peace offerings , thy sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .
2:20:025:0	And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
2:20:026:0	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon .
