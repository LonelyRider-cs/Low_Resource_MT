2:40:001:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
2:40:002:0	On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
2:40:003:0	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony , and cover the ark with the veil .
2:40:004:0	And thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
2:40:005:0	And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
2:40:006:0	And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
2:40:007:0	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
2:40:008:0	And thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the hanging at the court gate .
2:40:009:0	And thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
2:40:010:0	And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering , and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar : and it shall be an altar most holy .
2:40:011:0	And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot , and sanctify it .
2:40:012:0	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
2:40:013:0	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
2:40:014:0	And thou shalt bring his sons , and clothe them with coats :
2:40:015:0	And thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
2:40:016:0	Thus did Moses : according to all that the commanded him , so did he .
2:40:017:0	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
2:40:018:0	And Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
2:40:019:0	And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the commanded Moses .
2:40:020:0	And he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark :
2:40:021:0	And he brought the ark into the tabernacle , and set up the veil of the covering , and covered the ark of the testimony ; as the commanded Moses .
2:40:022:0	And he put the table in the tent of the congregation , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the veil .
2:40:023:0	And he set the bread in order upon it before the ; as the had commanded Moses .
2:40:024:0	And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
2:40:025:0	And he lighted the lamps before the ; as the commanded Moses .
2:40:026:0	And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil :
2:40:027:0	And he burnt sweet incense thereon ; as the commanded Moses .
2:40:028:0	And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
2:40:029:0	And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the commanded Moses .
2:40:030:0	And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal .
2:40:031:0	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat :
2:40:032:0	When they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the commanded Moses .
2:40:033:0	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . So Moses finished the work .
2:40:034:0	Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation , and the glory of the filled the tabernacle .
2:40:035:0	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the filled the tabernacle .
2:40:036:0	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
2:40:037:0	But if the cloud were not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
2:40:038:0	For the cloud of the was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .
