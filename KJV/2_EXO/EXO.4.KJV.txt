2:4:001:0	And Moses answered and said , But , behold , they will not believe me , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , The hath not appeared unto thee .
2:4:002:0	And the said unto him , What is that in thine hand ? And he said , A rod .
2:4:003:0	And he said , Cast it on the ground . And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
2:4:004:0	And the said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . And he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
2:4:005:0	That they may believe that the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
2:4:006:0	And the said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosom . And he put his hand into his bosom : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
2:4:007:0	And he said , Put thine hand into thy bosom again . And he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
2:4:008:0	And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
2:4:009:0	And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
2:4:010:0	And Moses said unto the , O my Lord , I am not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
2:4:011:0	And the said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the ?
2:4:012:0	Now therefore go , and I will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
2:4:013:0	And he said , O my Lord , send , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
2:4:014:0	And the anger of the was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . And also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
2:4:015:0	And thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
2:4:016:0	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
2:4:017:0	And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do signs .
2:4:018:0	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law , and said unto him , Let me go , I pray thee , and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt , and see whether they be yet alive . And Jethro said to Moses , Go in peace .
2:4:019:0	And the said unto Moses in Midian , Go , return into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
2:4:020:0	And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
2:4:021:0	And the said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
2:4:022:0	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh , Thus saith the , Israel is my son , even my firstborn :
2:4:023:0	And I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
2:4:024:0	And it came to pass by the way in the inn , that the met him , and sought to kill him .
2:4:025:0	Then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
2:4:026:0	So he let him go : then she said , A bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
2:4:027:0	And the said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . And he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kissed him .
2:4:028:0	And Moses told Aaron all the words of the who had sent him , and all the signs which he had commanded him .
2:4:029:0	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel :
2:4:030:0	And Aaron spake all the words which the had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
2:4:031:0	And the people believed : and when they heard that the had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
