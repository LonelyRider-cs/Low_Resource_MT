2:12:001:0	And the spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying ,
2:12:002:0	This month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
2:12:003:0	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
2:12:004:0	And if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
2:12:005:0	Your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
2:12:006:0	And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
2:12:007:0	And they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
2:12:008:0	And they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
2:12:009:0	Eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
2:12:010:0	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
2:12:011:0	And thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the passover .
2:12:012:0	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the .
2:12:013:0	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt .
2:12:014:0	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
2:12:015:0	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
2:12:016:0	And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
2:12:017:0	And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
2:12:018:0	In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
2:12:019:0	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
2:12:020:0	Ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
2:12:021:0	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
2:12:022:0	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the basin , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
2:12:023:0	For the will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
2:12:024:0	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
2:12:025:0	And it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
2:12:026:0	And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ?
2:12:027:0	That ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smote the Egyptians , and delivered our houses . And the people bowed the head and worshipped .
2:12:028:0	And the children of Israel went away , and did as the had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
2:12:029:0	And it came to pass , that at midnight the smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
2:12:030:0	And Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
2:12:031:0	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the , as ye have said .
2:12:032:0	Also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
2:12:033:0	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
2:12:034:0	And the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
2:12:035:0	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
2:12:036:0	And the gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . And they spoiled the Egyptians .
2:12:037:0	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
2:12:038:0	And a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
2:12:039:0	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
2:12:040:0	Now the sojourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
2:12:041:0	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the went out from the land of Egypt .
2:12:042:0	It is a night to be much observed unto the for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
2:12:043:0	And the said unto Moses and Aaron , This is the ordinance of the passover : There shall no stranger eat thereof :
2:12:044:0	But every man 's servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
2:12:045:0	A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof .
2:12:046:0	In one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
2:12:047:0	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it .
2:12:048:0	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
2:12:049:0	One law shall be to him that is homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
2:12:050:0	Thus did all the children of Israel ; as the commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
2:12:051:0	And it came to pass the selfsame day , that the did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
