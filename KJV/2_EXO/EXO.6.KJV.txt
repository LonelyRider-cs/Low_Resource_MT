2:6:001:0	Then the Lord said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
2:6:002:0	And God spake unto Moses , and said unto him , I am the Lord :
2:6:003:0	And I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .
2:6:004:0	And I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
2:6:005:0	And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my covenant .
2:6:006:0	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel , I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will rid you out of their bondage , and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm , and with great judgments :
2:6:007:0	And I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
2:6:008:0	And I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord .

2:6:010:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
2:6:011:0	Go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .

2:6:028:0	And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt ,
2:6:029:0	That the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , I am the Lord : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
2:6:030:0	And Moses said before the Lord , Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ?
