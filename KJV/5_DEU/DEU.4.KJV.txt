5:4:001:0	Now therefore hearken , O Israel , unto the statutes and unto the judgments , which I teach you , for to do them , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you .
5:4:002:0	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
5:4:003:0	Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal–peor : for all the men that followed Baal–peor , the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you .
5:4:004:0	But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day .
5:4:005:0	Behold , I have taught you statutes and judgments , even as the Lord my God commanded me , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
5:4:006:0	Keep therefore and do them ; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations , which shall hear all these statutes , and say , Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people .
5:4:007:0	For what nation is there so great , who hath God so nigh unto them , as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for ?
5:4:008:0	And what nation is there so great , that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law , which I set before you this day ?
5:4:009:0	Only take heed to thyself , and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen , and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life : but teach them thy sons , and thy sons' sons ;
5:4:010:0	Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the Lord said unto me , Gather me the people together , and I will make them hear my words , that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth , and that they may teach their children .
5:4:011:0	And ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
5:4:012:0	And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
5:4:013:0	And he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
5:4:014:0	And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
5:4:015:0	Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire :
5:4:016:0	Lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image , the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
5:4:017:0	The likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air ,
5:4:018:0	The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth :
5:4:019:0	And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the stars , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be driven to worship them , and serve them , which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven .
5:4:020:0	But the Lord hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
5:4:021:0	Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance :
5:4:022:0	But I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
5:4:023:0	Take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee .
5:4:024:0	For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire , even a jealous God .
5:4:025:0	When thou shalt beget children , and children's children , and ye shall have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God , to provoke him to anger :
5:4:026:0	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong your days upon it , but shall utterly be destroyed .
5:4:027:0	And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the Lord shall lead you .
5:4:028:0	And there ye shall serve gods , the work of men's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
5:4:029:0	But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God , thou shalt find him , if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
5:4:030:0	When thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the Lord thy God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
5:4:031:0	( For the Lord thy God is a merciful God ; ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them .
5:4:032:0	For ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since the day that God created man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other , whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is , or hath been heard like it ?
5:4:033:0	Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
5:4:034:0	Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation , by temptations , by signs , and by wonders , and by war , and by a mighty hand , and by a stretched out arm , and by great terrors , according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes ?
5:4:035:0	Unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God ; there is none else beside him .
5:4:036:0	Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
5:4:037:0	And because he loved thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ;
5:4:038:0	To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
5:4:039:0	Know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the Lord he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
5:4:040:0	Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the Lord thy God giveth thee , for ever .
5:4:041:0	Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ;
5:4:042:0	That the slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
5:4:043:0	Namely , Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
5:4:044:0	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel :
5:4:045:0	These are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which Moses spake unto the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
5:4:046:0	On this side Jordan , in the valley over against Beth–peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote , after they were come forth out of Egypt :
5:4:047:0	And they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ;
5:4:048:0	From Aroer , which is by the bank of the river Arnon , even unto mount Sion , which is Hermon ,
5:4:049:0	And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of Pisgah .
