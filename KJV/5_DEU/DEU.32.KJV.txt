5:32:001:0	Give ear , O ye heavens , and I will speak ; and hear , O earth , the words of my mouth .
5:32:002:0	My doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
5:32:003:0	Because I will publish the name of the Lord : ascribe ye greatness unto our God .
5:32:004:0	He is the Rock , his work is perfect : for all his ways are judgment : a God of truth and without iniquity , just and right is he .
5:32:005:0	They have corrupted themselves , their spot is not the spot of his children : they are a perverse and crooked generation .
5:32:006:0	Do ye thus requite the Lord , O foolish people and unwise ? is not he thy father that hath bought thee ? hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
5:32:007:0	Remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations : ask thy father , and he will shew thee ; thy elders , and they will tell thee .
5:32:008:0	When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the sons of Adam , he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
5:32:009:0	For the Lord's portion is his people ; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
5:32:010:0	He found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
5:32:011:0	As an eagle stirreth up her nest , fluttereth over her young , spreadeth abroad her wings , taketh them , beareth them on her wings :
5:32:012:0	So the Lord alone did lead him , and there was no strange god with him .
5:32:013:0	He made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
5:32:014:0	Butter of kine , and milk of sheep , with fat of lambs , and rams of the breed of Bashan , and goats , with the fat of kidneys of wheat ; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape .
5:32:015:0	But Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
5:32:016:0	They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods , with abominations provoked they him to anger .
5:32:017:0	They sacrificed unto devils , not to God ; to gods whom they knew not , to new gods that came newly up , whom your fathers feared not .
5:32:018:0	Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful , and hast forgotten God that formed thee .
5:32:019:0	And when the Lord saw it , he abhorred them , because of the provoking of his sons , and of his daughters .
5:32:020:0	And he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
5:32:021:0	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities : and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
5:32:022:0	For a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
5:32:023:0	I will heap mischiefs upon them ; I will spend mine arrows upon them .
5:32:024:0	They shall be burnt with hunger , and devoured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction : I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the poison of serpents of the dust .
5:32:025:0	The sword without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hairs .
5:32:026:0	I said , I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men :
5:32:027:0	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the Lord hath not done all this .
5:32:028:0	For they are a nation void of counsel , neither is there any understanding in them .
5:32:029:0	O that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
5:32:030:0	How should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , except their Rock had sold them , and the Lord had shut them up ?
5:32:031:0	For their rock is not as our Rock , even our enemies themselves being judges .
5:32:032:0	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter :
5:32:033:0	Their wine is the poison of dragons , and the cruel venom of asps .
5:32:034:0	Is not this laid up in store with me , and sealed up among my treasures ?
5:32:035:0	To me belongeth vengeance , and recompence ; their foot shall slide in due time : for the day of their calamity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make haste .
5:32:036:0	For the Lord shall judge his people , and repent himself for his servants , when he seeth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
5:32:037:0	And he shall say , Where are their gods , their rock in whom they trusted ,
5:32:038:0	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
5:32:039:0	See now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
5:32:040:0	For I lift up my hand to heaven , and say , I live for ever .
5:32:041:0	If I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
5:32:042:0	I will make mine arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy .
5:32:043:0	Rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will avenge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be merciful unto his land , and to his people .
5:32:044:0	And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hoshea the son of Nun .
5:32:045:0	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel :
5:32:046:0	And he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
5:32:047:0	For it is not a vain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land , whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
5:32:048:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day , saying ,
5:32:049:0	Get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
5:32:050:0	And die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people ; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people :
5:32:051:0	Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribahâ€“kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
5:32:052:0	Yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
