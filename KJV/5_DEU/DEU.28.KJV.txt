5:28:001:0	And it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
5:28:002:0	And all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the thy God .
5:28:003:0	Blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .
5:28:004:0	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
5:28:005:0	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store .
5:28:006:0	Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
5:28:007:0	The shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
5:28:008:0	The shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the thy God giveth thee .
5:28:009:0	The shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the thy God , and walk in his ways .
5:28:010:0	And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
5:28:011:0	And the shall make thee plenteous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
5:28:012:0	The shall open unto thee his good treasure , the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season , and to bless all the work of thine hand : and thou shalt lend unto many nations , and thou shalt not borrow .
5:28:013:0	And the shall make thee the head , and not the tail ; and thou shalt be above only , and thou shalt not be beneath ; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the thy God , which I command thee this day , to observe and to do them :
5:28:014:0	And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
5:28:015:0	But it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
5:28:016:0	Cursed shalt thou be in the city , and cursed shalt thou be in the field .
5:28:017:0	Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store .
5:28:018:0	Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy land , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
5:28:019:0	Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
5:28:020:0	The shall send upon thee cursing , vexation , and rebuke , in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do , until thou be destroyed , and until thou perish quickly ; because of the wickedness of thy doings , whereby thou hast forsaken me .
5:28:021:0	The shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
5:28:022:0	The shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with an inflammation , and with an extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blasting , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
5:28:023:0	And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
5:28:024:0	The shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
5:28:025:0	The shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
5:28:026:0	And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air , and unto the beasts of the earth , and no man shall fray them away .
5:28:027:0	The will smite thee with the botch of Egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .
5:28:028:0	The shall smite thee with madness , and blindness , and astonishment of heart :
5:28:029:0	And thou shalt grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness , and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways : and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore , and no man shall save thee .
5:28:030:0	Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
5:28:031:0	Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
5:28:032:0	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
5:28:033:0	The fruit of thy land , and all thy labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
5:28:034:0	So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
5:28:035:0	The shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that can not be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
5:28:036:0	The shall bring thee , and thy king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known ; and there shalt thou serve other gods , wood and stone .
5:28:037:0	And thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nations whither the shall lead thee .
5:28:038:0	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
5:28:039:0	Thou shalt plant vineyards , and dress them , but shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grapes ; for the worms shall eat them .
5:28:040:0	Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
5:28:041:0	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into captivity .
5:28:042:0	All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume .
5:28:043:0	The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high ; and thou shalt come down very low .
5:28:044:0	He shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
5:28:045:0	Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , till thou be destroyed ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee :
5:28:046:0	And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
5:28:047:0	Because thou servedst not the thy God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things ;
5:28:048:0	Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
5:28:049:0	The shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ;
5:28:050:0	A nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young :
5:28:051:0	And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroyed : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flocks of thy sheep , until he have destroyed thee .
5:28:052:0	And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates , until thy high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all thy land : and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land , which the thy God hath given thee .
5:28:053:0	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
5:28:054:0	So that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
5:28:055:0	So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
5:28:056:0	The tender and delicate woman among you , which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness , her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom , and toward her son , and toward her daughter ,
5:28:057:0	And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet , and toward her children which she shall bear : for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates .
5:28:058:0	If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , THE THY GOD ;
5:28:059:0	Then the will make thy plagues wonderful , and the plagues of thy seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and sore sicknesses , and of long continuance .
5:28:060:0	Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
5:28:061:0	Also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
5:28:062:0	And ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the thy God .
5:28:063:0	And it shall come to pass , that as the rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
5:28:064:0	And the shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
5:28:065:0	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
5:28:066:0	And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of thy life :
5:28:067:0	In the morning thou shalt say , Would God it were even ! and at even thou shalt say , Would God it were morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
5:28:068:0	And the shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships , by the way whereof I spake unto thee , Thou shalt see it no more again : and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen , and no man shall buy you .
