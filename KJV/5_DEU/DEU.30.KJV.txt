5:30:001:0	And it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the thy God hath driven thee ,
5:30:002:0	And shalt return unto the thy God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thine heart , and with all thy soul ;
5:30:003:0	That then the thy God will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whither the thy God hath scattered thee .
5:30:004:0	If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the thy God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
5:30:005:0	And the thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
5:30:006:0	And the thy God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
5:30:007:0	And the thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
5:30:008:0	And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the , and do all his commandments which I command thee this day .
5:30:009:0	And the thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy land , for good : for the will again rejoice over thee for good , as he rejoiced over thy fathers :
5:30:010:0	If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
5:30:011:0	For this commandment which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it far off .
5:30:012:0	It is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
5:30:013:0	Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
5:30:014:0	But the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
5:30:015:0	See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
5:30:016:0	In that I command thee this day to love the thy God , to walk in his ways , and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments , that thou mayest live and multiply : and the thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
5:30:017:0	But if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
5:30:018:0	I denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land , whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it .
5:30:019:0	I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
5:30:020:0	That thou mayest love the thy God , and that thou mayest obey his voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto him : for he is thy life , and the length of thy days : that thou mayest dwell in the land which the sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give them .
