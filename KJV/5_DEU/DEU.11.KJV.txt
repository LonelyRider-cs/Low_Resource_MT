5:11:001:0	Therefore thou shalt love the thy God , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his judgments , and his commandments , alway .
5:11:002:0	And know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
5:11:003:0	And his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
5:11:004:0	And what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the hath destroyed them unto this day ;
5:11:005:0	And what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came into this place ;
5:11:006:0	And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben : how the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and their tents , and all the substance that was in their possession , in the midst of all Israel :
5:11:007:0	But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the which he did .
5:11:008:0	Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
5:11:009:0	And that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
5:11:010:0	For the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs :
5:11:011:0	But the land , whither ye go to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven :
5:11:012:0	A land which the thy God careth for : the eyes of the thy God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
5:11:013:0	And it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
5:11:014:0	That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil .
5:11:015:0	And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
5:11:016:0	Take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
5:11:017:0	And then the wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the giveth you .
5:11:018:0	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
5:11:019:0	And ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
5:11:020:0	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house , and upon thy gates :
5:11:021:0	That your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which the sware unto your fathers to give them , as the days of heaven upon the earth .
5:11:022:0	For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you , to do them , to love the your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ;
5:11:023:0	Then will the drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves .
5:11:024:0	Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be .
5:11:025:0	There shall no man be able to stand before you : for the your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
5:11:026:0	Behold , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse ;
5:11:027:0	A blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the your God , which I command you this day :
5:11:028:0	And a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
5:11:029:0	And it shall come to pass , when the thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
5:11:030:0	Are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the Canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal , beside the plains of Moreh ?
5:11:031:0	For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the your God giveth you , and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
5:11:032:0	And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day .
