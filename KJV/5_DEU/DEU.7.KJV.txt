5:7:001:0	When the thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and hath cast out many nations before thee , the Hittites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , seven nations greater and mightier than thou ;
5:7:002:0	And when the thy God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
5:7:003:0	Neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
5:7:004:0	For they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
5:7:005:0	But thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven images with fire .
5:7:006:0	For thou art an holy people unto the thy God : the thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
5:7:007:0	The did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
5:7:008:0	But because the loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
5:7:009:0	Know therefore that the thy God , he is God , the faithful God , which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ;
5:7:010:0	And repayeth them that hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be slack to him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
5:7:011:0	Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which I command thee this day , to do them .
5:7:012:0	Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers :
5:7:013:0	And he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee : he will also bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep , in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
5:7:014:0	Thou shalt be blessed above all people : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your cattle .
5:7:015:0	And the will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
5:7:016:0	And thou shalt consume all the people which the thy God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
5:7:017:0	If thou shalt say in thine heart , These nations are more than I ; how can I dispossess them ?
5:7:018:0	Thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the thy God did unto Pharaoh , and unto all Egypt ;
5:7:019:0	The great temptations which thine eyes saw , and the signs , and the wonders , and the mighty hand , and the stretched out arm , whereby the thy God brought thee out : so shall the thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid .
5:7:020:0	Moreover the thy God will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
5:7:021:0	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them : for the thy God is among you , a mighty God and terrible .
5:7:022:0	And the thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
5:7:023:0	But the thy God shall deliver them unto thee , and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction , until they be destroyed .
5:7:024:0	And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
5:7:025:0	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein : for it is an abomination to the thy God .
5:7:026:0	Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it : but thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; for it is a cursed thing .
