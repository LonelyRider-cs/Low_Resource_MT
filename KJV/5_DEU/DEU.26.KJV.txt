5:26:001:0	And it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
5:26:002:0	That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring of thy land that the thy God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place which the thy God shall choose to place his name there .
5:26:003:0	And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the thy God , that I am come unto the country which the sware unto our fathers for to give us .
5:26:004:0	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the thy God .
5:26:005:0	And thou shalt speak and say before the thy God , A Syrian ready to perish was my father , and he went down into Egypt , and sojourned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous :
5:26:006:0	And the Egyptians evil entreated us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage :
5:26:007:0	And when we cried unto the God of our fathers , the heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
5:26:008:0	And the brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders :
5:26:009:0	And he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
5:26:010:0	And now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O , hast given me . And thou shalt set it before the thy God , and worship before the thy God :
5:26:011:0	And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the thy God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
5:26:012:0	When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year , which is the year of tithing , and hast given it unto the Levite , the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , that they may eat within thy gates , and be filled ;
5:26:013:0	Then thou shalt say before the thy God , I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house , and also have given them unto the Levite , and unto the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me : I have not transgressed thy commandments , neither have I forgotten them :
5:26:014:0	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning , neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use , nor given ought thereof for the dead : but I have hearkened to the voice of the my God , and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me .
5:26:015:0	Look down from thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
5:26:016:0	This day the thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
5:26:017:0	Thou hast avouched the this day to be thy God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice :
5:26:018:0	And the hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments ;
5:26:019:0	And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the thy God , as he hath spoken .
