5:27:001:0	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people , saying , Keep all the commandments which I command you this day .
5:27:002:0	And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
5:27:003:0	And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over , that thou mayest go in unto the land which the thy God giveth thee , a land that floweth with milk and honey ; as the God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
5:27:004:0	Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaster them with plaster .
5:27:005:0	And there shalt thou build an altar unto the thy God , an altar of stones : thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
5:27:006:0	Thou shalt build the altar of the thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the thy God :
5:27:007:0	And thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the thy God .
5:27:008:0	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly .
5:27:009:0	And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel , saying , Take heed , and hearken , O Israel ; this day thou art become the people of the thy God .
5:27:010:0	Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
5:27:011:0	And Moses charged the people the same day , saying ,
5:27:012:0	These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
5:27:013:0	And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse ; Reuben , Gad , and Asher , and Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
5:27:014:0	And the Levites shall speak , and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice ,
