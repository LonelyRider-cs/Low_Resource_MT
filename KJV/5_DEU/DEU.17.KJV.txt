5:17:001:0	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock , or sheep , wherein is blemish , or any evilfavouredness : for that is an abomination unto the Lord thy God .
5:17:002:0	If there be found among you , within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy God , in transgressing his covenant ,
5:17:003:0	And hath gone and served other gods , and worshipped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which I have not commanded ;
5:17:004:0	And it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and enquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
5:17:005:0	Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that wicked thing , unto thy gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones , till they die .
5:17:006:0	At the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
5:17:007:0	The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . So thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
5:17:008:0	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within thy gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the Lord thy God shall choose ;
5:17:009:0	And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and enquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
5:17:010:0	And thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
5:17:011:0	According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
5:17:012:0	And the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
5:17:013:0	And all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
5:17:014:0	When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ;
5:17:015:0	Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the Lord thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
5:17:016:0	But he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
5:17:017:0	Neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
5:17:018:0	And it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
5:17:019:0	And it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
5:17:020:0	That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his children , in the midst of Israel .
