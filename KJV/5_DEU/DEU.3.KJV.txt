5:3:001:0	Then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
5:3:002:0	And the said unto me , Fear him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
5:3:003:0	So the our God delivered into our hands Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
5:3:004:0	And we took all his cities at that time , there was not a city which we took not from them , threescore cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
5:3:005:0	All these cities were fenced with high walls , gates , and bars ; beside unwalled towns a great many .
5:3:006:0	And we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon , utterly destroying the men , women , and children , of every city .
5:3:007:0	But all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
5:3:008:0	And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
5:3:009:0	( Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion ; and the Amorites call it Senir ; )
5:3:010:0	All the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salecah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
5:3:011:0	For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
5:3:012:0	And this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
5:3:013:0	And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
5:3:014:0	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi ; and called them after his own name , Bashan–havoth–jair , unto this day .
5:3:015:0	And I gave Gilead unto Machir .
5:3:016:0	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
5:3:017:0	The plain also , and Jordan , and the coast thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under Ashdoth–pisgah eastward .
5:3:018:0	And I commanded you at that time , saying , The your God hath given you this land to possess it : ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel , all that are meet for the war .
5:3:019:0	But your wives , and your little ones , and your cattle , ( for I know that ye have much cattle , ) shall abide in your cities which I have given you ;
5:3:020:0	Until the have given rest unto your brethren , as well as unto you , and until they also possess the land which the your God hath given them beyond Jordan : and then shall ye return every man unto his possession , which I have given you .
5:3:021:0	And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that the your God hath done unto these two kings : so shall the do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
5:3:022:0	Ye shall not fear them : for the your God he shall fight for you .
5:3:023:0	And I besought the at that time , saying ,
5:3:024:0	O Lord , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to thy works , and according to thy might ?
5:3:025:0	I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon .
5:3:026:0	But the was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me : and the said unto me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
5:3:027:0	Get thee up into the top of Pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes : for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
5:3:028:0	But charge Joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
5:3:029:0	So we abode in the valley over against Beth–peor .
