5:2:001:0	Then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
5:2:002:0	And the spake unto me , saying ,
5:2:003:0	Ye have compassed this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
5:2:004:0	And command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
5:2:005:0	Meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
5:2:006:0	Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
5:2:007:0	For the thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand : he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness : these forty years the thy God hath been with thee ; thou hast lacked nothing .
5:2:008:0	And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , through the way of the plain from Elath , and from Ezion–geber , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
5:2:009:0	And the said unto me , Distress not the Moabites , neither contend with them in battle : for I will not give thee of their land for a possession ; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession .
5:2:010:0	The Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ;
5:2:011:0	Which also were accounted giants , as the Anakims ; but the Moabites call them Emims .
5:2:012:0	The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime ; but the children of Esau succeeded them , when they had destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead ; as Israel did unto the land of his possession , which the gave unto them .
5:2:013:0	Now rise up , said I , and get you over the brook Zered . And we went over the brook Zered .
5:2:014:0	And the space in which we came from Kadesh–barnea , until we were come over the brook Zered , was thirty and eight years ; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host , as the sware unto them .
5:2:015:0	For indeed the hand of the was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed .
5:2:016:0	So it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
5:2:017:0	That the spake unto me , saying ,
5:2:018:0	Thou art to pass over through Ar , the coast of Moab , this day :
5:2:019:0	And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon , distress them not , nor meddle with them : for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession ; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession .
5:2:020:0	( That also was accounted a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in old time ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims ;
5:2:021:0	A people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ; but the destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead :
5:2:022:0	As he did to the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , when he destroyed the Horims from before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead even unto this day :
5:2:023:0	And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Gaza , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
5:2:024:0	Rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon : behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
5:2:025:0	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
5:2:026:0	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
5:2:027:0	Let me pass through thy land : I will go along by the high way , I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
5:2:028:0	Thou shalt sell me meat for money , that I may eat ; and give me water for money , that I may drink : only I will pass through on my feet ;
5:2:029:0	( As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir , and the Moabites which dwell in Ar , did unto me ; ) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the our God giveth us .
5:2:030:0	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him : for the thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
5:2:031:0	And the said unto me , Behold , I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit his land .
5:2:032:0	Then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at Jahaz .
5:2:033:0	And the our God delivered him before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
5:2:034:0	And we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
5:2:035:0	Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
5:2:036:0	From Aroer , which is by the brink of the river of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the our God delivered all unto us :
5:2:037:0	Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the our God forbad us .
