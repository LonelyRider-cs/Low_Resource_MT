5:21:001:0	If one be found slain in the land which the thy God giveth thee to possess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hath slain him :
5:21:002:0	Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
5:21:003:0	And it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
5:21:004:0	And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
5:21:005:0	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them the thy God hath chosen to minister unto him , and to bless in the name of the ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried :
5:21:006:0	And all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
5:21:007:0	And they shall answer and say , Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
5:21:008:0	Be merciful , O , unto thy people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel 's charge . And the blood shall be forgiven them .
5:21:009:0	So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the .
5:21:010:0	When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies , and the thy God hath delivered them into thine hands , and thou hast taken them captive ,
5:21:011:0	And seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto her , that thou wouldest have her to thy wife ;
5:21:012:0	Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
5:21:013:0	And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her , and shall remain in thine house , and bewail her father and her mother a full month : and after that thou shalt go in unto her , and be her husband , and she shall be thy wife .
5:21:014:0	And it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .
5:21:015:0	If a man have two wives , one beloved , and another hated , and they have born him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated :
5:21:016:0	Then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
5:21:017:0	But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
5:21:018:0	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
5:21:019:0	Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
5:21:020:0	And they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
5:21:021:0	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
5:21:022:0	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
5:21:023:0	His body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day ; ( for he that is hanged is accursed of God ; ) that thy land be not defiled , which the thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
