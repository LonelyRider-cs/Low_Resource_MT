5:6:001:0	Now these are the commandments , the statutes , and the judgments , which the Lord your God commanded to teach you , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it :
5:6:002:0	That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son's son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
5:6:003:0	Hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
5:6:004:0	Hear , O Israel : The Lord our God is one Lord :
5:6:005:0	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
5:6:006:0	And these words , which I command thee this day , shall be in thine heart :
5:6:007:0	And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
5:6:008:0	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes .
5:6:009:0	And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house , and on thy gates .
5:6:010:0	And it shall be , when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give thee great and goodly cities , which thou buildedst not ,
5:6:011:0	And houses full of all good things , which thou filledst not , and wells digged , which thou diggedst not , vineyards and olive trees , which thou plantedst not ; when thou shalt have eaten and be full ;
5:6:012:0	Then beware lest thou forget the Lord , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
5:6:013:0	Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and serve him , and shalt swear by his name .
5:6:014:0	Ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the people which are round about you ;
5:6:015:0	( For the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
5:6:016:0	Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God , as ye tempted him in Massah .
5:6:017:0	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
5:6:018:0	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers ,
5:6:019:0	To cast out all thine enemies from before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
5:6:020:0	And when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What mean the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which the Lord our God hath commanded you ?
5:6:021:0	Then thou shalt say unto thy son , We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt ; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand :
5:6:022:0	And the Lord shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
5:6:023:0	And he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
5:6:024:0	And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the Lord our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
5:6:025:0	And it shall be our righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God , as he hath commanded us .
