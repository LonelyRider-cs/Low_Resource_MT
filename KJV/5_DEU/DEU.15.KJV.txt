5:15:001:0	At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release .
5:15:002:0	And this is the manner of the release : Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the release .
5:15:003:0	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ;
5:15:004:0	Save when there shall be no poor among you ; for the shall greatly bless thee in the land which the thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it :
5:15:005:0	Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the thy God , to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day .
5:15:006:0	For the thy God blesseth thee , as he promised thee : and thou shalt lend unto many nations , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nations , but they shall not reign over thee .
5:15:007:0	If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother :
5:15:008:0	But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
5:15:009:0	Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart , saying , The seventh year , the year of release , is at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest him nought ; and he cry unto the against thee , and it be sin unto thee .
5:15:010:0	Thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the thy God shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
5:15:011:0	For the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
5:15:012:0	And if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
5:15:013:0	And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
5:15:014:0	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
5:15:015:0	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the thy God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
5:15:016:0	And it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ;
5:15:017:0	Then thou shalt take an awl , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
5:15:018:0	It shall not seem hard unto thee , when thou sendest him away free from thee ; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee , in serving thee six years : and the thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest .
5:15:019:0	All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the thy God : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
5:15:020:0	Thou shalt eat it before the thy God year by year in the place which the shall choose , thou and thy household .
5:15:021:0	And if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the thy God .
5:15:022:0	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the roebuck , and as the hart .
5:15:023:0	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
