5:20:001:0	When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
5:20:002:0	And it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
5:20:003:0	And shall say unto them , Hear , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
5:20:004:0	For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you .
5:20:005:0	And the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
5:20:006:0	And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
5:20:007:0	And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
5:20:008:0	And the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart .
5:20:009:0	And it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
5:20:010:0	When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
5:20:011:0	And it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
5:20:012:0	And if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
5:20:013:0	And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
5:20:014:0	But the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the Lord thy God hath given thee .
5:20:015:0	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
5:20:016:0	But of the cities of these people , which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
5:20:017:0	But thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee :
5:20:018:0	That they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the Lord your God .
5:20:019:0	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time , in making war against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them : for thou mayest eat of them , and thou shalt not cut them down ( for the tree of the field is man's life ) to employ them in the siege :
5:20:020:0	Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat , thou shalt destroy and cut them down ; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee , until it be subdued .
