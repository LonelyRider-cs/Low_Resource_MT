5:19:001:0	When the thy God hath cut off the nations , whose land the thy God giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
5:19:002:0	Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the thy God giveth thee to possess it .
5:19:003:0	Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
5:19:004:0	And this is the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ;
5:19:005:0	As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve , and lighteth upon his neighbour , that he die ; he shall flee unto one of those cities , and live :
5:19:006:0	Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer , while his heart is hot , and overtake him , because the way is long , and slay him ; whereas he was not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hated him not in time past .
5:19:007:0	Wherefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt separate three cities for thee .
5:19:008:0	And if the thy God enlarge thy coast , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers ;
5:19:009:0	If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them , which I command thee this day , to love the thy God , and to walk ever in his ways ; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee , beside these three :
5:19:010:0	That innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
5:19:011:0	But if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
5:19:012:0	Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
5:19:013:0	Thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with thee .
5:19:014:0	Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the thy God giveth thee to possess it .
5:19:015:0	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
5:19:016:0	If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
5:19:017:0	Then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the , before the priests and the judges , which shall be in those days ;
5:19:018:0	And the judges shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and hath testified falsely against his brother ;
5:19:019:0	Then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
5:19:020:0	And those which remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you .
5:19:021:0	And thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
