5:23:001:0	He that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the congregation of the .
5:23:002:0	A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the .
5:23:003:0	An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the for ever :
5:23:004:0	Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
5:23:005:0	Nevertheless the thy God would not hearken unto Balaam ; but the thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because the thy God loved thee .
5:23:006:0	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
5:23:007:0	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian ; because thou wast a stranger in his land .
5:23:008:0	The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the in their third generation .
5:23:009:0	When the host goeth forth against thine enemies , then keep thee from every wicked thing .
5:23:010:0	If there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
5:23:011:0	But it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
5:23:012:0	Thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
5:23:013:0	And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :
5:23:014:0	For the thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp , to deliver thee , and to give up thine enemies before thee ; therefore shall thy camp be holy : that he see no unclean thing in thee , and turn away from thee .
5:23:015:0	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee :
5:23:016:0	He shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates , where it liketh him best : thou shalt not oppress him .
5:23:017:0	There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel , nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
5:23:018:0	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the thy God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the thy God .
5:23:019:0	Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother ; usury of money , usury of victuals , usury of any thing that is lent upon usury :
5:23:020:0	Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
5:23:021:0	When thou shalt vow a vow unto the thy God , thou shalt not slack to pay it : for the thy God will surely require it of thee ; and it would be sin in thee .
5:23:022:0	But if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
5:23:023:0	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the thy God , which thou hast promised with thy mouth .
5:23:024:0	When thou comest into thy neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
5:23:025:0	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour 's standing corn .
