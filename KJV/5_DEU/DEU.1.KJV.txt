5:1:001:0	These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the Red sea , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
5:1:002:0	( There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh–barnea . )
5:1:003:0	And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them ;
5:1:004:0	After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei :
5:1:005:0	On this side Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying ,
5:1:006:0	The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount :
5:1:007:0	Turn you , and take your journey , and go to the mount of the Amorites , and unto all the places nigh thereunto , in the plain , in the hills , and in the vale , and in the south , and by the sea side , to the land of the Canaanites , and unto Lebanon , unto the great river , the river Euphrates .
5:1:008:0	Behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .
5:1:009:0	And I spake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone :
5:1:010:0	The Lord your God hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
5:1:011:0	( The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you ! )
5:1:012:0	How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
5:1:013:0	Take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tribes , and I will make them rulers over you .
5:1:014:0	And ye answered me , and said , The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do .
5:1:015:0	So I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
5:1:016:0	And I charged your judges at that time , saying , Hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between every man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him .
5:1:017:0	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment ; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment is God's : and the cause that is too hard for you , bring it unto me , and I will hear it .
5:1:018:0	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
5:1:019:0	And when we departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites , as the Lord our God commanded us ; and we came to Kadesh–barnea .
5:1:020:0	And I said unto you , Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which the Lord our God doth give unto us .
5:1:021:0	Behold , the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee : go up and possess it , as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee ; fear not , neither be discouraged .
5:1:022:0	And ye came near unto me every one of you , and said , We will send men before us , and they shall search us out the land , and bring us word again by what way we must go up , and into what cities we shall come .
5:1:023:0	And the saying pleased me well : and I took twelve men of you , one of a tribe :
5:1:024:0	And they turned and went up into the mountain , and came unto the valley of Eshcol , and searched it out .
5:1:025:0	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us .
5:1:026:0	Notwithstanding ye would not go up , but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God :
5:1:027:0	And ye murmured in your tents , and said , Because the Lord hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
5:1:028:0	Whither shall we go up ? our brethren have discouraged our heart , saying , The people is greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and walled up to heaven ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there .
5:1:029:0	Then I said unto you , Dread not , neither be afraid of them .
5:1:030:0	The Lord your God which goeth before you , he shall fight for you , according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes ;
5:1:031:0	And in the wilderness , where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until ye came into this place .
5:1:032:0	Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God ,
5:1:033:0	Who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
5:1:034:0	And the Lord heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and sware , saying ,
5:1:035:0	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land , which I sware to give unto your fathers ,
5:1:036:0	Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his children , because he hath wholly followed the Lord .
5:1:037:0	Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , saying , Thou also shalt not go in thither .
5:1:038:0	But Joshua the son of Nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
5:1:039:0	Moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
5:1:040:0	But as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
5:1:041:0	Then ye answered and said unto me , We have sinned against the Lord , we will go up and fight , according to all that the Lord our God commanded us . And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war , ye were ready to go up into the hill .
5:1:042:0	And the Lord said unto me , Say unto them , Go not up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest ye be smitten before your enemies .
5:1:043:0	So I spake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord , and went presumptuously up into the hill .
5:1:044:0	And the Amorites , which dwelt in that mountain , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and destroyed you in Seir , even unto Hormah .
5:1:045:0	And ye returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
5:1:046:0	So ye abode in Kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode there .
