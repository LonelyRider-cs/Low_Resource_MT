5:14:001:0	Ye are the children of the your God : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
5:14:002:0	For thou art an holy people unto the thy God , and the hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
5:14:003:0	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
5:14:004:0	These are the beasts which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
5:14:005:0	The hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamois .
5:14:006:0	And every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
5:14:007:0	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they are unclean unto you .
5:14:008:0	And the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh , nor touch their dead carcase .
5:14:009:0	These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fins and scales shall ye eat :
5:14:010:0	And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
5:14:011:0	Of all clean birds ye shall eat .
5:14:012:0	But these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
5:14:013:0	And the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after his kind ,
5:14:014:0	And every raven after his kind ,
5:14:015:0	And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
5:14:016:0	The little owl , and the great owl , and the swan ,
5:14:017:0	And the pelican , and the gier eagle , and the cormorant ,
5:14:018:0	And the stork , and the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
5:14:019:0	And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
5:14:020:0	But of all clean fowls ye may eat .
5:14:021:0	Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself : thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates , that he may eat it ; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien : for thou art an holy people unto the thy God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother 's milk .
5:14:022:0	Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
5:14:023:0	And thou shalt eat before the thy God , in the place which he shall choose to place his name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks ; that thou mayest learn to fear the thy God always .
5:14:024:0	And if the way be too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carry it ; or if the place be too far from thee , which the thy God shall choose to set his name there , when the thy God hath blessed thee :
5:14:025:0	Then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the thy God shall choose :
5:14:026:0	And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , for oxen , or for sheep , or for wine , or for strong drink , or for whatsoever thy soul desireth : and thou shalt eat there before the thy God , and thou shalt rejoice , thou , and thine household ,
5:14:027:0	And the Levite that is within thy gates ; thou shalt not forsake him ; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
5:14:028:0	At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
5:14:029:0	And the Levite , ( because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee , ) and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , which are within thy gates , shall come , and shall eat and be satisfied ; that the thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest .
