10:1:001:0	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had abode two days in Ziklag ;
10:1:002:0	It came even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent , and earth upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and did obeisance .
10:1:003:0	And David said unto him , From whence comest thou ? And he said unto him , Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped .
10:1:004:0	And David said unto him , How went the matter ? I pray thee , tell me . And he answered , That the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also .
10:1:005:0	And David said unto the young man that told him , How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead ?
10:1:006:0	And the young man that told him said , As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa , behold , Saul leaned upon his spear ; and , lo , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
10:1:007:0	And when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called unto me . And I answered , Here am I .
10:1:008:0	And he said unto me , Who art thou ? And I answered him , I am an Amalekite .
10:1:009:0	He said unto me again , Stand , I pray thee , upon me , and slay me : for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
10:1:010:0	So I stood upon him , and slew him , because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen : and I took the crown that was upon his head , and the bracelet that was on his arm , and have brought them hither unto my lord .
10:1:011:0	Then David took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
10:1:012:0	And they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
10:1:013:0	And David said unto the young man that told him , Whence art thou ? And he answered , I am the son of a stranger , an Amalekite .
10:1:014:0	And David said unto him , How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the anointed ?
10:1:015:0	And David called one of the young men , and said , Go near , and fall upon him . And he smote him that he died .
10:1:016:0	And David said unto him , Thy blood be upon thy head ; for thy mouth hath testified against thee , saying , I have slain the anointed .
10:1:017:0	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son :
10:1:018:0	( Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jasher . )
10:1:019:0	The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places : how are the mighty fallen !
10:1:020:0	Tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon ; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
10:1:021:0	Ye mountains of Gilboa , let there be no dew , neither let there be rain , upon you , nor fields of offerings : for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away , the shield of Saul , as though he had not been anointed with oil .
10:1:022:0	From the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of Jonathan turned not back , and the sword of Saul returned not empty .
10:1:023:0	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
10:1:024:0	Ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
10:1:025:0	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! O Jonathan , thou wast slain in thine high places .
10:1:026:0	I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : thy love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
10:1:027:0	How are the mighty fallen , and the weapons of war perished !
