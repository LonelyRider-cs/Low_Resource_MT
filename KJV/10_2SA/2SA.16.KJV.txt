10:16:001:0	And when David was a little past the top of the hill , behold , Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him , with a couple of asses saddled , and upon them two hundred loaves of bread , and an hundred bunches of raisins , and an hundred of summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
10:16:002:0	And the king said unto Ziba , What meanest thou by these ? And Ziba said , The asses be for the king's household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat ; and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink .
10:16:003:0	And the king said , And where is thy master's son ? And Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he abideth at Jerusalem : for he said , To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
10:16:004:0	Then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth . And Ziba said , I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
10:16:005:0	And when king David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and cursed still as he came .
10:16:006:0	And he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
10:16:007:0	And thus said Shimei when he cursed , Come out , come out , thou bloody man , and thou man of Belial :
10:16:008:0	The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
10:16:009:0	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
10:16:010:0	And the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah ? so let him curse , because the Lord hath said unto him , Curse David . Who shall then say , Wherefore hast thou done so ?
10:16:011:0	And David said to Abishai , and to all his servants , Behold , my son , which came forth of my bowels , seeketh my life : how much more now may this Benjamite do it ? let him alone , and let him curse ; for the Lord hath bidden him .
10:16:012:0	It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction , and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day .
10:16:013:0	And as David and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him , and cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
10:16:014:0	And the king , and all the people that were with him , came weary , and refreshed themselves there .
10:16:015:0	And Absalom , and all the people the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
10:16:016:0	And it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David's friend , was come unto Absalom , that Hushai said unto Absalom , God save the king , God save the king .
10:16:017:0	And Absalom said to Hushai , Is this thy kindness to thy friend ? why wentest thou not with thy friend ?
10:16:018:0	And Hushai said unto Absalom , Nay ; but whom the Lord , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
10:16:019:0	And again , whom should I serve ? should I not serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in thy father's presence , so will I be in thy presence .
10:16:020:0	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel , Give counsel among you what we shall do .
10:16:021:0	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom , Go in unto thy father's concubines , which he hath left to keep the house ; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father : then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong .
10:16:022:0	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house ; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
10:16:023:0	And the counsel of Ahithophel , which he counselled in those days , was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God : so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
