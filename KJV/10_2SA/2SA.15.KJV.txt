10:15:001:0	And it came to pass after this , that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses , and fifty men to run before him .
10:15:002:0	And Absalom rose up early , and stood beside the way of the gate : and it was so , that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment , then Absalom called unto him , and said , Of what city art thou ? And he said , Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel .
10:15:003:0	And Absalom said unto him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee .
10:15:004:0	Absalom said moreover , Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me , and I would do him justice !
10:15:005:0	And it was so , that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him .
10:15:006:0	And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
10:15:007:0	And it came to pass after forty years , that Absalom said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed unto the , in Hebron .
10:15:008:0	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , If the shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the .
10:15:009:0	And the king said unto him , Go in peace . So he arose , and went to Hebron .
10:15:010:0	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , Absalom reigneth in Hebron .
10:15:011:0	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem , that were called ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew not any thing .
10:15:012:0	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counsellor , from his city , even from Giloh , while he offered sacrifices . And the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Absalom .
10:15:013:0	And there came a messenger to David , saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom .
10:15:014:0	And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem , Arise , and let us flee ; for we shall not else escape from Absalom : make speed to depart , lest he overtake us suddenly , and bring evil upon us , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
10:15:015:0	And the king 's servants said unto the king , Behold , thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
10:15:016:0	And the king went forth , and all his household after him . And the king left ten women , which were concubines , to keep the house .
10:15:017:0	And the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tarried in a place that was far off .
10:15:018:0	And all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
10:15:019:0	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite , Wherefore goest thou also with us ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile .
10:15:020:0	Whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whither I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
10:15:021:0	And Ittai answered the king , and said , As the liveth , and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
10:15:022:0	And David said to Ittai , Go and pass over . And Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him .
10:15:023:0	And all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
10:15:024:0	And lo Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God : and they set down the ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
10:15:025:0	And the king said unto Zadok , Carry back the ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the , he will bring me again , and shew me both it , and his habitation :
10:15:026:0	But if he thus say , I have no delight in thee ; behold , here am I , let him do to me as seemeth good unto him .
10:15:027:0	The king said also unto Zadok the priest , Art not thou a seer ? return into the city in peace , and your two sons with you , Ahimaaz thy son , and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
10:15:028:0	See , I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness , until there come word from you to certify me .
10:15:029:0	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem : and they tarried there .
10:15:030:0	And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
10:15:031:0	And one told David , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . And David said , O , I pray thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness .
10:15:032:0	And it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
10:15:033:0	Unto whom David said , If thou passest on with me , then thou shalt be a burden unto me :
10:15:034:0	But if thou return to the city , and say unto Absalom , I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father 's servant hitherto , so will I now also be thy servant : then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel .
10:15:035:0	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
10:15:036:0	Behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
10:15:037:0	So Hushai David 's friend came into the city , and Absalom came into Jerusalem .
