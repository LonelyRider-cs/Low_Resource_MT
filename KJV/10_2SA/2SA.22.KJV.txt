10:22:001:0	And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
10:22:002:0	And he said , The Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ;
10:22:003:0	The God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
10:22:004:0	I will call on the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
10:22:005:0	When the waves of death compassed me , the floods of ungodly men made me afraid ;
10:22:006:0	The sorrows of hell compassed me about ; the snares of death prevented me ;
10:22:007:0	In my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried to my God : and he did hear my voice out of his temple , and my cry did enter into his ears .
10:22:008:0	Then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations of heaven moved and shook , because he was wroth .
10:22:009:0	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
10:22:010:0	He bowed the heavens also , and came down ; and darkness was under his feet .
10:22:011:0	And he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : and he was seen upon the wings of the wind .
10:22:012:0	And he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
10:22:013:0	Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled .
10:22:014:0	The Lord thundered from heaven , and the most High uttered his voice .
10:22:015:0	And he sent out arrows , and scattered them ; lightning , and discomfited them .
10:22:016:0	And the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
10:22:017:0	He sent from above , he took me ; he drew me out of many waters ;
10:22:018:0	He delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
10:22:019:0	They prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the Lord was my stay .
10:22:020:0	He brought me forth also into a large place : he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
10:22:021:0	The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
10:22:022:0	For I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
10:22:023:0	For all his judgments were before me : and as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
10:22:024:0	I was also upright before him , and have kept myself from mine iniquity .
10:22:025:0	Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness ; according to my cleanness in his eye sight .
10:22:026:0	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful , and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright .
10:22:027:0	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury .
10:22:028:0	And the afflicted people thou wilt save : but thine eyes are upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring them down .
10:22:029:0	For thou art my lamp , O Lord : and the Lord will lighten my darkness .
10:22:030:0	For by thee I have run through a troop : by my God have I leaped over a wall .
10:22:031:0	As for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all them that trust in him .
10:22:032:0	For who is God , save the Lord ? and who is a rock , save our God ?
10:22:033:0	God is my strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect .
10:22:034:0	He maketh my feet like hinds' feet : and setteth me upon my high places .
10:22:035:0	He teacheth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
10:22:036:0	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness hath made me great .
10:22:037:0	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me ; so that my feet did not slip .
10:22:038:0	I have pursued mine enemies , and destroyed them ; and turned not again until I had consumed them .
10:22:039:0	And I have consumed them , and wounded them , that they could not arise : yea , they are fallen under my feet .
10:22:040:0	For thou hast girded me with strength to battle : them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me .
10:22:041:0	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
10:22:042:0	They looked , but there was none to save ; even unto the Lord , but he answered them not .
10:22:043:0	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth , I did stamp them as the mire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
10:22:044:0	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people , thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
10:22:045:0	Strangers shall submit themselves unto me : as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto me .
10:22:046:0	Strangers shall fade away , and they shall be afraid out of their close places .
10:22:047:0	The Lord liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation .
10:22:048:0	It is God that avengeth me , and that bringeth down the people under me ,
10:22:049:0	And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
10:22:050:0	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O Lord , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto thy name .
10:22:051:0	He is the tower of salvation for his king : and sheweth mercy to his anointed , unto David , and to his seed for evermore .
