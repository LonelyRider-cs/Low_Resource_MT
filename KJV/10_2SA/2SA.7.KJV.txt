10:7:001:0	And it came to pass , when the king sat in his house , and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies ;
10:7:002:0	That the king said unto Nathan the prophet , See now , I dwell in an house of cedar , but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains .
10:7:003:0	And Nathan said to the king , Go , do all that is in thine heart ; for the Lord is with thee .
10:7:004:0	And it came to pass that night , that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan , saying ,
10:7:005:0	Go and tell my servant David , Thus saith the Lord , Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in ?
10:7:006:0	Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
10:7:007:0	In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel , whom I commanded to feed my people Israel , saying , Why build ye not me an house of cedar ?
10:7:008:0	Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel :
10:7:009:0	And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
10:7:010:0	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their own , and move no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more , as beforetime ,
10:7:011:0	And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house .
10:7:012:0	And when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
10:7:013:0	He shall build an house for my name , and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever .
10:7:014:0	I will be his father , and he shall be my son . If he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
10:7:015:0	But my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
10:7:016:0	And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee : thy throne shall be established for ever .
10:7:017:0	According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David .
10:7:018:0	Then went king David in , and sat before the Lord , and he said , Who am I , O Lord God ? and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
10:7:019:0	And this was yet a small thing in thy sight , O Lord God ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come . And is this the manner of man , O Lord God ?
10:7:020:0	And what can David say more unto thee ? for thou , Lord God , knowest thy servant .
10:7:021:0	For thy word's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all these great things , to make thy servant know them .
10:7:022:0	Wherefore thou art great , O Lord God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
10:7:023:0	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people , even like Israel , whom God went to redeem for a people to himself , and to make him a name , and to do for you great things and terrible , for thy land , before thy people , which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt , from the nations and their gods ?
10:7:024:0	For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever : and thou , Lord , art become their God .
10:7:025:0	And now , O Lord God , the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast said .
10:7:026:0	And let thy name be magnified for ever , saying , The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel : and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee .
10:7:027:0	For thou , O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , I will build thee an house : therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
10:7:028:0	And now , O Lord God , thou art that God , and thy words be true , and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant :
10:7:029:0	Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , O Lord God , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
