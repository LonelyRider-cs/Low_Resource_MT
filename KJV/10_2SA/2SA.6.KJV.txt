10:6:001:0	Again , David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel , thirty thousand .
10:6:002:0	And David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims .
10:6:003:0	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzza and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
10:6:004:0	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah , accompanying the ark of God : and Ahio went before the ark .
10:6:005:0	And David and all the house of Israel played before the on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals .
10:6:006:0	And when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzza put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
10:6:007:0	And the anger of the was kindled against Uzza ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God .
10:6:008:0	And David was displeased , because the had made a breach upon Uzza : and he called the name of the place Perez–uzzah to this day .
10:6:009:0	And David was afraid of the that day , and said , How shall the ark of the come to me ?
10:6:010:0	So David would not remove the ark of the unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed–edom the Gittite .
10:6:011:0	And the ark of the continued in the house of Obed–edom the Gittite three months : and the blessed Obed–edom , and all his household .
10:6:012:0	And it was told king David , saying , The hath blessed the house of Obed–edom , and all that pertaineth unto him , because of the ark of God . So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed–edom into the city of David with gladness .
10:6:013:0	And it was so , that when they that bare the ark of the had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
10:6:014:0	And David danced before the with all his might ; and David was girded with a linen ephod .
10:6:015:0	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
10:6:016:0	And as the ark of the came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the ; and she despised him in her heart .
10:6:017:0	And they brought in the ark of the , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the .
10:6:018:0	And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the of hosts .
10:6:019:0	And he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine . So all the people departed every one to his house .
10:6:020:0	Then David returned to bless his household . And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David , and said , How glorious was the king of Israel to day , who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants , as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself !
10:6:021:0	And David said unto Michal , It was before the , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the , over Israel : therefore will I play before the .
10:6:022:0	And I will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
10:6:023:0	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death .
