47:4:001:0	Therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ;
47:4:002:0	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God .
47:4:003:0	But if our gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost :
47:4:004:0	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
47:4:005:0	For we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake .
47:4:006:0	For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
47:4:007:0	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
47:4:008:0	We are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
47:4:009:0	Persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
47:4:010:0	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
47:4:011:0	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
47:4:012:0	So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
47:4:013:0	We having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
47:4:014:0	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
47:4:015:0	For all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God .
47:4:016:0	For which cause we faint not ; but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
47:4:017:0	For our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ;
47:4:018:0	While we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
