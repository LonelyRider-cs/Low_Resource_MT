47:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
47:1:002:0	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
47:1:003:0	Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
47:1:004:0	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
47:1:005:0	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
47:1:006:0	And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
47:1:007:0	And our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
47:1:008:0	For we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life :
47:1:009:0	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
47:1:010:0	Who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver : in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ;
47:1:011:0	Ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
47:1:012:0	For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
47:1:013:0	For we write none other things unto you , than what ye read or acknowledge ; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ;
47:1:014:0	As also ye have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus .
47:1:015:0	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ;
47:1:016:0	And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
47:1:017:0	When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
47:1:018:0	But as God is true , our word toward you was not yea and nay .
47:1:019:0	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and Silvanus and Timothy , was not yea and nay , but in him was yea .
47:1:020:0	For all the promises of God in him are yea , and in him Amen , unto the glory of God by us .
47:1:021:0	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ;
47:1:022:0	Who hath also sealed us , and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
47:1:023:0	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
47:1:024:0	Not for that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
