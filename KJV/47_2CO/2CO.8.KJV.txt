47:8:001:0	Moreover , brethren , we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia ;
47:8:002:0	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
47:8:003:0	For to their power , I bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
47:8:004:0	Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
47:8:005:0	And this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
47:8:006:0	Insomuch that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
47:8:007:0	Therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
47:8:008:0	I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
47:8:009:0	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
47:8:010:0	And herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
47:8:011:0	Now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
47:8:012:0	For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
47:8:013:0	For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened :
47:8:014:0	But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality :
47:8:015:0	As it is written , He that had gathered much had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little had no lack .
47:8:016:0	But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
47:8:017:0	For indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more forward , of his own accord he went unto you .
47:8:018:0	And we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
47:8:019:0	And not that only , but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord , and declaration of your ready mind :
47:8:020:0	Avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us :
47:8:021:0	Providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
47:8:022:0	And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
47:8:023:0	Whether any do enquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be enquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
47:8:024:0	Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
