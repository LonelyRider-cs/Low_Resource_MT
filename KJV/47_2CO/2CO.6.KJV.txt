47:6:001:0	We then , as workers together with him , beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain .
47:6:002:0	( For he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
47:6:003:0	Giving no offence in any thing , that the ministry be not blamed :
47:6:004:0	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
47:6:005:0	In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ;
47:6:006:0	By pureness , by knowledge , by longsuffering , by kindness , by the Holy Ghost , by love unfeigned ,
47:6:007:0	By the word of truth , by the power of God , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
47:6:008:0	By honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report : as deceivers , and yet true ;
47:6:009:0	As unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ;
47:6:010:0	As sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
47:6:011:0	O ye Corinthians , our mouth is open unto you , our heart is enlarged .
47:6:012:0	Ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your own bowels .
47:6:013:0	Now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
47:6:014:0	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?
47:6:015:0	And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
47:6:016:0	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
47:6:017:0	Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the Lord , and touch not the unclean thing ; and I will receive you ,
47:6:018:0	And will be a Father unto you , and ye shall be my sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty .
