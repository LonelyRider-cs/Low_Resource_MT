47:9:001:0	For as touching the ministering to the saints , it is superfluous for me to write to you :
47:9:002:0	For I know the forwardness of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
47:9:003:0	Yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
47:9:004:0	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
47:9:005:0	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before unto you , and make up beforehand your bounty , whereof ye had notice before , that the same might be ready , as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness .
47:9:006:0	But this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
47:9:007:0	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
47:9:008:0	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you ; that ye , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work :
47:9:009:0	( As it is written , He hath dispersed abroad ; he hath given to the poor : his righteousness remaineth for ever .
47:9:010:0	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
47:9:011:0	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to God .
47:9:012:0	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
47:9:013:0	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
47:9:014:0	And by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
47:9:015:0	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift .
