47:5:001:0	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , we have a building of God , an house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
47:5:002:0	For in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven :
47:5:003:0	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
47:5:004:0	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
47:5:005:0	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit .
47:5:006:0	Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord :
47:5:007:0	( For we walk by faith , not by sight : )
47:5:008:0	We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
47:5:009:0	Wherefore we labour , that , whether present or absent , we may be accepted of him .
47:5:010:0	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
47:5:011:0	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
47:5:012:0	For we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
47:5:013:0	For whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
47:5:014:0	For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
47:5:015:0	And that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
47:5:016:0	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
47:5:017:0	Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
47:5:018:0	And all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
47:5:019:0	To wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
47:5:020:0	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ 's stead , be ye reconciled to God .
47:5:021:0	For he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
