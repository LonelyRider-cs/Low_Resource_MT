47:3:001:0	Do we begin again to commend ourselves ? or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
47:3:002:0	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read of all men :
47:3:003:0	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
47:3:004:0	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward :
47:3:005:0	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
47:3:006:0	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
47:3:007:0	But if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
47:3:008:0	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious ?
47:3:009:0	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
47:3:010:0	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
47:3:011:0	For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
47:3:012:0	Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
47:3:013:0	And not as Moses , which put a veil over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
47:3:014:0	But their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which veil is done away in Christ .
47:3:015:0	But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the veil is upon their heart .
47:3:016:0	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord , the veil shall be taken away .
47:3:017:0	Now the Lord is that Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
47:3:018:0	But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
