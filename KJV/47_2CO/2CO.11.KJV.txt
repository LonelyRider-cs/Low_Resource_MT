47:11:001:0	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly : and indeed bear with me .
47:11:002:0	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
47:11:003:0	But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
47:11:004:0	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus , whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit , which ye have not received , or another gospel , which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
47:11:005:0	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles .
47:11:006:0	But though I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things .
47:11:007:0	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely ?
47:11:008:0	I robbed other churches , taking wages of them , to do you service .
47:11:009:0	And when I was present with you , and wanted , I was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied : and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will I keep myself .
47:11:010:0	As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
47:11:011:0	Wherefore ? because I love you not ? God knoweth .
47:11:012:0	But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
47:11:013:0	For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
47:11:014:0	And no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
47:11:015:0	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
47:11:016:0	I say again , Let no man think me a fool ; if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that I may boast myself a little .
47:11:017:0	That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
47:11:018:0	Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
47:11:019:0	For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
47:11:020:0	For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
47:11:021:0	I speak as concerning reproach , as though we had been weak . Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold , ( I speak foolishly , ) I am bold also .
47:11:022:0	Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they Israelites ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I .
47:11:023:0	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft .
47:11:024:0	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one .
47:11:025:0	Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
47:11:026:0	In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
47:11:027:0	In weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
47:11:028:0	Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
47:11:029:0	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is offended , and I burn not ?
47:11:030:0	If I must needs glory , I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities .
47:11:031:0	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
47:11:032:0	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me :
47:11:033:0	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall , and escaped his hands .
