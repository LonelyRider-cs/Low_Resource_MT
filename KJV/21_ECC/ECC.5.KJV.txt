21:5:001:0	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fools : for they consider not that they do evil .
21:5:002:0	Be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let thy words be few .
21:5:003:0	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business ; and a fool 's voice is known by multitude of words .
21:5:004:0	When thou vowest a vow unto God , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou hast vowed .
21:5:005:0	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
21:5:006:0	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it was an error : wherefore should God be angry at thy voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ?
21:5:007:0	For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities : but fear thou God .
21:5:008:0	If thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter : for he that is higher than the highest regardeth ; and there be higher than they .
21:5:009:0	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
21:5:010:0	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance with increase : this is also vanity .
21:5:011:0	When goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ?
21:5:012:0	The sleep of a labouring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
21:5:013:0	There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun , namely , riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt .
21:5:014:0	But those riches perish by evil travail : and he begetteth a son , and there is nothing in his hand .
21:5:015:0	As he came forth of his mother 's womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
21:5:016:0	And this also is a sore evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind ?
21:5:017:0	All his days also he eateth in darkness , and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness .
21:5:018:0	Behold that which I have seen : it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life , which God giveth him : for it is his portion .
21:5:019:0	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth , and hath given him power to eat thereof , and to take his portion , and to rejoice in his labour ; this is the gift of God .
21:5:020:0	For he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart .
