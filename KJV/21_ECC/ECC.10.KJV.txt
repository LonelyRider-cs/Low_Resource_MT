21:10:001:0	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
21:10:002:0	A wise man's heart is at his right hand ; but a fool's heart at his left .
21:10:003:0	Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
21:10:004:0	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy place ; for yielding pacifieth great offences .
21:10:005:0	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun , as an error which proceedeth from the ruler :
21:10:006:0	Folly is set in great dignity , and the rich sit in low place .
21:10:007:0	I have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking as servants upon the earth .
21:10:008:0	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh an hedge , a serpent shall bite him .
21:10:009:0	Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby .
21:10:010:0	If the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
21:10:011:0	Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment ; and a babbler is no better .
21:10:012:0	The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself .
21:10:013:0	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness : and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
21:10:014:0	A fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
21:10:015:0	The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them , because he knoweth not how to go to the city .
21:10:016:0	Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
21:10:017:0	Blessed art thou , O land , when thy king is the son of nobles , and thy princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
21:10:018:0	By much slothfulness the building decayeth ; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through .
21:10:019:0	A feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh merry : but money answereth all things .
21:10:020:0	Curse not the king , no not in thy thought ; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber : for a bird of the air shall carry the voice , and that which hath wings shall tell the matter .
