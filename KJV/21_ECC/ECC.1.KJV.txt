21:1:001:0	The words of the Preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem .
21:1:002:0	Vanity of vanities , saith the Preacher , vanity of vanities ; all is vanity .
21:1:003:0	What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun ?
21:1:004:0	One generation passeth away , and another generation cometh : but the earth abideth for ever .
21:1:005:0	The sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to his place where he arose .
21:1:006:0	The wind goeth toward the south , and turneth about unto the north ; it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again according to his circuits .
21:1:007:0	All the rivers run into the sea ; yet the sea is not full ; unto the place from whence the rivers come , thither they return again .
21:1:008:0	All things are full of labour ; man can not utter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
21:1:009:0	The thing that hath been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
21:1:010:0	Is there any thing whereof it may be said , See , this is new ? it hath been already of old time , which was before us .
21:1:011:0	There is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
21:1:012:0	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
21:1:013:0	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
21:1:014:0	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
21:1:015:0	That which is crooked can not be made straight : and that which is wanting can not be numbered .
21:1:016:0	I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
21:1:017:0	And I gave my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit .
21:1:018:0	For in much wisdom is much grief : and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
