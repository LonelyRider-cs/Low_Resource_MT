21:7:001:0	A good name is better than precious ointment ; and the day of death than the day of one's birth .
21:7:002:0	It is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
21:7:003:0	Sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
21:7:004:0	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
21:7:005:0	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
21:7:006:0	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
21:7:007:0	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad ; and a gift destroyeth the heart .
21:7:008:0	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof : and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
21:7:009:0	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry : for anger resteth in the bosom of fools .
21:7:010:0	Say not thou , What is the cause that the former days were better than these ? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this .
21:7:011:0	Wisdom is good with an inheritance : and by it there is profit to them that see the sun .
21:7:012:0	For wisdom is a defence , and money is a defence : but the excellency of knowledge is , that wisdom giveth life to them that have it .
21:7:013:0	Consider the work of God : for who can make that straight , which he hath made crooked ?
21:7:014:0	In the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider : God also hath set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
21:7:015:0	All things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
21:7:016:0	Be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
21:7:017:0	Be not over much wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
21:7:018:0	It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
21:7:019:0	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city .
21:7:020:0	For there is not a just man upon earth , that doeth good , and sinneth not .
21:7:021:0	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken ; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee :
21:7:022:0	For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
21:7:023:0	All this have I proved by wisdom : I said , I will be wise ; but it was far from me .
21:7:024:0	That which is far off , and exceeding deep , who can find it out ?
21:7:025:0	I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness :
21:7:026:0	And I find more bitter than death the woman , whose heart is snares and nets , and her hands as bands : whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her ; but the sinner shall be taken by her .
21:7:027:0	Behold , this have I found , saith the preacher , counting one by one , to find out the account :
21:7:028:0	Which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
21:7:029:0	Lo , this only have I found , that God hath made man upright ; but they have sought out many inventions .
