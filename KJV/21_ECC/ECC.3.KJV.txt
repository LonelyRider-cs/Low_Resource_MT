21:3:001:0	To every thing there is a season , and a time to every purpose under the heaven :
21:3:002:0	A time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
21:3:003:0	A time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
21:3:004:0	A time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
21:3:005:0	A time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
21:3:006:0	A time to get , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
21:3:007:0	A time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
21:3:008:0	A time to love , and a time to hate ; a time of war , and a time of peace .
21:3:009:0	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth ?
21:3:010:0	I have seen the travail , which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it .
21:3:011:0	He hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
21:3:012:0	I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life .
21:3:013:0	And also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of God .
21:3:014:0	I know that , whatsoever God doeth , it shall be for ever : nothing can be put to it , nor any thing taken from it : and God doeth it , that men should fear before him .
21:3:015:0	That which hath been is now ; and that which is to be hath already been ; and God requireth that which is past .
21:3:016:0	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity was there .
21:3:017:0	I said in mine heart , God shall judge the righteous and the wicked : for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work .
21:3:018:0	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
21:3:019:0	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea , they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast : for all is vanity .
21:3:020:0	All go unto one place ; all are of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
21:3:021:0	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
21:3:022:0	Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better , than that a man should rejoice in his own works ; for that is his portion : for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ?
