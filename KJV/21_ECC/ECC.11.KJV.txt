21:11:001:0	Cast thy bread upon the waters : for thou shalt find it after many days .
21:11:002:0	Give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
21:11:003:0	If the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
21:11:004:0	He that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
21:11:005:0	As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
21:11:006:0	In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
21:11:007:0	Truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun :
21:11:008:0	But if a man live many years , and rejoice in them all ; yet let him remember the days of darkness ; for they shall be many . All that cometh is vanity .
21:11:009:0	Rejoice , O young man , in thy youth ; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth , and walk in the ways of thine heart , and in the sight of thine eyes : but know thou , that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment .
21:11:010:0	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh : for childhood and youth are vanity .
