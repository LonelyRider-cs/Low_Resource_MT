40:2:001:0	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
40:2:002:0	Saying , Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
40:2:003:0	When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40:2:004:0	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
40:2:005:0	And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
40:2:006:0	And thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
40:2:007:0	Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
40:2:008:0	And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
40:2:009:0	When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
40:2:010:0	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
40:2:011:0	And when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
40:2:012:0	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
40:2:013:0	And when they were departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I bring thee word : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
40:2:014:0	When he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
40:2:015:0	And was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
40:2:016:0	Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men .
40:2:017:0	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
40:2:018:0	In Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
40:2:019:0	But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
40:2:020:0	Saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
40:2:021:0	And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
40:2:022:0	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
40:2:023:0	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
