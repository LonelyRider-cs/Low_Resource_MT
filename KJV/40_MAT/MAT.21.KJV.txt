40:21:001:0	And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then sent Jesus two disciples ,
40:21:002:0	Saying unto them , Go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
40:21:003:0	And if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
40:21:004:0	All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
40:21:005:0	Tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
40:21:006:0	And the disciples went , and did as Jesus commanded them ,
40:21:007:0	And brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
40:21:008:0	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
40:21:009:0	And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
40:21:010:0	And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
40:21:011:0	And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
40:21:012:0	And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
40:21:013:0	And said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
40:21:014:0	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
40:21:015:0	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David ; they were sore displeased ,
40:21:016:0	And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
40:21:017:0	And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
40:21:018:0	Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
40:21:019:0	And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away .
40:21:020:0	And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away !
40:21:021:0	Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
40:21:022:0	And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
40:21:023:0	And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
40:21:024:0	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
40:21:025:0	The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
40:21:026:0	But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
40:21:027:0	And they answered Jesus , and said , We cannot tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
40:21:028:0	But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard .
40:21:029:0	He answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
40:21:030:0	And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not .
40:21:031:0	Whether of them twain did the will of his father ? They say unto him , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
40:21:032:0	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
40:21:033:0	Hear another parable : There was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country :
40:21:034:0	And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
40:21:035:0	And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
40:21:036:0	Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
40:21:037:0	But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
40:21:038:0	But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
40:21:039:0	And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
40:21:040:0	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
40:21:041:0	They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
40:21:042:0	Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
40:21:043:0	Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
40:21:044:0	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
40:21:045:0	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
40:21:046:0	But when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet .
