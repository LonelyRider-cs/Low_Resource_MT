40:24:001:0	And Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
40:24:002:0	And Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
40:24:003:0	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
40:24:004:0	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Take heed that no man deceive you .
40:24:005:0	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
40:24:006:0	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
40:24:007:0	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
40:24:008:0	All these are the beginning of sorrows .
40:24:009:0	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
40:24:010:0	And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
40:24:011:0	And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
40:24:012:0	And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
40:24:013:0	But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
40:24:014:0	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
40:24:015:0	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
40:24:016:0	Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains :
40:24:017:0	Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
40:24:018:0	Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
40:24:019:0	And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
40:24:020:0	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
40:24:021:0	For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
40:24:022:0	And except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened .
40:24:023:0	Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is Christ , or there ; believe it not .
40:24:024:0	For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
40:24:025:0	Behold , I have told you before .
40:24:026:0	Wherefore if they shall say unto you , Behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
40:24:027:0	For as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
40:24:028:0	For wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
40:24:029:0	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
40:24:030:0	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40:24:031:0	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
40:24:032:0	Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
40:24:033:0	So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
40:24:034:0	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
40:24:035:0	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
40:24:036:0	But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
40:24:037:0	But as the days of Noah were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
40:24:038:0	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark ,
40:24:039:0	And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
40:24:040:0	Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
40:24:041:0	Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
40:24:042:0	Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
40:24:043:0	But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
40:24:044:0	Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
40:24:045:0	Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
40:24:046:0	Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
40:24:047:0	Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
40:24:048:0	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ;
40:24:049:0	And shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
40:24:050:0	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
40:24:051:0	And shall cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
