40:10:001:0	And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
40:10:002:0	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
40:10:003:0	Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
40:10:004:0	Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
40:10:005:0	These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
40:10:006:0	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40:10:007:0	And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40:10:008:0	Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
40:10:009:0	Provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
40:10:010:0	Nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
40:10:011:0	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , enquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
40:10:012:0	And when ye come into an house , salute it .
40:10:013:0	And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
40:10:014:0	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
40:10:015:0	Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
40:10:016:0	Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
40:10:017:0	But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
40:10:018:0	And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
40:10:019:0	But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
40:10:020:0	For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
40:10:021:0	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
40:10:022:0	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
40:10:023:0	But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
40:10:024:0	The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
40:10:025:0	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
40:10:026:0	Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
40:10:027:0	What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
40:10:028:0	And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
40:10:029:0	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
40:10:030:0	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
40:10:031:0	Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
40:10:032:0	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven .
40:10:033:0	But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven .
40:10:034:0	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
40:10:035:0	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
40:10:036:0	And a man's foes shall be they of his own household .
40:10:037:0	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
40:10:038:0	And he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
40:10:039:0	He that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
40:10:040:0	He that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
40:10:041:0	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward .
40:10:042:0	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
