40:11:001:0	And it came to pass , when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
40:11:002:0	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
40:11:003:0	And said unto him , Art thou he that should come , or do we look for another ?
40:11:004:0	Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see :
40:11:005:0	The blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
40:11:006:0	And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
40:11:007:0	And as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
40:11:008:0	But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
40:11:009:0	But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
40:11:010:0	For this is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
40:11:011:0	Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40:11:012:0	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
40:11:013:0	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
40:11:014:0	And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
40:11:015:0	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
40:11:016:0	But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
40:11:017:0	And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
40:11:018:0	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil .
40:11:019:0	The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is justified of her children .
40:11:020:0	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
40:11:021:0	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40:11:022:0	But I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
40:11:023:0	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
40:11:024:0	But I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
40:11:025:0	At that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
40:11:026:0	Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
40:11:027:0	All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
40:11:028:0	Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
40:11:029:0	Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
40:11:030:0	For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
