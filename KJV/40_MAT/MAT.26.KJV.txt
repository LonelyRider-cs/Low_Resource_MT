40:26:001:0	And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said unto his disciples ,
40:26:002:0	Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
40:26:003:0	Then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
40:26:004:0	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
40:26:005:0	But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
40:26:006:0	Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
40:26:007:0	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
40:26:008:0	But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
40:26:009:0	For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
40:26:010:0	When Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
40:26:011:0	For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
40:26:012:0	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
40:26:013:0	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
40:26:014:0	Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
40:26:015:0	And said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
40:26:016:0	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
40:26:017:0	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
40:26:018:0	And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
40:26:019:0	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
40:26:020:0	Now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
40:26:021:0	And as they did eat , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
40:26:022:0	And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , Lord , is it I ?
40:26:023:0	And he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
40:26:024:0	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
40:26:025:0	Then Judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , Master , is it I ? He said unto him , Thou hast said .
40:26:026:0	And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
40:26:027:0	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
40:26:028:0	For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
40:26:029:0	But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom .
40:26:030:0	And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
40:26:031:0	Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
40:26:032:0	But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
40:26:033:0	Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
40:26:034:0	Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
40:26:035:0	Peter said unto him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
40:26:036:0	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , Sit ye here , while I go and pray yonder .
40:26:037:0	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
40:26:038:0	Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
40:26:039:0	And he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt .
40:26:040:0	And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
40:26:041:0	Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
40:26:042:0	He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done .
40:26:043:0	And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
40:26:044:0	And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
40:26:045:0	Then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40:26:046:0	Rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
40:26:047:0	And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
40:26:048:0	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
40:26:049:0	And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , master ; and kissed him .
40:26:050:0	And Jesus said unto him , Friend , wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
40:26:051:0	And , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest's , and smote off his ear .
40:26:052:0	Then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
40:26:053:0	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
40:26:054:0	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
40:26:055:0	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
40:26:056:0	But all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
40:26:057:0	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
40:26:058:0	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
40:26:059:0	Now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
40:26:060:0	But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
40:26:061:0	And said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
40:26:062:0	And the high priest arose , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
40:26:063:0	But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest answered and said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God .
40:26:064:0	Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
40:26:065:0	Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
40:26:066:0	What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death .
40:26:067:0	Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
40:26:068:0	Saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ?
40:26:069:0	Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee .
40:26:070:0	But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest .
40:26:071:0	And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
40:26:072:0	And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man .
40:26:073:0	And after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
40:26:074:0	Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew .
40:26:075:0	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly .
