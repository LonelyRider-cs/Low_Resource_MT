40:15:001:0	Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees , which were of Jerusalem , saying ,
40:15:002:0	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
40:15:003:0	But he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
40:15:004:0	For God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
40:15:005:0	But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
40:15:006:0	And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
40:15:007:0	Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
40:15:008:0	This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
40:15:009:0	But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
40:15:010:0	And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand :
40:15:011:0	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
40:15:012:0	Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
40:15:013:0	But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
40:15:014:0	Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
40:15:015:0	Then answered Peter and said unto him , Declare unto us this parable .
40:15:016:0	And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
40:15:017:0	Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
40:15:018:0	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
40:15:019:0	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
40:15:020:0	These are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
40:15:021:0	Then Jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
40:15:022:0	And , behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts , and cried unto him , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou Son of David ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil .
40:15:023:0	But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us .
40:15:024:0	But he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40:15:025:0	Then came she and worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me .
40:15:026:0	But he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to dogs .
40:15:027:0	And she said , Truth , Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table .
40:15:028:0	Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
40:15:029:0	And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
40:15:030:0	And great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
40:15:031:0	Insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
40:15:032:0	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
40:15:033:0	And his disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
40:15:034:0	And Jesus saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes .
40:15:035:0	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
40:15:036:0	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
40:15:037:0	And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
40:15:038:0	And they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
40:15:039:0	And he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of Magdala .
