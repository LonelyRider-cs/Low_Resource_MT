40:25:001:0	Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
40:25:002:0	And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
40:25:003:0	They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
40:25:004:0	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
40:25:005:0	While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
40:25:006:0	And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
40:25:007:0	Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
40:25:008:0	And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
40:25:009:0	But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
40:25:010:0	And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
40:25:011:0	Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us .
40:25:012:0	But he answered and said , Verily I say unto you , I know you not .
40:25:013:0	Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh .
40:25:014:0	For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
40:25:015:0	And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
40:25:016:0	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
40:25:017:0	And likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
40:25:018:0	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord's money .
40:25:019:0	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them .
40:25:020:0	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
40:25:021:0	His lord said unto him , Well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
40:25:022:0	He also that had received two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , I have gained two other talents beside them .
40:25:023:0	His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
40:25:024:0	Then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
40:25:025:0	And I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
40:25:026:0	His lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I have not strawed :
40:25:027:0	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
40:25:028:0	Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
40:25:029:0	For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
40:25:030:0	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:25:031:0	When the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
40:25:032:0	And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
40:25:033:0	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
40:25:034:0	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
40:25:035:0	For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
40:25:036:0	Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
40:25:037:0	Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
40:25:038:0	When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
40:25:039:0	Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
40:25:040:0	And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
40:25:041:0	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
40:25:042:0	For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
40:25:043:0	I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
40:25:044:0	Then shall they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
40:25:045:0	Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
40:25:046:0	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment : but the righteous into life eternal .
