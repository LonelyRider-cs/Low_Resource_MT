40:7:001:0	Judge not , that ye be not judged .
40:7:002:0	For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
40:7:003:0	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
40:7:004:0	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
40:7:005:0	Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye .
40:7:006:0	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
40:7:007:0	Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
40:7:008:0	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
40:7:009:0	Or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
40:7:010:0	Or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
40:7:011:0	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
40:7:012:0	Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
40:7:013:0	Enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
40:7:014:0	Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
40:7:015:0	Beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep's clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
40:7:016:0	Ye shall know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
40:7:017:0	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
40:7:018:0	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
40:7:019:0	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
40:7:020:0	Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
40:7:021:0	Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
40:7:022:0	Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
40:7:023:0	And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
40:7:024:0	Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
40:7:025:0	And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
40:7:026:0	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
40:7:027:0	And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
40:7:028:0	And it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
40:7:029:0	For he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
