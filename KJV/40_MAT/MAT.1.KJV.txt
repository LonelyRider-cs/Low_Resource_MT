40:1:001:0	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
40:1:002:0	Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren ;
40:1:003:0	And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ;
40:1:004:0	And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ;
40:1:005:0	And Salmon begat Booz of Rahab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ;
40:1:006:0	And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ;
40:1:007:0	And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ;
40:1:008:0	And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ;
40:1:009:0	And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ;
40:1:010:0	And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ;
40:1:011:0	And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon :
40:1:012:0	And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ;
40:1:013:0	And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ;
40:1:014:0	And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ;
40:1:015:0	And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ;
40:1:016:0	And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
40:1:017:0	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
40:1:018:0	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
40:1:019:0	Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
40:1:020:0	But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
40:1:021:0	And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins .
40:1:022:0	Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
40:1:023:0	Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us .
40:1:024:0	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
40:1:025:0	And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name JESUS .
