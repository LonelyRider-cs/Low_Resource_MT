40:8:001:0	When he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
40:8:002:0	And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
40:8:003:0	And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40:8:004:0	And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
40:8:005:0	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
40:8:006:0	And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
40:8:007:0	And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
40:8:008:0	The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
40:8:009:0	For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
40:8:010:0	When Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
40:8:011:0	And I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
40:8:012:0	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:8:013:0	And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
40:8:014:0	And when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick of a fever .
40:8:015:0	And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
40:8:016:0	When the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
40:8:017:0	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses .
40:8:018:0	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
40:8:019:0	And a certain scribe came , and said unto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
40:8:020:0	And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
40:8:021:0	And another of his disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
40:8:022:0	But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .
40:8:023:0	And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
40:8:024:0	And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
40:8:025:0	And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish .
40:8:026:0	And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
40:8:027:0	But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
40:8:028:0	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
40:8:029:0	And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
40:8:030:0	And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
40:8:031:0	So the devils besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
40:8:032:0	And he said unto them , Go . And when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
40:8:033:0	And they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
40:8:034:0	And , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
