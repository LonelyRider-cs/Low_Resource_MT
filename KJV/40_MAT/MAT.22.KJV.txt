40:22:001:0	And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables , and said ,
40:22:002:0	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son ,
40:22:003:0	And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
40:22:004:0	Again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
40:22:005:0	But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
40:22:006:0	And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
40:22:007:0	But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
40:22:008:0	Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
40:22:009:0	Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
40:22:010:0	So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
40:22:011:0	And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
40:22:012:0	And he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? And he was speechless .
40:22:013:0	Then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40:22:014:0	For many are called , but few are chosen .
40:22:015:0	Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
40:22:016:0	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
40:22:017:0	Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
40:22:018:0	But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
40:22:019:0	Shew me the tribute money . And they brought unto him a penny .
40:22:020:0	And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
40:22:021:0	They say unto him , Caesar's . Then saith he unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's ; and unto God the things that are God's .
40:22:022:0	When they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
40:22:023:0	The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
40:22:024:0	Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
40:22:025:0	Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
40:22:026:0	Likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
40:22:027:0	And last of all the woman died also .
40:22:028:0	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
40:22:029:0	Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
40:22:030:0	For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
40:22:031:0	But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
40:22:032:0	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
40:22:033:0	And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
40:22:034:0	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
40:22:035:0	Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
40:22:036:0	Master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
40:22:037:0	Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
40:22:038:0	This is the first and great commandment .
40:22:039:0	And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
40:22:040:0	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets .
40:22:041:0	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
40:22:042:0	Saying , What think ye of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him , The Son of David .
40:22:043:0	He saith unto them , How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying ,
40:22:044:0	The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
40:22:045:0	If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ?
40:22:046:0	And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
