40:9:001:0	And he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
40:9:002:0	And , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
40:9:003:0	And , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .
40:9:004:0	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
40:9:005:0	For whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
40:9:006:0	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
40:9:007:0	And he arose , and departed to his house .
40:9:008:0	But when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
40:9:009:0	And as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him .
40:9:010:0	And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
40:9:011:0	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ?
40:9:012:0	But when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
40:9:013:0	But go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
40:9:014:0	Then came to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
40:9:015:0	And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
40:9:016:0	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
40:9:017:0	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved .
40:9:018:0	While he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
40:9:019:0	And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
40:9:020:0	And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
40:9:021:0	For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
40:9:022:0	But Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour .
40:9:023:0	And when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
40:9:024:0	He said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
40:9:025:0	But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
40:9:026:0	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
40:9:027:0	And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou Son of David , have mercy on us .
40:9:028:0	And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
40:9:029:0	Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
40:9:030:0	And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus straitly charged them , saying , See that no man know it .
40:9:031:0	But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
40:9:032:0	As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
40:9:033:0	And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
40:9:034:0	But the Pharisees said , He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils .
40:9:035:0	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
40:9:036:0	But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
40:9:037:0	Then saith he unto his disciples , The harvest truly is plenteous , but the labourers are few ;
40:9:038:0	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he will send forth labourers into his harvest .
