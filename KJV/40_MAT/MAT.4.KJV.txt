40:4:001:0	Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
40:4:002:0	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
40:4:003:0	And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
40:4:004:0	But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
40:4:005:0	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
40:4:006:0	And saith unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down : for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
40:4:007:0	Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
40:4:008:0	Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
40:4:009:0	And saith unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
40:4:010:0	Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
40:4:011:0	Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
40:4:012:0	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
40:4:013:0	And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
40:4:014:0	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
40:4:015:0	The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ;
40:4:016:0	The people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
40:4:017:0	From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40:4:018:0	And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
40:4:019:0	And he saith unto them , Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men .
40:4:020:0	And they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
40:4:021:0	And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
40:4:022:0	And they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
40:4:023:0	And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
40:4:024:0	And his fame went throughout all Syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with devils , and those which were lunatic , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them .
40:4:025:0	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee , and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem , and from Judaea , and from beyond Jordan .
