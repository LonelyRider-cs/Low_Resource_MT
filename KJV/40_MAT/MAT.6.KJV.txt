40:6:001:0	Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
40:6:002:0	Therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
40:6:003:0	But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
40:6:004:0	That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
40:6:005:0	And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
40:6:006:0	But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
40:6:007:0	But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
40:6:008:0	Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
40:6:009:0	After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
40:6:010:0	Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven .
40:6:011:0	Give us this day our daily bread .
40:6:012:0	And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
40:6:013:0	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen .
40:6:014:0	For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you :
40:6:015:0	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
40:6:016:0	Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
40:6:017:0	But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ;
40:6:018:0	That thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
40:6:019:0	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
40:6:020:0	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
40:6:021:0	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
40:6:022:0	The light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
40:6:023:0	But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
40:6:024:0	No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
40:6:025:0	Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
40:6:026:0	Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ?
40:6:027:0	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
40:6:028:0	And why take ye thought for raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
40:6:029:0	And yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
40:6:030:0	Wherefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
40:6:031:0	Therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , Wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
40:6:032:0	( For after all these things do the Gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
40:6:033:0	But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
40:6:034:0	Take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
