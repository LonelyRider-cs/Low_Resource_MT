40:20:001:0	For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
40:20:002:0	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40:20:003:0	And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
40:20:004:0	And said unto them ; Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way .
40:20:005:0	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
40:20:006:0	And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
40:20:007:0	They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
40:20:008:0	So when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
40:20:009:0	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
40:20:010:0	But when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
40:20:011:0	And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
40:20:012:0	Saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
40:20:013:0	But he answered one of them , and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penny ?
40:20:014:0	Take that thine is , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
40:20:015:0	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? Is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
40:20:016:0	So the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
40:20:017:0	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
40:20:018:0	Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
40:20:019:0	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
40:20:020:0	Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
40:20:021:0	And he said unto her , What wilt thou ? She saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
40:20:022:0	But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? They say unto him , We are able .
40:20:023:0	And he saith unto them , Ye shall drink indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father .
40:20:024:0	And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
40:20:025:0	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
40:20:026:0	But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
40:20:027:0	And whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant :
40:20:028:0	Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
40:20:029:0	And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
40:20:030:0	And , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
40:20:031:0	And the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
40:20:032:0	And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
40:20:033:0	They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
40:20:034:0	So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
