53:3:001:0	Finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may have free course , and be glorified , even as it is with you :
53:3:002:0	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men : for all men have not faith .
53:3:003:0	But the Lord is faithful , who shall stablish you , and keep you from evil .
53:3:004:0	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
53:3:005:0	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
53:3:006:0	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
53:3:007:0	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
53:3:008:0	Neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
53:3:009:0	Not because we have not power , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us .
53:3:010:0	For even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
53:3:011:0	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly , working not at all , but are busybodies .
53:3:012:0	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
53:3:013:0	But ye , brethren , be not weary in well doing .
53:3:014:0	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
53:3:015:0	Yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
53:3:016:0	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . The Lord be with you all .
53:3:017:0	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
53:3:018:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
