53:1:001:0	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timothy , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53:1:002:0	Grace unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53:1:003:0	We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
53:1:004:0	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure :
53:1:005:0	Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
53:1:006:0	Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ;
53:1:007:0	And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels ,
53:1:008:0	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
53:1:009:0	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
53:1:010:0	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
53:1:011:0	Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
53:1:012:0	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
