26:24:001:0	Again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:24:002:0	Son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
26:24:003:0	And utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord ; Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it :
26:24:004:0	Gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
26:24:005:0	Take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein .
26:24:006:0	Wherefore thus saith the Lord ; Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein , and whose scum is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall upon it .
26:24:007:0	For her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
26:24:008:0	That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance ; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
26:24:009:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Woe to the bloody city ! I will even make the pile for fire great .
26:24:010:0	Heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
26:24:011:0	Then set it empty upon the coals thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
26:24:012:0	She hath wearied herself with lies , and her great scum went not forth out of her : her scum shall be in the fire .
26:24:013:0	In thy filthiness is lewdness : because I have purged thee , and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more , till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee .
26:24:014:0	I the have spoken it : it shall come to pass , and I will do it ; I will not go back , neither will I spare , neither will I repent ; according to thy ways , and according to thy doings , shall they judge thee , saith the Lord .
26:24:015:0	Also the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:24:016:0	Son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall thy tears run down .
26:24:017:0	Forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on thy shoes upon thy feet , and cover not thy lips , and eat not the bread of men .
26:24:018:0	So I spake unto the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
26:24:019:0	And the people said unto me , Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us , that thou doest so ?
26:24:020:0	Then I answered them , The word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:24:021:0	Speak unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I will profane my sanctuary , the excellency of your strength , the desire of your eyes , and that which your soul pitieth ; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword .
26:24:022:0	And ye shall do as I have done : ye shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
26:24:023:0	And your tires shall be upon your heads , and your shoes upon your feet : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities , and mourn one toward another .
26:24:024:0	Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign : according to all that he hath done shall ye do : and when this cometh , ye shall know that I am the Lord .
26:24:025:0	Also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that whereupon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
26:24:026:0	That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
26:24:027:0	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the .
