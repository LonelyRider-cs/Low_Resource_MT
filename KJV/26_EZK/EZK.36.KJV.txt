26:36:001:0	Also , thou son of man , prophesy unto the mountains of Israel , and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the :
26:36:002:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Because the enemy hath said against you , Aha , even the ancient high places are ours in possession :
26:36:003:0	Therefore prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord ; Because they have made you desolate , and swallowed you up on every side , that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen , and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers , and are an infamy of the people :
26:36:004:0	Therefore , ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord ; Thus saith the Lord to the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys , to the desolate wastes , and to the cities that are forsaken , which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about ;
26:36:005:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen , and against all Edom , which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart , with despiteful minds , to cast it out for a prey .
26:36:006:0	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel , and say unto the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys , Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury , because ye have borne the shame of the heathen :
26:36:007:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; I have lifted up mine hand , Surely the heathen that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
26:36:008:0	But ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people of Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
26:36:009:0	For , behold , I am for you , and I will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown :
26:36:010:0	And I will multiply men upon you , all the house of Israel , even all of it : and the cities shall be inhabited , and the wastes shall be builded :
26:36:011:0	And I will multiply upon you man and beast ; and they shall increase and bring fruit : and I will settle you after your old estates , and will do better unto you than at your beginnings : and ye shall know that I am the .
26:36:012:0	Yea , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
26:36:013:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Because they say unto you , Thou land devourest up men , and hast bereaved thy nations ;
26:36:014:0	Therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nations any more , saith the Lord .
26:36:015:0	Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , saith the Lord .
26:36:016:0	Moreover the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:36:017:0	Son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
26:36:018:0	Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it :
26:36:019:0	And I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
26:36:020:0	And when they entered unto the heathen , whither they went , they profaned my holy name , when they said to them , These are the people of the , and are gone forth out of his land .
26:36:021:0	But I had pity for mine holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen , whither they went .
26:36:022:0	Therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord ; I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
26:36:023:0	And I will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the heathen , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the heathen shall know that I am the , saith the Lord , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
26:36:024:0	For I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
26:36:025:0	Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
26:36:026:0	A new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
26:36:027:0	And I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments , and do them .
26:36:028:0	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
26:36:029:0	I will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
26:36:030:0	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
26:36:031:0	Then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
26:36:032:0	Not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , O house of Israel .
26:36:033:0	Thus saith the Lord ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
26:36:034:0	And the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
26:36:035:0	And they shall say , This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced , and are inhabited .
26:36:036:0	Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the have spoken it , and I will do it .
26:36:037:0	Thus saith the Lord ; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them ; I will increase them with men like a flock .
26:36:038:0	As the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the .
