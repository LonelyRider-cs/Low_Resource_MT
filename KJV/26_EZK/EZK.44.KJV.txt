26:44:001:0	Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east ; and it was shut .
26:44:002:0	Then said the Lord unto me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the Lord , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
26:44:003:0	It is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
26:44:004:0	Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
26:44:005:0	And the Lord said unto me , Son of man , mark well , and behold with thine eyes , and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord , and all the laws thereof ; and mark well the entering in of the house , with every going forth of the sanctuary .
26:44:006:0	And thou shalt say to the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God ; O ye house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
26:44:007:0	In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers , uncircumcised in heart , and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to pollute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations .
26:44:008:0	And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
26:44:009:0	Thus saith the Lord God ; No stranger , uncircumcised in heart , nor uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any stranger that is among the children of Israel .
26:44:010:0	And the Levites that are gone away far from me , when Israel went astray , which went astray away from me after their idols ; they shall even bear their iniquity .
26:44:011:0	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house , and ministering to the house : they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
26:44:012:0	Because they ministered unto them before their idols , and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity ; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them , saith the Lord God , and they shall bear their iniquity .
26:44:013:0	And they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
26:44:014:0	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
26:44:015:0	But the priests the Levites , the sons of Zadok , that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me , they shall come near to me to minister unto me , and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood , saith the Lord God :
26:44:016:0	They shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
26:44:017:0	And it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them , whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
26:44:018:0	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat .
26:44:019:0	And when they go forth into the utter court , even into the utter court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered , and lay them in the holy chambers , and they shall put on other garments ; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments .
26:44:020:0	Neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only poll their heads .
26:44:021:0	Neither shall any priest drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
26:44:022:0	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
26:44:023:0	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
26:44:024:0	And in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
26:44:025:0	And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hath had no husband , they may defile themselves .
26:44:026:0	And after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
26:44:027:0	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , saith the Lord God .
26:44:028:0	And it shall be unto them for an inheritance : I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
26:44:029:0	They shall eat the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs .
26:44:030:0	And the first of all the firstfruits of all things , and every oblation of all , of every sort of your oblations , shall be the priest's : ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
26:44:031:0	The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself , or torn , whether it be fowl or beast .
