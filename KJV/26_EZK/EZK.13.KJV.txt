26:13:001:0	And the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:13:002:0	Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy , and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts , Hear ye the word of the ;
26:13:003:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Woe unto the foolish prophets , that follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
26:13:004:0	O Israel , thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts .
26:13:005:0	Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the .
26:13:006:0	They have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , The saith : and the hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
26:13:007:0	Have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , The saith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
26:13:008:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Because ye have spoken vanity , and seen lies , therefore , behold , I am against you , saith the Lord .
26:13:009:0	And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity , and that divine lies : they shall not be in the assembly of my people , neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel , neither shall they enter into the land of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
26:13:010:0	Because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there was no peace ; and one built up a wall , and , lo , others daubed it with untempered mortar :
26:13:011:0	Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
26:13:012:0	Lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
26:13:013:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger , and great hailstones in my fury to consume it .
26:13:014:0	So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that I am the .
26:13:015:0	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall , and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar , and will say unto you , The wall is no more , neither they that daubed it ;
26:13:016:0	To wit , the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem , and which see visions of peace for her , and there is no peace , saith the Lord .
26:13:017:0	Likewise , thou son of man , set thy face against the daughters of thy people , which prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy thou against them ,
26:13:018:0	And say , Thus saith the Lord ; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes , and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls ! Will ye hunt the souls of my people , and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you ?
26:13:019:0	And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to slay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that hear your lies ?
26:13:020:0	Wherefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I am against your pillows , wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly , and I will tear them from your arms , and will let the souls go , even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly .
26:13:021:0	Your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the .
26:13:022:0	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
26:13:023:0	Therefore ye shall see no more vanity , nor divine divinations : for I will deliver my people out of your hand : and ye shall know that I am the .
