26:30:001:0	The word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
26:30:002:0	Son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord God ; Howl ye , Woe worth the day !
26:30:003:0	For the day is near , even the day of the Lord is near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
26:30:004:0	And the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
26:30:005:0	Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
26:30:006:0	Thus saith the Lord ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord God .
26:30:007:0	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
26:30:008:0	And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
26:30:009:0	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
26:30:010:0	Thus saith the Lord God ; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon .
26:30:011:0	He and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
26:30:012:0	And I will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I the Lord have spoken it .
26:30:013:0	Thus saith the Lord God ; I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause their images to cease out of Memphis ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
26:30:014:0	And I will make Pathros desolate , and will set fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments in No .
26:30:015:0	And I will pour my fury upon Sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
26:30:016:0	And I will set fire in Egypt : Sin shall have great pain , and No shall be rent asunder , and Memphis shall have distresses daily .
26:30:017:0	The young men of Aven and of Piâ€“beseth shall fall by the sword : and these cities shall go into captivity .
26:30:018:0	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened , when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt : and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
26:30:019:0	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
26:30:020:0	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
26:30:021:0	Son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be healed , to put a roller to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
26:30:022:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
26:30:023:0	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
26:30:024:0	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break Pharaoh's arms , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
26:30:025:0	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down ; and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt .
26:30:026:0	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
