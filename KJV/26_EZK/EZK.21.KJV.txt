26:21:001:0	And the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:21:002:0	Son of man , set thy face toward Jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel ,
26:21:003:0	And say to the land of Israel , Thus saith the ; Behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
26:21:004:0	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
26:21:005:0	That all flesh may know that I the have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath : it shall not return any more .
26:21:006:0	Sigh therefore , thou son of man , with the breaking of thy loins ; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes .
26:21:007:0	And it shall be , when they say unto thee , Wherefore sighest thou ? that thou shalt answer , For the tidings ; because it cometh : and every heart shall melt , and all hands shall be feeble , and every spirit shall faint , and all knees shall be weak as water : behold , it cometh , and shall be brought to pass , saith the Lord .
26:21:008:0	Again the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:21:009:0	Son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith the ; Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished :
26:21:010:0	It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
26:21:011:0	And he hath given it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
26:21:012:0	Cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon thy thigh .
26:21:013:0	Because it is a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ? it shall be no more , saith the Lord .
26:21:014:0	Thou therefore , son of man , prophesy , and smite thine hands together , and let the sword be doubled the third time , the sword of the slain : it is the sword of the great men that are slain , which entereth into their privy chambers .
26:21:015:0	I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
26:21:016:0	Go thee one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , whithersoever thy face is set .
26:21:017:0	I will also smite mine hands together , and I will cause my fury to rest : I the have said it .
26:21:018:0	The word of the came unto me again , saying ,
26:21:019:0	Also , thou son of man , appoint thee two ways , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come : both twain shall come forth out of one land : and choose thou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
26:21:020:0	Appoint a way , that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites , and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced .
26:21:021:0	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way , at the head of the two ways , to use divination : he made his arrows bright , he consulted with images , he looked in the liver .
26:21:022:0	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem , to appoint captains , to open the mouth in the slaughter , to lift up the voice with shouting , to appoint battering rams against the gates , to cast a mount , and to build a fort .
26:21:023:0	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
26:21:024:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered , in that your transgressions are discovered , so that in all your doings your sins do appear ; because , I say , that ye are come to remembrance , ye shall be taken with the hand .
26:21:025:0	And thou , profane wicked prince of Israel , whose day is come , when iniquity shall have an end ,
26:21:026:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
26:21:027:0	I will overturn , overturn , overturn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him .
26:21:028:0	And thou , son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord concerning the Ammonites , and concerning their reproach ; even say thou , The sword , the sword is drawn : for the slaughter it is furbished , to consume because of the glittering :
26:21:029:0	Whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
26:21:030:0	Shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity .
26:21:031:0	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
26:21:032:0	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for I the have spoken it .
