26:35:001:0	Moreover the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:35:002:0	Son of man , set thy face against mount Seir , and prophesy against it ,
26:35:003:0	And say unto it , Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
26:35:004:0	I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the .
26:35:005:0	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred , and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time that their iniquity had an end :
26:35:006:0	Therefore , as I live , saith the Lord , I will prepare thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hated blood , even blood shall pursue thee .
26:35:007:0	Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate , and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth .
26:35:008:0	And I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
26:35:009:0	I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the .
26:35:010:0	Because thou hast said , These two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas the was there :
26:35:011:0	Therefore , as I live , saith the Lord , I will even do according to thine anger , and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them ; and I will make myself known among them , when I have judged thee .
26:35:012:0	And thou shalt know that I am the , and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
26:35:013:0	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard them .
26:35:014:0	Thus saith the Lord ; When the whole earth rejoiceth , I will make thee desolate .
26:35:015:0	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was desolate , so will I do unto thee : thou shalt be desolate , O mount Seir , and all Edom , even all of it : and they shall know that I am the .
