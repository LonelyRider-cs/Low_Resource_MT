26:3:001:0	Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , eat that thou findest ; eat this roll , and go speak unto the house of Israel .
26:3:002:0	So I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that roll .
26:3:003:0	And he said unto me , Son of man , cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee . Then did I eat it ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
26:3:004:0	And he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
26:3:005:0	For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
26:3:006:0	Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . Surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
26:3:007:0	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto me : for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted .
26:3:008:0	Behold , I have made thy face strong against their faces , and thy forehead strong against their foreheads .
26:3:009:0	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
26:3:010:0	Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
26:3:011:0	And go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Thus saith the Lord God ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
26:3:012:0	Then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place .
26:3:013:0	I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
26:3:014:0	So the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
26:3:015:0	Then I came to them of the captivity at Telâ€“abib , that dwelt by the river of Chebar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
26:3:016:0	And it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
26:3:017:0	Son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
26:3:018:0	When I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; and thou givest him not warning , nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way , to save his life ; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand .
26:3:019:0	Yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
26:3:020:0	Again , When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness , and commit iniquity , and I lay a stumblingblock before him , he shall die : because thou hast not given him warning , he shall die in his sin , and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered ; but his blood will I require at thine hand .
26:3:021:0	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man , that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall surely live , because he is warned ; also thou hast delivered thy soul .
26:3:022:0	And the hand of the Lord was there upon me ; and he said unto me , Arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee .
26:3:023:0	Then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
26:3:024:0	Then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and spake with me , and said unto me , Go , shut thyself within thine house .
26:3:025:0	But thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
26:3:026:0	And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
26:3:027:0	But when I speak with thee , I will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
