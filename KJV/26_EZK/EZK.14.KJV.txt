26:14:001:0	Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me , and sat before me .
26:14:002:0	And the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
26:14:003:0	Son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should I be enquired of at all by them ?
26:14:004:0	Therefore speak unto them , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to the prophet ; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols ;
26:14:005:0	That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
26:14:006:0	Therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God ; Repent , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
26:14:007:0	For every one of the house of Israel , or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel , which separateth himself from me , and setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me ; I the Lord will answer him by myself :
26:14:008:0	And I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
26:14:009:0	And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the Lord have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
26:14:010:0	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity : the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him ;
26:14:011:0	That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , saith the Lord God .
26:14:012:0	The word of the Lord came again to me , saying ,
26:14:013:0	Son of man , when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously , then will I stretch out mine hand upon it , and will break the staff of the bread thereof , and will send famine upon it , and will cut off man and beast from it :
26:14:014:0	Though these three men , Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness , saith the Lord God .
26:14:015:0	If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts :
26:14:016:0	Though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters ; they only shall be delivered , but the land shall be desolate .
26:14:017:0	Or if I bring a sword upon that land , and say , Sword , go through the land ; so that I cut off man and beast from it :
26:14:018:0	Though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only shall be delivered themselves .
26:14:019:0	Or if I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast :
26:14:020:0	Though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
26:14:021:0	For thus saith the Lord God ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
26:14:022:0	Yet , behold , therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth , both sons and daughters : behold , they shall come forth unto you , and ye shall see their way and their doings : and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , even concerning all that I have brought upon it .
26:14:023:0	And they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord God .
