26:15:001:0	And the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:15:002:0	Son of man , What is the vine tree more than any tree , or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
26:15:003:0	Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work ? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
26:15:004:0	Behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . Is it meet for any work ?
26:15:005:0	Behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hath devoured it , and it is burned ?
26:15:006:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
26:15:007:0	And I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour them ; and ye shall know that I am the , when I set my face against them .
26:15:008:0	And I will make the land desolate , because they have committed a trespass , saith the Lord .
