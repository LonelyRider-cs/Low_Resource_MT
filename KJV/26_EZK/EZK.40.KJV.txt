26:40:001:0	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me , and brought me thither .
26:40:002:0	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
26:40:003:0	And he brought me thither , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
26:40:004:0	And the man said unto me , Son of man , behold with thine eyes , and hear with thine ears , and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee ; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither : declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel .
26:40:005:0	And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about , and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth : so he measured the breadth of the building , one reed ; and the height , one reed .
26:40:006:0	Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad .
26:40:007:0	And every little chamber was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
26:40:008:0	He measured also the porch of the gate within , one reed .
26:40:009:0	Then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
26:40:010:0	And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
26:40:011:0	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits .
26:40:012:0	The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side , and the space was one cubit on that side : and the little chambers were six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
26:40:013:0	He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
26:40:014:0	He made also posts of threescore cubits , even unto the post of the court round about the gate .
26:40:015:0	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
26:40:016:0	And there were narrow windows to the little chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the arches : and windows were round about inward : and upon each post were palm trees .
26:40:017:0	Then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
26:40:018:0	And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement .
26:40:019:0	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
26:40:020:0	And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north , he measured the length thereof , and the breadth thereof .
26:40:021:0	And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate : the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
26:40:022:0	And their windows , and their arches , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof were before them .
26:40:023:0	And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits .
26:40:024:0	After that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
26:40:025:0	And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
26:40:026:0	And there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
26:40:027:0	And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits .
26:40:028:0	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
26:40:029:0	And the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
26:40:030:0	And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long , and five cubits broad .
26:40:031:0	And the arches thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof : and the going up to it had eight steps .
26:40:032:0	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures .
26:40:033:0	And the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , were according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
26:40:034:0	And the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
26:40:035:0	And he brought me to the north gate , and measured it according to these measures ;
26:40:036:0	The little chambers thereof , the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , and the windows to it round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
26:40:037:0	And the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
26:40:038:0	And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates , where they washed the burnt offering .
26:40:039:0	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
26:40:040:0	And at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
26:40:041:0	Four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew their sacrifices .
26:40:042:0	And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering , of a cubit and an half long , and a cubit and an half broad , and one cubit high : whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice .
26:40:043:0	And within were hooks , an hand broad , fastened round about : and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering .
26:40:044:0	And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
26:40:045:0	And he said unto me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
26:40:046:0	And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , which come near to the Lord to minister unto him .
26:40:047:0	So he measured the court , an hundred cubits long , and an hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar that was before the house .
26:40:048:0	And he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
26:40:049:0	The length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits ; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
