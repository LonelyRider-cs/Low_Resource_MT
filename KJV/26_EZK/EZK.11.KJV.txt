26:11:001:0	Moreover the spirit lifted me up , and brought me unto the east gate of the Lord's house , which looketh eastward : and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men ; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur , and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah , princes of the people .
26:11:002:0	Then said he unto me , Son of man , these are the men that devise mischief , and give wicked counsel in this city :
26:11:003:0	Which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
26:11:004:0	Therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , O son of man .
26:11:005:0	And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the Lord ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
26:11:006:0	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
26:11:007:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
26:11:008:0	Ye have feared the sword ; and I will bring a sword upon you , saith the Lord God .
26:11:009:0	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
26:11:010:0	Ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
26:11:011:0	This city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
26:11:012:0	And ye shall know that I am the Lord : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you .
26:11:013:0	And it came to pass , when I prophesied , that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died . Then fell I down upon my face , and cried with a loud voice , and said , Ah Lord God ! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel ?
26:11:014:0	Again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
26:11:015:0	Son of man , thy brethren , even thy brethren , the men of thy kindred , and all the house of Israel wholly , are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said , Get you far from the Lord : unto us is this land given in possession .
26:11:016:0	Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord God ; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen , and although I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come .
26:11:017:0	Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord God ; I will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
26:11:018:0	And they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
26:11:019:0	And I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
26:11:020:0	That they may walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
26:11:021:0	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord God .
26:11:022:0	Then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
26:11:023:0	And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
26:11:024:0	Afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . So the vision that I had seen went up from me .
26:11:025:0	Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the Lord had shewed me .
