26:12:001:0	The word of the also came unto me , saying ,
26:12:002:0	Son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have ears to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebellious house .
26:12:003:0	Therefore , thou son of man , prepare thee stuff for removing , and remove by day in their sight ; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight : it may be they will consider , though they be a rebellious house .
26:12:004:0	Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
26:12:005:0	Dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
26:12:006:0	In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders , and carry it forth in the twilight : thou shalt cover thy face , that thou see not the ground : for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel .
26:12:007:0	And I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for captivity , and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the twilight , and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight .
26:12:008:0	And in the morning came the word of the unto me , saying ,
26:12:009:0	Son of man , hath not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , What doest thou ?
26:12:010:0	Say thou unto them , Thus saith the Lord ; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem , and all the house of Israel that are among them .
26:12:011:0	Say , I am your sign : like as I have done , so shall it be done unto them : they shall remove and go into captivity .
26:12:012:0	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , that he see not the ground with his eyes .
26:12:013:0	My net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
26:12:014:0	And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
26:12:015:0	And they shall know that I am the , when I shall scatter them among the nations , and disperse them in the countries .
26:12:016:0	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come ; and they shall know that I am the .
26:12:017:0	Moreover the word of the came to me , saying ,
26:12:018:0	Son of man , eat thy bread with quaking , and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness ;
26:12:019:0	And say unto the people of the land , Thus saith the Lord of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and of the land of Israel ; They shall eat their bread with carefulness , and drink their water with astonishment , that her land may be desolate from all that is therein , because of the violence of all them that dwell therein .
26:12:020:0	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be desolate ; and ye shall know that I am the .
26:12:021:0	And the word of the came unto me , saying ,
26:12:022:0	Son of man , what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel , saying , The days are prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
26:12:023:0	Tell them therefore , Thus saith the Lord ; I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
26:12:024:0	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel .
26:12:025:0	For I am the : I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in your days , O rebellious house , will I say the word , and will perform it , saith the Lord .
26:12:026:0	Again the word of the came to me , saying ,
26:12:027:0	Son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off .
26:12:028:0	Therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord .
