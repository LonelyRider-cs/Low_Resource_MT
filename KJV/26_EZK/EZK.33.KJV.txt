26:33:001:0	Again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
26:33:002:0	Son of man , speak to the children of thy people , and say unto them , When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their coasts , and set him for their watchman :
26:33:003:0	If when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
26:33:004:0	Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning ; if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
26:33:005:0	He heard the sound of the trumpet , and took not warning ; his blood shall be upon him . But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul .
26:33:006:0	But if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned ; if the sword come , and take any person from among them , he is taken away in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand .
26:33:007:0	So thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
26:33:008:0	When I say unto the wicked , O wicked man , thou shalt surely die ; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand .
26:33:009:0	Nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
26:33:010:0	Therefore , O thou son of man , speak unto the house of Israel ; Thus ye speak , saying , If our transgressions and our sins be upon us , and we pine away in them , how should we then live ?
26:33:011:0	Say unto them , As I live , saith the Lord God , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from his way and live : turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways ; for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
26:33:012:0	Therefore , thou son of man , say unto the children of thy people , The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression : as for the wickedness of the wicked , he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness ; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth .
26:33:013:0	When I shall say to the righteous , that he shall surely live ; if he trust to his own righteousness , and commit iniquity , all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered ; but for his iniquity that he hath committed , he shall die for it .
26:33:014:0	Again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
26:33:015:0	If the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he had robbed , walk in the statutes of life , without committing iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
26:33:016:0	None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
26:33:017:0	Yet the children of thy people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
26:33:018:0	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , he shall even die thereby .
26:33:019:0	But if the wicked turn from his wickedness , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
26:33:020:0	Yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
26:33:021:0	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten .
26:33:022:0	Now the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening , afore he that was escaped came ; and had opened my mouth , until he came to me in the morning ; and my mouth was opened , and I was no more dumb .
26:33:023:0	Then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
26:33:024:0	Son of man , they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak , saying , Abraham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many ; the land is given us for inheritance .
26:33:025:0	Wherefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Ye eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
26:33:026:0	Ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
26:33:027:0	Say thou thus unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; As I live , surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword , and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured , and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence .
26:33:028:0	For I will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
26:33:029:0	Then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed .
26:33:030:0	Also , thou son of man , the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another , every one to his brother , saying , Come , I pray you , and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord .
26:33:031:0	And they come unto thee as the people cometh , and they sit before thee as my people , and they hear thy words , but they will not do them : for with their mouth they shew much love , but their heart goeth after their covetousness .
26:33:032:0	And , lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear thy words , but they do them not .
26:33:033:0	And when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
