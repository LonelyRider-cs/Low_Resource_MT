15:5:001:0	Then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
15:5:002:0	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
15:5:003:0	At the same time came to them Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar–bozenai , and their companions , and said thus unto them , Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
15:5:004:0	Then said we unto them after this manner , What are the names of the men that make this building ?
15:5:005:0	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
15:5:006:0	The copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar–bozenai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
15:5:007:0	They sent a letter unto him , wherein was written thus ; Unto Darius the king , all peace .
15:5:008:0	Be it known unto the king , that we went into the province of Judah , to the house of the great God , which is builded with great stones , and timber is laid in the walls , and this work goeth fast on , and prospereth in their hands .
15:5:009:0	Then asked we those elders , and said unto them thus , Who commanded you to build this house , and to make up these walls ?
15:5:010:0	We asked their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
15:5:011:0	And thus they returned us answer , saying , We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth , and build the house that was builded these many years ago , which a great king of Israel builded and set up .
15:5:012:0	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
15:5:013:0	But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
15:5:014:0	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered unto one , whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
15:5:015:0	And said unto him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be builded in his place .
15:5:016:0	Then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
15:5:017:0	Now therefore , if it seem good to the king , let there be search made in the king 's treasure house , which is there at Babylon , whether it be so , that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem , and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter .
