15:10:001:0	Now when Ezra had prayed , and when he had confessed , weeping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people wept very sore .
15:10:002:0	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
15:10:003:0	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives , and such as are born of them , according to the counsel of my lord , and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God ; and let it be done according to the law .
15:10:004:0	Arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
15:10:005:0	Then arose Ezra , and made the chief priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . And they sware .
15:10:006:0	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God , and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib : and when he came thither , he did eat no bread , nor drink water : for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away .
15:10:007:0	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
15:10:008:0	And that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away .
15:10:009:0	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God , trembling because of this matter , and for the great rain .
15:10:010:0	And Ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , Ye have transgressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the trespass of Israel .
15:10:011:0	Now therefore make confession unto the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
15:10:012:0	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice , As thou hast said , so must we do .
15:10:013:0	But the people are many , and it is a time of much rain , and we are not able to stand without , neither is this a work of one day or two : for we are many that have transgressed in this thing .
15:10:014:0	Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand , and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times , and with them the elders of every city , and the judges thereof , until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us .
15:10:015:0	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter : and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them .
15:10:016:0	And the children of the captivity did so . And Ezra the priest , with certain chief of the fathers , after the house of their fathers , and all of them by their names , were separated , and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
15:10:017:0	And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
15:10:018:0	And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
15:10:019:0	And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass .
