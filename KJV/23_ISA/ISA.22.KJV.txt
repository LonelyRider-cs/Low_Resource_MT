23:22:001:0	The burden of the valley of vision . What aileth thee now , that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops ?
23:22:002:0	Thou that art full of stirs , a tumultuous city , a joyous city : thy slain men are not slain with the sword , nor dead in battle .
23:22:003:0	All thy rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
23:22:004:0	Therefore said I , Look away from me ; I will weep bitterly , labour not to comfort me , because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people .
23:22:005:0	For it is a day of trouble , and of treading down , and of perplexity by the Lord God of hosts in the valley of vision , breaking down the walls , and of crying to the mountains .
23:22:006:0	And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen , and Kir uncovered the shield .
23:22:007:0	And it shall come to pass , that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
23:22:008:0	And he discovered the covering of Judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest .
23:22:009:0	Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
23:22:010:0	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
23:22:011:0	Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof , neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago .
23:22:012:0	And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth :
23:22:013:0	And behold joy and gladness , slaying oxen , and killing sheep , eating flesh , and drinking wine : let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we shall die .
23:22:014:0	And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts , Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , saith the Lord God of hosts .
23:22:015:0	Thus saith the Lord God of hosts , Go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto Shebna , which is over the house , and say ,
23:22:016:0	What hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock ?
23:22:017:0	Behold , the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity , and will surely cover thee .
23:22:018:0	He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house .
23:22:019:0	And I will drive thee from thy station , and from thy state shall he pull thee down .
23:22:020:0	And it shall come to pass in that day , that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah :
23:22:021:0	And I will clothe him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy girdle , and I will commit thy government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
23:22:022:0	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
23:22:023:0	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house .
23:22:024:0	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups , even to all the vessels of flagons .
23:22:025:0	In that day , saith the Lord of hosts , shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the Lord hath spoken it .
