23:35:001:0	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
23:35:002:0	It shall blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing : the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it , the excellency of Carmel and Sharon , they shall see the glory of the , and the excellency of our God .
23:35:003:0	Strengthen ye the weak hands , and confirm the feeble knees .
23:35:004:0	Say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
23:35:005:0	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
23:35:006:0	Then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
23:35:007:0	And the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with reeds and rushes .
23:35:008:0	And an highway shall be there , and a way , and it shall be called The way of holiness ; the unclean shall not pass over it ; but it shall be for those : the wayfaring men , though fools , shall not err therein .
23:35:009:0	No lion shall be there , nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon , it shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
23:35:010:0	And the ransomed of the shall return , and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads : they shall obtain joy and gladness , and sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
