23:8:001:0	Moreover the Lord said unto me , Take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher–shalal–hash–baz .
23:8:002:0	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record , Uriah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah .
23:8:003:0	And I went unto the prophetess ; and she conceived , and bare a son . Then said the Lord to me , Call his name Maher–shalal–hash–baz .
23:8:004:0	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria .
23:8:005:0	The Lord spake also unto me again , saying ,
23:8:006:0	Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son ;
23:8:007:0	Now therefore , behold , the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river , strong and many , even the king of Assyria , and all his glory : and he shall come up over all his channels , and go over all his banks :
23:8:008:0	And he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel .
23:8:009:0	Associate yourselves , O ye people , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; and give ear , all ye of far countries : gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces .
23:8:010:0	Take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
23:8:011:0	For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
23:8:012:0	Say ye not , A confederacy , to all them to whom this people shall say , A confederacy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be afraid .
23:8:013:0	Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
23:8:014:0	And he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
23:8:015:0	And many among them shall stumble , and fall , and be broken , and be snared , and be taken .
23:8:016:0	Bind up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples .
23:8:017:0	And I will wait upon the Lord , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
23:8:018:0	Behold , I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
23:8:019:0	And when they shall say unto you , Seek unto them that have familiar spirits , and unto wizards that peep , and that mutter : should not a people seek unto their God ? for the living to the dead ?
23:8:020:0	To the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
23:8:021:0	And they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward .
23:8:022:0	And they shall look unto the earth ; and behold trouble and darkness , dimness of anguish ; and they shall be driven to darkness .
