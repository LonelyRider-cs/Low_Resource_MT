23:2:001:0	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem .
23:2:002:0	And it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it .
23:2:003:0	And many people shall go and say , Come ye , and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths : for out of Zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
23:2:004:0	And he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
23:2:005:0	O house of Jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of the Lord .
23:2:006:0	Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob , because they be replenished from the east , and are soothsayers like the Philistines , and they please themselves in the children of strangers .
23:2:007:0	Their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
23:2:008:0	Their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
23:2:009:0	And the mean man boweth down , and the great man humbleth himself : therefore forgive them not .
23:2:010:0	Enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty .
23:2:011:0	The lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
23:2:012:0	For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
23:2:013:0	And upon all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ,
23:2:014:0	And upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ,
23:2:015:0	And upon every high tower , and upon every fenced wall ,
23:2:016:0	And upon all the ships of Tarshish , and upon all pleasant pictures .
23:2:017:0	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
23:2:018:0	And the idols he shall utterly abolish .
23:2:019:0	And they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
23:2:020:0	In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
23:2:021:0	To go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rocks , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
23:2:022:0	Cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils : for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
