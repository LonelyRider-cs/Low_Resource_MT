23:54:001:0	Sing , O barren , thou that didst not bear ; break forth into singing , and cry aloud , thou that didst not travail with child : for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife , saith the Lord .
23:54:002:0	Enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations : spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes ;
23:54:003:0	For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
23:54:004:0	Fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
23:54:005:0	For thy Maker is thine husband ; the Lord of hosts is his name ; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel ; The God of the whole earth shall he be called .
23:54:006:0	For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit , and a wife of youth , when thou wast refused , saith thy God .
23:54:007:0	For a small moment have I forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will I gather thee .
23:54:008:0	In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee , saith the Lord thy Redeemer .
23:54:009:0	For this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
23:54:010:0	For the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed , saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee .
23:54:011:0	O thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , I will lay thy stones with fair colours , and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
23:54:012:0	And I will make thy windows of agates , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy borders of pleasant stones .
23:54:013:0	And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
23:54:014:0	In righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
23:54:015:0	Behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by me : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake .
23:54:016:0	Behold , I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire , and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
23:54:017:0	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn . This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord , and their righteousness is of me , saith the Lord .
