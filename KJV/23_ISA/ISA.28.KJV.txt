23:28:001:0	Woe to the crown of pride , to the drunkards of Ephraim , whose glorious beauty is a fading flower , which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine !
23:28:002:0	Behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
23:28:003:0	The crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , shall be trodden under feet :
23:28:004:0	And the glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fat valley , shall be a fading flower , and as the hasty fruit before the summer ; which when he that looketh upon it seeth , while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up .
23:28:005:0	In that day shall the of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people ,
23:28:006:0	And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
23:28:007:0	But they also have erred through wine , and through strong drink are out of the way ; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink , they are swallowed up of wine , they are out of the way through strong drink ; they err in vision , they stumble in judgment .
23:28:008:0	For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness , so that there is no place clean .
23:28:009:0	Whom shall he teach knowledge ? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine ? them that are weaned from the milk , and drawn from the breasts .
23:28:010:0	For precept must be upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little :
23:28:011:0	For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people .
23:28:012:0	To whom he said , This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest ; and this is the refreshing : yet they would not hear .
23:28:013:0	But the word of the was unto them precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little ; that they might go , and fall backward , and be broken , and snared , and taken .
23:28:014:0	Wherefore hear the word of the , ye scornful men , that rule this people which is in Jerusalem .
23:28:015:0	Because ye have said , We have made a covenant with death , and with hell are we at agreement ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , it shall not come unto us : for we have made lies our refuge , and under falsehood have we hid ourselves :
23:28:016:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord , Behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believeth shall not make haste .
23:28:017:0	Judgment also will I lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet : and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters shall overflow the hiding place .
23:28:018:0	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
23:28:019:0	From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
23:28:020:0	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
23:28:021:0	For the shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
23:28:022:0	Now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
23:28:023:0	Give ye ear , and hear my voice ; hearken , and hear my speech .
23:28:024:0	Doth the plowman plow all day to sow ? doth he open and break the clods of his ground ?
23:28:025:0	When he hath made plain the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the fitches , and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place ?
23:28:026:0	For his God doth instruct him to discretion , and doth teach him .
23:28:027:0	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
23:28:028:0	Bread corn is bruised ; because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
23:28:029:0	This also cometh forth from the of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
