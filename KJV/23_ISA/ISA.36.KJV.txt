23:36:001:0	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah , and took them .
23:36:002:0	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army . And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
23:36:003:0	Then came forth unto him Eliakim , Hilkiah 's son , which was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , Asaph 's son , the recorder .
23:36:004:0	And Rabshakeh said unto them , Say ye now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
23:36:005:0	I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
23:36:006:0	Lo , thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed , on Egypt ; whereon if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and pierce it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him .
23:36:007:0	But if thou say to me , We trust in the our God : is it not he , whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and said to Judah and to Jerusalem , Ye shall worship before this altar ?
23:36:008:0	Now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
23:36:009:0	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
23:36:010:0	And am I now come up without the against this land to destroy it ? the said unto me , Go up against this land , and destroy it .
23:36:011:0	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh , Speak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
23:36:012:0	But Rabshakeh said , Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own piss with you ?
23:36:013:0	Then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
23:36:014:0	Thus saith the king , Let not Hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you .
23:36:015:0	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the , saying , The will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
23:36:016:0	Hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern ;
23:36:017:0	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
23:36:018:0	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , The will deliver us . Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
23:36:019:0	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
23:36:020:0	Who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
23:36:021:0	But they held their peace , and answered him not a word : for the king 's commandment was , saying , Answer him not .
23:36:022:0	Then came Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , that was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
