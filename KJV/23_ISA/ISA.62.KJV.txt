23:62:001:0	For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
23:62:002:0	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the Lord shall name .
23:62:003:0	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God .
23:62:004:0	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken ; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate : but thou shalt be called Hephziâ€“bah , and thy land Beulah : for the Lord delighteth in thee , and thy land shall be married .
23:62:005:0	For as a young man marrieth a virgin , so shall thy sons marry thee : and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so shall thy God rejoice over thee .
23:62:006:0	I have set watchmen upon thy walls , O Jerusalem , which shall never hold their peace day nor night : ye that make mention of the Lord , keep not silence ,
23:62:007:0	And give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth .
23:62:008:0	The Lord hath sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies ; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine , for the which thou hast laboured :
23:62:009:0	But they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the Lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
23:62:010:0	Go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
23:62:011:0	Behold , the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world , Say ye to the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
23:62:012:0	And they shall call them , The holy people , The redeemed of the Lord : and thou shalt be called , Sought out , A city not forsaken .
