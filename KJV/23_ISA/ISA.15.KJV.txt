23:15:001:0	The burden of Moab . Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
23:15:002:0	He is gone up to Bajith , and to Dibon , the high places , to weep : Moab shall howl over Nebo , and over Medeba : on all their heads shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
23:15:003:0	In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth : on the tops of their houses , and in their streets , every one shall howl , weeping abundantly .
23:15:004:0	And Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
23:15:005:0	My heart shall cry out for Moab ; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar , an heifer of three years old : for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up ; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
23:15:006:0	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate : for the hay is withered away , the grass faileth , there is no green thing .
23:15:007:0	Therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the brook of the willows .
23:15:008:0	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab ; the howling thereof unto Eglaim , and the howling thereof unto Beerâ€“elim .
23:15:009:0	For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood : for I will bring more upon Dimon , lions upon him that escapeth of Moab , and upon the remnant of the land .
