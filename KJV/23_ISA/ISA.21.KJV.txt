23:21:001:0	The burden of the desert of the sea . As whirlwinds in the south pass through ; so it cometh from the desert , from a terrible land .
23:21:002:0	A grievous vision is declared unto me ; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously , and the spoiler spoileth . Go up , O Elam : besiege , O Media ; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease .
23:21:003:0	Therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
23:21:004:0	My heart panted , fearfulness affrighted me : the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me .
23:21:005:0	Prepare the table , watch in the watchtower , eat , drink : arise , ye princes , and anoint the shield .
23:21:006:0	For thus hath the Lord said unto me , Go , set a watchman , let him declare what he seeth .
23:21:007:0	And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen , a chariot of asses , and a chariot of camels ; and he hearkened diligently with much heed :
23:21:008:0	And he cried , A lion : My lord , I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime , and I am set in my ward whole nights :
23:21:009:0	And , behold , here cometh a chariot of men , with a couple of horsemen . And he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
23:21:010:0	O my threshing , and the corn of my floor : that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared unto you .
23:21:011:0	The burden of Dumah . He calleth to me out of Seir , Watchman , what of the night ? Watchman , what of the night ?
23:21:012:0	The watchman said , The morning cometh , and also the night : if ye will enquire , enquire ye : return , come .
23:21:013:0	The burden upon Arabia . In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge , O ye travelling companies of Dedanim .
23:21:014:0	The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty , they prevented with their bread him that fled .
23:21:015:0	For they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
23:21:016:0	For thus hath the Lord said unto me , Within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail :
23:21:017:0	And the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , shall be diminished : for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it .
