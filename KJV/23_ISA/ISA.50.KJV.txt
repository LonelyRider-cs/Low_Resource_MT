23:50:001:0	Thus saith the , Where is the bill of your mother 's divorcement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? Behold , for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves , and for your transgressions is your mother put away .
23:50:002:0	Wherefore , when I came , was there no man ? when I called , was there none to answer ? Is my hand shortened at all , that it can not redeem ? or have I no power to deliver ? behold , at my rebuke I dry up the sea , I make the rivers a wilderness : their fish stinketh , because there is no water , and dieth for thirst .
23:50:003:0	I clothe the heavens with blackness , and I make sackcloth their covering .
23:50:004:0	The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
23:50:005:0	The Lord hath opened mine ear , and I was not rebellious , neither turned away back .
23:50:006:0	I gave my back to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair : I hid not my face from shame and spitting .
23:50:007:0	For the Lord will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
23:50:008:0	He is near that justifieth me ; who will contend with me ? let us stand together : who is mine adversary ? let him come near to me .
23:50:009:0	Behold , the Lord will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
23:50:010:0	Who is among you that feareth the , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the , and stay upon his God .
23:50:011:0	Behold , all ye that kindle a fire , that compass yourselves about with sparks : walk in the light of your fire , and in the sparks that ye have kindled . This shall ye have of mine hand ; ye shall lie down in sorrow .
