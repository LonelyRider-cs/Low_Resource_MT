23:32:001:0	Behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
23:32:002:0	And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
23:32:003:0	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
23:32:004:0	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
23:32:005:0	The vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
23:32:006:0	For the vile person will speak villany , and his heart will work iniquity , to practise hypocrisy , and to utter error against the , to make empty the soul of the hungry , and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
23:32:007:0	The instruments also of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
23:32:008:0	But the liberal deviseth liberal things ; and by liberal things shall he stand .
23:32:009:0	Rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
23:32:010:0	Many days and years shall ye be troubled , ye careless women : for the vintage shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
23:32:011:0	Tremble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye careless ones : strip you , and make you bare , and gird sackcloth upon your loins .
23:32:012:0	They shall lament for the teats , for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
23:32:013:0	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers ; yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city :
23:32:014:0	Because the palaces shall be forsaken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ;
23:32:015:0	Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
23:32:016:0	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness , and righteousness remain in the fruitful field .
23:32:017:0	And the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever .
23:32:018:0	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwellings , and in quiet resting places ;
23:32:019:0	When it shall hail , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
23:32:020:0	Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass .
