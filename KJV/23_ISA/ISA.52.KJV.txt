23:52:001:0	Awake , awake ; put on thy strength , O Zion ; put on thy beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean .
23:52:002:0	Shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of thy neck , O captive daughter of Zion .
23:52:003:0	For thus saith the , Ye have sold yourselves for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money .
23:52:004:0	For thus saith the Lord , My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there ; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause .
23:52:005:0	Now therefore , what have I here , saith the , that my people is taken away for nought ? they that rule over them make them to howl , saith the ; and my name continually every day is blasphemed .
23:52:006:0	Therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak : behold , it is I .
23:52:007:0	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ; that bringeth good tidings of good , that publisheth salvation ; that saith unto Zion , Thy God reigneth !
23:52:008:0	Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the shall bring again Zion .
23:52:009:0	Break forth into joy , sing together , ye waste places of Jerusalem : for the hath comforted his people , he hath redeemed Jerusalem .
23:52:010:0	The hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
23:52:011:0	Depart ye , depart ye , go ye out from thence , touch no unclean thing ; go ye out of the midst of her ; be ye clean , that bear the vessels of the .
23:52:012:0	For ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rearward .
23:52:013:0	Behold , my servant shall deal prudently , he shall be exalted and extolled , and be very high .
23:52:014:0	As many were astonished at thee ; his visage was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men :
23:52:015:0	So shall he sprinkle many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
