23:24:001:0	Behold , the maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
23:24:002:0	And it shall be , as with the people , so with the priest ; as with the servant , so with his master ; as with the maid , so with her mistress ; as with the buyer , so with the seller ; as with the lender , so with the borrower ; as with the taker of usury , so with the giver of usury to him .
23:24:003:0	The land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled : for the hath spoken this word .
23:24:004:0	The earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
23:24:005:0	The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , changed the ordinance , broken the everlasting covenant .
23:24:006:0	Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
23:24:007:0	The new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merryhearted do sigh .
23:24:008:0	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
23:24:009:0	They shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
23:24:010:0	The city of confusion is broken down : every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
23:24:011:0	There is a crying for wine in the streets ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
23:24:012:0	In the city is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
23:24:013:0	When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
23:24:014:0	They shall lift up their voice , they shall sing for the majesty of the , they shall cry aloud from the sea .
23:24:015:0	Wherefore glorify ye the in the fires , even the name of the God of Israel in the isles of the sea .
23:24:016:0	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs , even glory to the righteous . But I said , My leanness , my leanness , woe unto me ! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously ; yea , the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously .
23:24:017:0	Fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , O inhabitant of the earth .
23:24:018:0	And it shall come to pass , that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth do shake .
23:24:019:0	The earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly .
23:24:020:0	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
23:24:021:0	And it shall come to pass in that day , that the shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
23:24:022:0	And they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
23:24:023:0	Then the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed , when the of hosts shall reign in mount Zion , and in Jerusalem , and before his ancients gloriously .
