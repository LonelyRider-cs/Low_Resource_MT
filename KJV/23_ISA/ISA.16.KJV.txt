23:16:001:0	Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of Zion .
23:16:002:0	For it shall be , that , as a wandering bird cast out of the nest , so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon .
23:16:003:0	Take counsel , execute judgment ; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts ; bewray not him that wandereth .
23:16:004:0	Let mine outcasts dwell with thee , Moab ; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler : for the extortioner is at an end , the spoiler ceaseth , the oppressors are consumed out of the land .
23:16:005:0	And in mercy shall the throne be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David , judging , and seeking judgment , and hasting righteousness .
23:16:006:0	We have heard of the pride of Moab ; he is very proud : even of his haughtiness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
23:16:007:0	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab , every one shall howl : for the foundations of Kir–hareseth shall ye mourn ; surely they are stricken .
23:16:008:0	For the fields of Heshbon languish , and the vine of Sibmah : the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof , they are come even unto Jazer , they wandered through the wilderness : her branches are stretched out , they are gone over the sea .
23:16:009:0	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah : I will water thee with my tears , O Heshbon , and Elealeh : for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen .
23:16:010:0	And gladness is taken away , and joy out of the plentiful field ; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing , neither shall there be shouting : the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses ; I have made their vintage shouting to cease .
23:16:011:0	Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab , and mine inward parts for Kir–heres .
23:16:012:0	And it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
23:16:013:0	This is the word that the hath spoken concerning Moab since that time .
23:16:014:0	But now the hath spoken , saying , Within three years , as the years of an hireling , and the glory of Moab shall be contemned , with all that great multitude ; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble .
