23:13:001:0	The burden of Babylon , which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see .
23:13:002:0	Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain , exalt the voice unto them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
23:13:003:0	I have commanded my sanctified ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my highness .
23:13:004:0	The noise of a multitude in the mountains , like as of a great people ; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together : the of hosts mustereth the host of the battle .
23:13:005:0	They come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
23:13:006:0	Howl ye ; for the day of the is at hand ; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty .
23:13:007:0	Therefore shall all hands be faint , and every man 's heart shall melt :
23:13:008:0	And they shall be afraid : pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them ; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth : they shall be amazed one at another ; their faces shall be as flames .
23:13:009:0	Behold , the day of the cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
23:13:010:0	For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light : the sun shall be darkened in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to shine .
23:13:011:0	And I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity ; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease , and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible .
23:13:012:0	I will make a man more precious than fine gold ; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir .
23:13:013:0	Therefore I will shake the heavens , and the earth shall remove out of her place , in the wrath of the of hosts , and in the day of his fierce anger .
23:13:014:0	And it shall be as the chased roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
23:13:015:0	Every one that is found shall be thrust through ; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword .
23:13:016:0	Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
23:13:017:0	Behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
23:13:018:0	Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; their eye shall not spare children .
23:13:019:0	And Babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the Chaldeans ' excellency , shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah .
23:13:020:0	It shall never be inhabited , neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation : neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there .
23:13:021:0	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there .
23:13:022:0	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
