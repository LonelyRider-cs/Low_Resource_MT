23:37:001:0	And it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the .
23:37:002:0	And he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
23:37:003:0	And they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
23:37:004:0	It may be the thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God , and will reprove the words which the thy God hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left .
23:37:005:0	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
23:37:006:0	And Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say unto your master , Thus saith the , Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
23:37:007:0	Behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
23:37:008:0	So Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
23:37:009:0	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , He is come forth to make war with thee . And when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
23:37:010:0	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
23:37:011:0	Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly ; and shalt thou be delivered ?
23:37:012:0	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ?
23:37:013:0	Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ?
23:37:014:0	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the , and spread it before the .
23:37:015:0	And Hezekiah prayed unto the , saying ,
23:37:016:0	O of hosts , God of Israel , that dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
23:37:017:0	Incline thine ear , O , and hear ; open thine eyes , O , and see : and hear all the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living God .
23:37:018:0	Of a truth , , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations , and their countries ,
23:37:019:0	And have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
23:37:020:0	Now therefore , O our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the , even thou only .
23:37:021:0	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the God of Israel , Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria :
23:37:022:0	This is the word which the hath spoken concerning him ; The virgin , the daughter of Zion , hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
23:37:023:0	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
23:37:024:0	By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord , and hast said , By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains , to the sides of Lebanon ; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof , and the choice fir trees thereof : and I will enter into the height of his border , and the forest of his Carmel .
23:37:025:0	I have digged , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places .
23:37:026:0	Hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps .
23:37:027:0	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
23:37:028:0	But I know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .
23:37:029:0	Because thy rage against me , and thy tumult , is come up into mine ears , therefore will I put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
23:37:030:0	And this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself ; and the second year that which springeth of the same : and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof .
23:37:031:0	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
23:37:032:0	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the of hosts shall do this .
23:37:033:0	Therefore thus saith the concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shields , nor cast a bank against it .
23:37:034:0	By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the .
23:37:035:0	For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
23:37:036:0	Then the angel of the went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
23:37:037:0	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at Nineveh .
23:37:038:0	And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and Esarâ€“haddon his son reigned in his stead .
