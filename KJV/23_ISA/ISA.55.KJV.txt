23:55:001:0	Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters , and he that hath no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
23:55:002:0	Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not ? hearken diligently unto me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
23:55:003:0	Incline your ear , and come unto me : hear , and your soul shall live ; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you , even the sure mercies of David .
23:55:004:0	Behold , I have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
23:55:005:0	Behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the thy God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
23:55:006:0	Seek ye the while he may be found , call ye upon him while he is near :
23:55:007:0	Let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
23:55:008:0	For my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith the .
23:55:009:0	For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
23:55:010:0	For as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
23:55:011:0	So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
23:55:012:0	For ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
23:55:013:0	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off .
