23:42:001:0	Behold my servant , whom I uphold ; mine elect , in whom my soul delighteth ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles .
23:42:002:0	He shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause his voice to be heard in the street .
23:42:003:0	A bruised reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
23:42:004:0	He shall not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isles shall wait for his law .
23:42:005:0	Thus saith God the Lord , he that created the heavens , and stretched them out ; he that spread forth the earth , and that which cometh out of it ; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein :
23:42:006:0	I the Lord have called thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles ;
23:42:007:0	To open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house .
23:42:008:0	I am the Lord : that is my name : and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to graven images .
23:42:009:0	Behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
23:42:010:0	Sing unto the Lord a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that is therein ; the isles , and the inhabitants thereof .
23:42:011:0	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
23:42:012:0	Let them give glory unto the Lord , and declare his praise in the islands .
23:42:013:0	The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
23:42:014:0	I have long time holden my peace ; I have been still , and refrained myself : now will I cry like a travailing woman ; I will destroy and devour at once .
23:42:015:0	I will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
23:42:016:0	And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not ; I will lead them in paths that they have not known : I will make darkness light before them , and crooked things straight . These things will I do unto them , and not forsake them .
23:42:017:0	They shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in graven images , that say to the molten images , Ye are our gods .
23:42:018:0	Hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
23:42:019:0	Who is blind , but my servant ? or deaf , as my messenger that I sent ? who is blind as he that is perfect , and blind as the Lord's servant ?
23:42:020:0	Seeing many things , but thou observest not ; opening the ears , but he heareth not .
23:42:021:0	The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake ; he will magnify the law , and make it honourable .
23:42:022:0	But this is a people robbed and spoiled ; they are all of them snared in holes , and they are hid in prison houses : they are for a prey , and none delivereth ; for a spoil , and none saith , Restore .
23:42:023:0	Who among you will give ear to this ? who will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
23:42:024:0	Who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the robbers ? did not the Lord , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
23:42:025:0	Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger , and the strength of battle : and it hath set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
