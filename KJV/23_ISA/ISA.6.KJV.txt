23:6:001:0	In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up , and his train filled the temple .
23:6:002:0	Above it stood the seraphims : each one had six wings ; with twain he covered his face , and with twain he covered his feet , and with twain he did fly .
23:6:003:0	And one cried unto another , and said , Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
23:6:004:0	And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
23:6:005:0	Then said I , Woe is me ! for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the Lord of hosts .
23:6:006:0	Then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
23:6:007:0	And he laid it upon my mouth , and said , Lo , this hath touched thy lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away , and thy sin purged .
23:6:008:0	Also I heard the voice of the Lord , saying , Whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? Then said I , Here am I ; send me .
23:6:009:0	And he said , Go , and tell this people , Hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not .
23:6:010:0	Make the heart of this people fat , and make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and convert , and be healed .
23:6:011:0	Then said I , Lord , how long ? And he answered , Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land be utterly desolate ,
23:6:012:0	And the Lord have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
23:6:013:0	But yet in it shall be a tenth , and it shall return , and shall be eaten : as a teil tree , and as an oak , whose substance is in them , when they cast their leaves : so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof .
