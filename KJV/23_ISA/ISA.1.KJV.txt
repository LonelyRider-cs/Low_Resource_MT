23:1:001:0	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
23:1:002:0	Hear , O heavens , and give ear , O earth : for the Lord hath spoken , I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me .
23:1:003:0	The ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master's crib : but Israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
23:1:004:0	Ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children that are corrupters : they have forsaken the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger , they are gone away backward .
23:1:005:0	Why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
23:1:006:0	From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
23:1:007:0	Your country is desolate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers devour it in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
23:1:008:0	And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
23:1:009:0	Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as Sodom , and we should have been like unto Gomorrah .
23:1:010:0	Hear the word of the Lord , ye rulers of Sodom ; give ear unto the law of our God , ye people of Gomorrah .
23:1:011:0	To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? saith the Lord : I am full of the burnt offerings of rams , and the fat of fed beasts ; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks , or of lambs , or of he goats .
23:1:012:0	When ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to tread my courts ?
23:1:013:0	Bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , I cannot away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
23:1:014:0	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth : they are a trouble unto me ; I am weary to bear them .
23:1:015:0	And when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : yea , when ye make many prayers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
23:1:016:0	Wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
23:1:017:0	Learn to do well ; seek judgment , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
23:1:018:0	Come now , and let us reason together , saith the Lord : though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool .
23:1:019:0	If ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land :
23:1:020:0	But if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it .
23:1:021:0	How is the faithful city become an harlot ! it was full of judgment ; righteousness lodged in it ; but now murderers .
23:1:022:0	Thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water :
23:1:023:0	Thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
23:1:024:0	Therefore saith the Lord , the Lord of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies :
23:1:025:0	And I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin :
23:1:026:0	And I will restore thy judges as at the first , and thy counsellors as at the beginning : afterward thou shalt be called , The city of righteousness , the faithful city .
23:1:027:0	Zion shall be redeemed with judgment , and her converts with righteousness .
23:1:028:0	And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together , and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed .
23:1:029:0	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired , and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen .
23:1:030:0	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that hath no water .
23:1:031:0	And the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
