23:53:001:0	Who hath believed our report ? and to whom is the arm of the revealed ?
23:53:002:0	For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground : he hath no form nor comeliness ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
23:53:003:0	He is despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was despised , and we esteemed him not .
23:53:004:0	Surely he hath borne our griefs , and carried our sorrows : yet we did esteem him stricken , smitten of God , and afflicted .
23:53:005:0	But he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed .
23:53:006:0	All we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the hath laid on him the iniquity of us all .
23:53:007:0	He was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
23:53:008:0	He was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the living : for the transgression of my people was he stricken .
23:53:009:0	And he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
23:53:010:0	Yet it pleased the to bruise him ; he hath put him to grief : when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin , he shall see his seed , he shall prolong his days , and the pleasure of the shall prosper in his hand .
23:53:011:0	He shall see of the travail of his soul , and shall be satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many ; for he shall bear their iniquities .
23:53:012:0	Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great , and he shall divide the spoil with the strong ; because he hath poured out his soul unto death : and he was numbered with the transgressors ; and he bare the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors .
