8:1:001:0	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . And a certain man of Beth–lehem–judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
8:1:002:0	And the name of the man was Elimelech , and the name of his wife Naomi , and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of Beth–lehem–judah . And they came into the country of Moab , and continued there .
8:1:003:0	And Elimelech Naomi's husband died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
8:1:004:0	And they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they dwelled there about ten years .
8:1:005:0	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them ; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband .
8:1:006:0	Then she arose with her daughters in law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
8:1:007:0	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
8:1:008:0	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother's house : the Lord deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
8:1:009:0	The Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . Then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
8:1:010:0	And they said unto her , Surely we will return with thee unto thy people .
8:1:011:0	And Naomi said , Turn again , my daughters : why will ye go with me ? are there yet any more sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
8:1:012:0	Turn again , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . If I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
8:1:013:0	Would ye tarry for them till they were grown ? would ye stay for them from having husbands ? nay , my daughters ; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me .
8:1:014:0	And they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother in law ; but Ruth clave unto her .
8:1:015:0	And she said , Behold , thy sister in law is gone back unto her people , and unto her gods : return thou after thy sister in law .
8:1:016:0	And Ruth said , Entreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee : for whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God :
8:1:017:0	Where thou diest , will I die , and there will I be buried : the Lord do so to me , and more also , if ought but death part thee and me .
8:1:018:0	When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , then she left speaking unto her .
8:1:019:0	So they two went until they came to Beth–lehem . And it came to pass , when they were come to Beth–lehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Naomi ?
8:1:020:0	And she said unto them , Call me not Naomi , call me Mara : for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me .
8:1:021:0	I went out full , and the Lord hath brought me home again empty : why then call ye me Naomi , seeing the Lord hath testified against me , and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?
8:1:022:0	So Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Beth–lehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
