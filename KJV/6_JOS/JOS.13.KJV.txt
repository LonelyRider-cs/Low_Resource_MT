6:13:001:0	Now Joshua was old and stricken in years ; and the said unto him , Thou art old and stricken in years , and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed .
6:13:002:0	This is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the Philistines , and all Geshuri ,
6:13:003:0	From Sihor , which is before Egypt , even unto the borders of Ekron northward , which is counted to the Canaanite : five lords of the Philistines ; the Gazites , and the Ashdothites , the Eshkalonites , the Gittites , and the Ekronites ; also the Avites :
6:13:004:0	From the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians , unto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites :
6:13:005:0	And the land of the Giblites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrising , from Baal–gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath .
6:13:006:0	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth–maim , and all the Sidonians , them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance , as I have commanded thee .
6:13:007:0	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and the half tribe of Manasseh ,
6:13:008:0	With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the gave them ;
6:13:009:0	From Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ;
6:13:010:0	And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ;
6:13:011:0	And Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and all mount Hermon , and all Bashan unto Salecah ;
6:13:012:0	All the kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
6:13:013:0	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites , nor the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
6:13:014:0	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance ; the sacrifices of the God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance , as he said unto them .
6:13:015:0	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families .
6:13:016:0	And their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
6:13:017:0	Heshbon , and all her cities that are in the plain ; Dibon , and Bamoth–baal , and Beth–baal–meon ,
6:13:018:0	And Jahzah , and Kedemoth , and Mephaath ,
6:13:019:0	And Kiriathaim , and Sibmah , and Zereth–shahar in the mount of the valley ,
6:13:020:0	And Beth–peor , and Ashdoth–pisgah , and Beth–jeshimoth ,
6:13:021:0	And all the cities of the plain , and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , which were dukes of Sihon , dwelling in the country .
6:13:022:0	Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them .
6:13:023:0	And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof . This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
6:13:024:0	And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families .
6:13:025:0	And their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
6:13:026:0	And from Heshbon unto Ramath–mizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir ;
6:13:027:0	And in the valley , Beth–haram , and Beth–nimrah , and Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , Jordan and his border , even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward .
6:13:028:0	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families , the cities , and their villages .
6:13:029:0	And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families .
6:13:030:0	And their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities :
6:13:031:0	And half Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families .
6:13:032:0	These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab , on the other side Jordan , by Jericho , eastward .
6:13:033:0	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance : the God of Israel was their inheritance , as he said unto them .
