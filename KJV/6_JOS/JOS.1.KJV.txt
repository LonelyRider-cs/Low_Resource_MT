6:1:001:0	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun , Moses' minister , saying ,
6:1:002:0	Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
6:1:003:0	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
6:1:004:0	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
6:1:005:0	There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
6:1:006:0	Be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give them .
6:1:007:0	Only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law , which Moses my servant commanded thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest .
6:1:008:0	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
6:1:009:0	Have not I commanded thee ? Be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
6:1:010:0	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
6:1:011:0	Pass through the host , and command the people , saying , Prepare you victuals ; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan , to go in to possess the land , which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it .
6:1:012:0	And to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to half the tribe of Manasseh , spake Joshua , saying ,
6:1:013:0	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying , The Lord your God hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
6:1:014:0	Your wives , your little ones , and your cattle , shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan ; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed , all the mighty men of valour , and help them ;
6:1:015:0	Until the Lord have given your brethren rest , as he hath given you , and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them : then ye shall return unto the land of your possession , and enjoy it , which Moses the Lord's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising .
6:1:016:0	And they answered Joshua , saying , All that thou commandest us we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest us , we will go .
6:1:017:0	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things , so will we hearken unto thee : only the Lord thy God be with thee , as he was with Moses .
6:1:018:0	Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
