6:9:001:0	And it came to pass , when all the kings which were on this side Jordan , in the hills , and in the valleys , and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon , the Hittite , and the Amorite , the Canaanite , the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , heard thereof ;
6:9:002:0	That they gathered themselves together , to fight with Joshua and with Israel , with one accord .
6:9:003:0	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai ,
6:9:004:0	They did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
6:9:005:0	And old shoes and clouted upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy .
6:9:006:0	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
6:9:007:0	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites , Peradventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
6:9:008:0	And they said unto Joshua , We are thy servants . And Joshua said unto them , Who are ye ? and from whence come ye ?
6:9:009:0	And they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
6:9:010:0	And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites , that were beyond Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , which was at Ashtaroth .
6:9:011:0	Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us , saying , Take victuals with you for the journey , and go to meet them , and say unto them , We are your servants : therefore now make ye a league with us .
6:9:012:0	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
6:9:013:0	And these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
6:9:014:0	And the men took of their victuals , and asked not counsel at the mouth of the .
6:9:015:0	And Joshua made peace with them , and made a league with them , to let them live : and the princes of the congregation sware unto them .
6:9:016:0	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
6:9:017:0	And the children of Israel journeyed , and came unto their cities on the third day . Now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjathâ€“jearim .
6:9:018:0	And the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the God of Israel . And all the congregation murmured against the princes .
6:9:019:0	But all the princes said unto all the congregation , We have sworn unto them by the God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
6:9:020:0	This we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
6:9:021:0	And the princes said unto them , Let them live ; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation ; as the princes had promised them .
6:9:022:0	And Joshua called for them , and he spake unto them , saying , Wherefore have ye beguiled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye dwell among us ?
6:9:023:0	Now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God .
6:9:024:0	And they answered Joshua , and said , Because it was certainly told thy servants , how that the thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you , therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you , and have done this thing .
6:9:025:0	And now , behold , we are in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us , do .
6:9:026:0	And so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
6:9:027:0	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation , and for the altar of the , even unto this day , in the place which he should choose .
