6:2:001:0	And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly , saying , Go view the land , even Jericho . And they went , and came into an harlot 's house , named Rahab , and lodged there .
6:2:002:0	And it was told the king of Jericho , saying , Behold , there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country .
6:2:003:0	And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab , saying , Bring forth the men that are come to thee , which are entered into thine house : for they be come to search out all the country .
6:2:004:0	And the woman took the two men , and hid them , and said thus , There came men unto me , but I wist not whence they were :
6:2:005:0	And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
6:2:006:0	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
6:2:007:0	And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
6:2:008:0	And before they were laid down , she came up unto them upon the roof ;
6:2:009:0	And she said unto the men , I know that the hath given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
6:2:010:0	For we have heard how the dried up the water of the Red sea for you , when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites , that were on the other side Jordan , Sihon and Og , whom ye utterly destroyed .
6:2:011:0	And as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
6:2:012:0	Now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the , since I have shewed you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father 's house , and give me a true token :
6:2:013:0	And that ye will save alive my father , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sisters , and all that they have , and deliver our lives from death .
6:2:014:0	And the men answered her , Our life for yours , if ye utter not this our business . And it shall be , when the hath given us the land , that we will deal kindly and truly with thee .
6:2:015:0	Then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house was upon the town wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
6:2:016:0	And she said unto them , Get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
6:2:017:0	And the men said unto her , We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear .
6:2:018:0	Behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by : and thou shalt bring thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father 's household , home unto thee .
6:2:019:0	And it shall be , that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street , his blood shall be upon his head , and we will be guiltless : and whosoever shall be with thee in the house , his blood shall be on our head , if any hand be upon him .
6:2:020:0	And if thou utter this our business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
6:2:021:0	And she said , According unto your words , so be it . And she sent them away , and they departed : and she bound the scarlet line in the window .
6:2:022:0	And they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
6:2:023:0	So the two men returned , and descended from the mountain , and passed over , and came to Joshua the son of Nun , and told him all things that befell them :
6:2:024:0	And they said unto Joshua , Truly the hath delivered into our hands all the land ; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us .
