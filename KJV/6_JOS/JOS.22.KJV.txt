6:22:001:0	Then Joshua called the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh ,
6:22:002:0	And said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
6:22:003:0	Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the your God .
6:22:004:0	And now the your God hath given rest unto your brethren , as he promised them : therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents , and unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the gave you on the other side Jordan .
6:22:005:0	But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law , which Moses the servant of the charged you , to love the your God , and to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and to cleave unto him , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul .
6:22:006:0	So Joshua blessed them , and sent them away : and they went unto their tents .
6:22:007:0	Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward . And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
6:22:008:0	And he spake unto them , saying , Return with much riches unto your tents , and with very much cattle , with silver , and with gold , and with brass , and with iron , and with very much raiment : divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren .
6:22:009:0	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go unto the country of Gilead , to the land of their possession , whereof they were possessed , according to the word of the by the hand of Moses .
6:22:010:0	And when they came unto the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan , a great altar to see to .
6:22:011:0	And the children of Israel heard say , Behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
6:22:012:0	And when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
6:22:013:0	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
6:22:014:0	And with him ten princes , of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel .
6:22:015:0	And they came unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
6:22:016:0	Thus saith the whole congregation of the , What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the , in that ye have builded you an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the ?
6:22:017:0	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the ,
6:22:018:0	But that ye must turn away this day from following the ? and it will be , seeing ye rebel to day against the , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel .
6:22:019:0	Notwithstanding , if the land of your possession be unclean , then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the , wherein the tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession among us : but rebel not against the , nor rebel against us , in building you an altar beside the altar of the our God .
6:22:020:0	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel ? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity .
6:22:021:0	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered , and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
6:22:022:0	The God of gods , the God of gods , he knoweth , and Israel he shall know ; if it be in rebellion , or if in transgression against the , ( save us not this day , )
6:22:023:0	That we have built us an altar to turn from following the , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the himself require it ;
6:22:024:0	And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the God of Israel ?
6:22:025:0	For the hath made Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Reuben and children of Gad ; ye have no part in the : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the .
6:22:026:0	Therefore we said , Let us now prepare to build us an altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice :
6:22:027:0	But that it may be a witness between us , and you , and our generations after us , that we might do the service of the before him with our burnt offerings , and with our sacrifices , and with our peace offerings ; that your children may not say to our children in time to come , Ye have no part in the .
6:22:028:0	Therefore said we , that it shall be , when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come , that we may say again , Behold the pattern of the altar of the , which our fathers made , not for burnt offerings , nor for sacrifices ; but it is a witness between us and you .
6:22:029:0	God forbid that we should rebel against the , and turn this day from following the , to build an altar for burnt offerings , for meat offerings , or for sacrifices , beside the altar of the our God that is before his tabernacle .
6:22:030:0	And when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
6:22:031:0	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the children of Manasseh , This day we perceive that the is among us , because ye have not committed this trespass against the : now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the .
6:22:032:0	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , unto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
6:22:033:0	And the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and did not intend to go up against them in battle , to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt .
6:22:034:0	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed : for it shall be a witness between us that the is God .
