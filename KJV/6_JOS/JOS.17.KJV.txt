6:17:001:0	There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of Joseph ; to wit , for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
6:17:002:0	There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families ; for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families .
6:17:003:0	But Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
6:17:004:0	And they came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying , The commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren . Therefore according to the commandment of the he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
6:17:005:0	And there fell ten portions to Manasseh , beside the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side Jordan ;
6:17:006:0	Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons : and the rest of Manasseh 's sons had the land of Gilead .
6:17:007:0	And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En–tappuah .
6:17:008:0	Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah : but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim ;
6:17:009:0	And the coast descended unto the river Kanah , southward of the river : these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh : the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and the outgoings of it were at the sea :
6:17:010:0	Southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north , and in Issachar on the east .
6:17:011:0	And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth–shean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
6:17:012:0	Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
6:17:013:0	Yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute ; but did not utterly drive them out .
6:17:014:0	And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the hath blessed me hitherto ?
6:17:015:0	And Joshua answered them , If thou be a great people , then get thee up to the wood country , and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants , if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee .
6:17:016:0	And the children of Joseph said , The hill is not enough for us : and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , both they who are of Beth–shean and her towns , and they who are of the valley of Jezreel .
6:17:017:0	And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
6:17:018:0	But the mountain shall be thine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the outgoings of it shall be thine : for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they be strong .
