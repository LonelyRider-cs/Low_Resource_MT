6:15:001:0	This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
6:15:002:0	And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward :
6:15:003:0	And it went out to the south side to Maaleh–acrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh–barnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and fetched a compass to Karkaa :
6:15:004:0	From thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
6:15:005:0	And the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :

6:15:007:0	And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En–shemesh , and the goings out thereof were at En–rogel :
6:15:008:0	And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite ; the same is Jerusalem : and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward , which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward :
6:15:009:0	And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath–jearim :
6:15:010:0	And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth–shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
6:15:011:0	And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
6:15:012:0	And the west border was to the great sea , and the coast thereof . This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
6:15:013:0	And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua , even the city of Arba the father of Anak , which city is Hebron .
6:15:014:0	And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
6:15:015:0	And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath–sepher .
6:15:016:0	And Caleb said , He that smiteth Kirjath–sepher , and taketh it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife .
6:15:017:0	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , took it : and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife .
6:15:018:0	And it came to pass , as she came unto him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she lighted off her ass ; and Caleb said unto her , What wouldest thou ?
6:15:019:0	Who answered , Give me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . And he gave her the upper springs , and the nether springs .
6:15:020:0	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
