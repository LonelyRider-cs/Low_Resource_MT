6:24:001:0	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
6:24:002:0	And Joshua said unto all the people , Thus saith the God of Israel , Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time , even Terah , the father of Abraham , and the father of Nahor : and they served other gods .
6:24:003:0	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
6:24:004:0	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
6:24:005:0	I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them : and afterward I brought you out .
6:24:006:0	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and ye came unto the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea .
6:24:007:0	And when they cried unto the , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
6:24:008:0	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
6:24:009:0	Then Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and warred against Israel , and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you :
6:24:010:0	But I would not hearken unto Balaam ; therefore he blessed you still : so I delivered you out of his hand .
6:24:011:0	And ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
6:24:012:0	And I sent the hornet before you , which drave them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
6:24:013:0	And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour , and cities which ye built not , and ye dwell in them ; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat .
6:24:014:0	Now therefore fear the , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the .
6:24:015:0	And if it seem evil unto you to serve the , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood , or the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but as for me and my house , we will serve the .
6:24:016:0	And the people answered and said , God forbid that we should forsake the , to serve other gods ;
6:24:017:0	For the our God , he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage , and which did those great signs in our sight , and preserved us in all the way wherein we went , and among all the people through whom we passed :
6:24:018:0	And the drave out from before us all the people , even the Amorites which dwelt in the land : therefore will we also serve the ; for he is our God .
6:24:019:0	And Joshua said unto the people , Ye can not serve the : for he is an holy God ; he is a jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
6:24:020:0	If ye forsake the , and serve strange gods , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
6:24:021:0	And the people said unto Joshua , Nay ; but we will serve the .
6:24:022:0	And Joshua said unto the people , Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the , to serve him . And they said , We are witnesses .
6:24:023:0	Now therefore put away , said he , the strange gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto the God of Israel .
6:24:024:0	And the people said unto Joshua , The our God will we serve , and his voice will we obey .
6:24:025:0	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem .
6:24:026:0	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the .
6:24:027:0	And Joshua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God .
6:24:028:0	So Joshua let the people depart , every man unto his inheritance .
6:24:029:0	And it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
6:24:030:0	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathâ€“serah , which is in mount Ephraim , on the north side of the hill of Gaash .
6:24:031:0	And Israel served the all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the , that he had done for Israel .
6:24:032:0	And the bones of Joseph , which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt , buried they in Shechem , in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver : and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph .
6:24:033:0	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son , which was given him in mount Ephraim .
