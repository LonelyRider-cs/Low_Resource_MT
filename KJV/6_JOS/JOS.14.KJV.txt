6:14:001:0	And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
6:14:002:0	By lot was their inheritance , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half tribe .
6:14:003:0	For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them .
6:14:004:0	For the children of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim : therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land , save cities to dwell in , with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance .
6:14:005:0	As the Lord commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did , and they divided the land .
6:14:006:0	Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal : and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him , Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh–barnea .
6:14:007:0	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh–barnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
6:14:008:0	Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt : but I wholly followed the Lord my God .
6:14:009:0	And Moses sware on that day , saying , Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance , and thy children's for ever , because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God .
6:14:010:0	And now , behold , the Lord hath kept me alive , as he said , these forty and five years , even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses , while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness : and now , lo , I am this day fourscore and five years old .
6:14:011:0	As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
6:14:012:0	Now therefore give me this mountain , whereof the Lord spake in that day ; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there , and that the cities were great and fenced : if so be the Lord will be with me , then I shall be able to drive them out , as the Lord said .
6:14:013:0	And Joshua blessed him , and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance .
6:14:014:0	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day , because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel .
6:14:015:0	And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath–arba ; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims . And the land had rest from war .
