60:5:001:0	The elders which are among you I exhort , who am also an elder , and a witness of the sufferings of Christ , and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed :
60:5:002:0	Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
60:5:003:0	Neither as being lords over God 's heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .
60:5:004:0	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
60:5:005:0	Likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
60:5:006:0	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time :
60:5:007:0	Casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for you .
60:5:008:0	Be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
60:5:009:0	Whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
60:5:010:0	But the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
60:5:011:0	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
60:5:012:0	By Silvanus , a faithful brother unto you , as I suppose , I have written briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand .
60:5:013:0	The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Mark my son .
60:5:014:0	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
