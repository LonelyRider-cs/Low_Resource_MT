60:2:001:0	Wherefore laying aside all malice , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , and all evil speakings ,
60:2:002:0	As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
60:2:003:0	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
60:2:004:0	To whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
60:2:005:0	Ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
60:2:006:0	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
60:2:007:0	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious : but unto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner ,
60:2:008:0	And a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
60:2:009:0	But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
60:2:010:0	Which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
60:2:011:0	Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
60:2:012:0	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
60:2:013:0	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
60:2:014:0	Or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of them that do well .
60:2:015:0	For so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
60:2:016:0	As free , and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness , but as the servants of God .
60:2:017:0	Honour all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honour the king .
60:2:018:0	Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
60:2:019:0	For this is thankworthy , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suffering wrongfully .
60:2:020:0	For what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
60:2:021:0	For even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps :
60:2:022:0	Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth :
60:2:023:0	Who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
60:2:024:0	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
60:2:025:0	For ye were as sheep going astray ; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls .
