22:8:001:0	O that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! when I should find thee without , I would kiss thee ; yea , I should not be despised .
22:8:002:0	I would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
22:8:003:0	His left hand should be under my head , and his right hand should embrace me .
22:8:004:0	I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , until he please .
22:8:005:0	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised thee up under the apple tree : there thy mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
22:8:006:0	Set me as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm : for love is strong as death ; jealousy is cruel as the grave : the coals thereof are coals of fire , which hath a most vehement flame .
22:8:007:0	Many waters can not quench love , neither can the floods drown it : if a man would give all the substance of his house for love , it would utterly be contemned .
22:8:008:0	We have a little sister , and she hath no breasts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ?
22:8:009:0	If she be a wall , we will build upon her a palace of silver : and if she be a door , we will inclose her with boards of cedar .
22:8:010:0	I am a wall , and my breasts like towers : then was I in his eyes as one that found favour .
22:8:011:0	Solomon had a vineyard at Baalâ€“hamon ; he let out the vineyard unto keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
22:8:012:0	My vineyard , which is mine , is before me : thou , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
22:8:013:0	Thou that dwellest in the gardens , the companions hearken to thy voice : cause me to hear it .
22:8:014:0	Make haste , my beloved , and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices .
