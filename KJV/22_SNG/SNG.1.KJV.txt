22:1:001:0	The song of songs , which is Solomon 's .
22:1:002:0	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth : for thy love is better than wine .
22:1:003:0	Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth , therefore do the virgins love thee .
22:1:004:0	Draw me , we will run after thee : the king hath brought me into his chambers : we will be glad and rejoice in thee , we will remember thy love more than wine : the upright love thee .
22:1:005:0	I am black , but comely , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , as the tents of Kedar , as the curtains of Solomon .
22:1:006:0	Look not upon me , because I am black , because the sun hath looked upon me : my mother 's children were angry with me ; they made me the keeper of the vineyards ; but mine own vineyard have I not kept .
22:1:007:0	Tell me , O thou whom my soul loveth , where thou feedest , where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon : for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions ?
22:1:008:0	If thou know not , O thou fairest among women , go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock , and feed thy kids beside the shepherds ' tents .
22:1:009:0	I have compared thee , O my love , to a company of horses in Pharaoh 's chariots .
22:1:010:0	Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels , thy neck with chains of gold .
22:1:011:0	We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver .
22:1:012:0	While the king sitteth at his table , my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof .
22:1:013:0	A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me ; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts .
22:1:014:0	My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Enâ€“gedi .
22:1:015:0	Behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast doves ' eyes .
22:1:016:0	Behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant : also our bed is green .
22:1:017:0	The beams of our house are cedar , and our rafters of fir .
