22:4:001:0	Behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast doves ' eyes within thy locks : thy hair is as a flock of goats , that appear from mount Gilead .
22:4:002:0	Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn , which came up from the washing ; whereof every one bear twins , and none is barren among them .
22:4:003:0	Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .
22:4:004:0	Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury , whereon there hang a thousand bucklers , all shields of mighty men .
22:4:005:0	Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins , which feed among the lilies .
22:4:006:0	Until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
22:4:007:0	Thou art all fair , my love ; there is no spot in thee .
22:4:008:0	Come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of Amana , from the top of Senir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
22:4:009:0	Thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my spouse ; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of thy neck .
22:4:010:0	How fair is thy love , my sister , my spouse ! how much better is thy love than wine ! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices !
22:4:011:0	Thy lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
22:4:012:0	A garden inclosed is my sister , my spouse ; a spring shut up , a fountain sealed .
22:4:013:0	Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates , with pleasant fruits ; camphire , with spikenard ,
22:4:014:0	Spikenard and saffron ; calamus and cinnamon , with all trees of frankincense ; myrrh and aloes , with all the chief spices :
22:4:015:0	A fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , and streams from Lebanon .
22:4:016:0	Awake , O north wind ; and come , thou south ; blow upon my garden , that the spices thereof may flow out . Let my beloved come into his garden , and eat his pleasant fruits .
