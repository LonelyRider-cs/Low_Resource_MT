22:6:001:0	Whither is thy beloved gone , O thou fairest among women ? whither is thy beloved turned aside ? that we may seek him with thee .
22:6:002:0	My beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
22:6:003:0	I am my beloved 's , and my beloved is mine : he feedeth among the lilies .
22:6:004:0	Thou art beautiful , O my love , as Tirzah , comely as Jerusalem , terrible as an army with banners .
22:6:005:0	Turn away thine eyes from me , for they have overcome me : thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead .
22:6:006:0	Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing , whereof every one beareth twins , and there is not one barren among them .
22:6:007:0	As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks .
22:6:008:0	There are threescore queens , and fourscore concubines , and virgins without number .
22:6:009:0	My dove , my undefiled is but one ; she is the only one of her mother , she is the choice one of her that bare her . The daughters saw her , and blessed her ; yea , the queens and the concubines , and they praised her .
22:6:010:0	Who is she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ?
22:6:011:0	I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranates budded .
22:6:012:0	Or ever I was aware , my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib .
22:6:013:0	Return , return , O Shulamite ; return , return , that we may look upon thee . What will ye see in the Shulamite ? As it were the company of two armies .
