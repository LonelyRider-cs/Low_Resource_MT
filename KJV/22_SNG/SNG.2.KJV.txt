22:2:001:0	I am the rose of Sharon , and the lily of the valleys .
22:2:002:0	As the lily among thorns , so is my love among the daughters .
22:2:003:0	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
22:2:004:0	He brought me to the banqueting house , and his banner over me was love .
22:2:005:0	Stay me with flagons , comfort me with apples : for I am sick of love .
22:2:006:0	His left hand is under my head , and his right hand doth embrace me .
22:2:007:0	I charge you , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
22:2:008:0	The voice of my beloved ! behold , he cometh leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills .
22:2:009:0	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart : behold , he standeth behind our wall , he looketh forth at the windows , shewing himself through the lattice .
22:2:010:0	My beloved spake , and said unto me , Rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
22:2:011:0	For , lo , the winter is past , the rain is over and gone ;
22:2:012:0	The flowers appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ;
22:2:013:0	The fig tree putteth forth her green figs , and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell . Arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
22:2:014:0	O my dove , that art in the clefts of the rock , in the secret places of the stairs , let me see thy countenance , let me hear thy voice ; for sweet is thy voice , and thy countenance is comely .
22:2:015:0	Take us the foxes , the little foxes , that spoil the vines : for our vines have tender grapes .
22:2:016:0	My beloved is mine , and I am his : he feedeth among the lilies .
22:2:017:0	Until the day break , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether .
