4:15:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:15:002:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
4:15:003:0	And will make an offering by fire unto the Lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the Lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
4:15:004:0	Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
4:15:005:0	And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
4:15:006:0	Or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil .
4:15:007:0	And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
4:15:008:0	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the Lord :
4:15:009:0	Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil .
4:15:010:0	And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
4:15:011:0	Thus shall it be done for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
4:15:012:0	According to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
4:15:013:0	All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
4:15:014:0	And if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
4:15:015:0	One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord .
4:15:016:0	One law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
4:15:017:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:15:018:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you ,
4:15:019:0	Then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord .
4:15:020:0	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
4:15:021:0	Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave offering in your generations .
4:15:022:0	And if ye have erred , and not observed all these commandments , which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses ,
4:15:023:0	Even all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses , from the day that the Lord commanded Moses , and henceforward among your generations ;
4:15:024:0	Then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
4:15:025:0	And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignorance :
4:15:026:0	And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
4:15:027:0	And if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
4:15:028:0	And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
4:15:029:0	Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
4:15:030:0	But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
4:15:031:0	Because he hath despised the word of the Lord , and hath broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be upon him .
4:15:032:0	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
4:15:033:0	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron , and unto all the congregation .
4:15:034:0	And they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
4:15:035:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , The man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
4:15:036:0	And all the congregation brought him without the camp , and stoned him with stones , and he died ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
4:15:037:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:15:038:0	Speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue :
4:15:039:0	And it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring :
4:15:040:0	That ye may remember , and do all my commandments , and be holy unto your God .
4:15:041:0	I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the Lord your God .
