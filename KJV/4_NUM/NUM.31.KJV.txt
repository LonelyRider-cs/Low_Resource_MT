4:31:001:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:31:002:0	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites : afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people .
4:31:003:0	And Moses spake unto the people , saying , Arm some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Midianites , and avenge the Lord of Midian .
4:31:004:0	Of every tribe a thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , shall ye send to the war .
4:31:005:0	So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
4:31:006:0	And Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
4:31:007:0	And they warred against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses ; and they slew all the males .
4:31:008:0	And they slew the kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slain ; namely , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
4:31:009:0	And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
4:31:010:0	And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt , and all their goodly castles , with fire .
4:31:011:0	And they took all the spoil , and all the prey , both of men and of beasts .
4:31:012:0	And they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
4:31:013:0	And Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the congregation , went forth to meet them without the camp .
4:31:014:0	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
4:31:015:0	And Moses said unto them , Have ye saved all the women alive ?
4:31:016:0	Behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord .
4:31:017:0	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
4:31:018:0	But all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
4:31:019:0	And do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
4:31:020:0	And purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats' hair , and all things made of wood .
4:31:021:0	And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle , This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses ;
4:31:022:0	Only the gold , and the silver , the brass , the iron , the tin , and the lead ,
4:31:023:0	Every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
4:31:024:0	And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
4:31:025:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:31:026:0	Take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou , and Eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the congregation :
4:31:027:0	And divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the congregation :
4:31:028:0	And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
4:31:029:0	Take it of their half , and give it unto Eleazar the priest , for an heave offering of the Lord .
4:31:030:0	And of the children of Israel's half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the persons , of the beeves , of the asses , and of the flocks , of all manner of beasts , and give them unto the Levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord .
4:31:031:0	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses .
4:31:032:0	And the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
4:31:033:0	And threescore and twelve thousand beeves ,
4:31:034:0	And threescore and one thousand asses ,
4:31:035:0	And thirty and two thousand persons in all , of women that had not known man by lying with him .
4:31:036:0	And the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep :
4:31:037:0	And the Lord's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen .
4:31:038:0	And the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the Lord's tribute was threescore and twelve .
4:31:039:0	And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred ; of which the Lord's tribute was threescore and one .
4:31:040:0	And the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the Lord's tribute was thirty and two persons .
4:31:041:0	And Moses gave the tribute , which was the Lord's heave offering , unto Eleazar the priest , as the Lord commanded Moses .
4:31:042:0	And of the children of Israel's half , which Moses divided from the men that warred ,
4:31:043:0	( Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
4:31:044:0	And thirty and six thousand beeves ,
4:31:045:0	And thirty thousand asses and five hundred ,
4:31:046:0	And sixteen thousand persons ; )
4:31:047:0	Even of the children of Israel's half , Moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the Levites , which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
4:31:048:0	And the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto Moses :
4:31:049:0	And they said unto Moses , Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
4:31:050:0	We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord , what every man hath gotten , of jewels of gold , chains , and bracelets , rings , earrings , and tablets , to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord .
4:31:051:0	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them , even all wrought jewels .
4:31:052:0	And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
4:31:053:0	( For the men of war had taken spoil , every man for himself . )
4:31:054:0	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation , for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .
