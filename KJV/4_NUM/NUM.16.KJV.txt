4:16:001:0	Now Korah , the son of Izhar , the son of Kohath , the son of Levi , and Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , and On , the son of Peleth , sons of Reuben , took men :
4:16:002:0	And they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown :
4:16:003:0	And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron , and said unto them , Ye take too much upon you , seeing all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the is among them : wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the ?
4:16:004:0	And when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face :
4:16:005:0	And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company , saying , Even to morrow the will shew who are his , and who is holy ; and will cause him to come near unto him : even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him .
4:16:006:0	This do ; Take you censers , Korah , and all his company ;
4:16:007:0	And put fire therein , and put incense in them before the to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi .
4:16:008:0	And Moses said unto Korah , Hear , I pray you , ye sons of Levi :
4:16:009:0	Seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
4:16:010:0	And he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
4:16:011:0	For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the : and what is Aaron , that ye murmur against him ?
4:16:012:0	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab : which said , We will not come up :
4:16:013:0	Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
4:16:014:0	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up .
4:16:015:0	And Moses was very wroth , and said unto the , Respect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
4:16:016:0	And Moses said unto Korah , Be thou and all thy company before the , thou , and they , and Aaron , to morrow :
4:16:017:0	And take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also , and Aaron , each of you his censer .
4:16:018:0	And they took every man his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron .
4:16:019:0	And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the glory of the appeared unto all the congregation .
4:16:020:0	And the spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
4:16:021:0	Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment .
4:16:022:0	And they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
4:16:023:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:16:024:0	Speak unto the congregation , saying , Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram .
4:16:025:0	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
4:16:026:0	And he spake unto the congregation , saying , Depart , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins .
4:16:027:0	So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
4:16:028:0	And Moses said , Hereby ye shall know that the hath sent me to do all these works ; for I have not done them of mine own mind .
4:16:029:0	If these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the visitation of all men ; then the hath not sent me .
4:16:030:0	But if the make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the .
4:16:031:0	And it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground clave asunder that was under them :
4:16:032:0	And the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
4:16:033:0	They , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the congregation .
4:16:034:0	And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them : for they said , Lest the earth swallow us up also .
4:16:035:0	And there came out a fire from the , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense .
4:16:036:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:16:037:0	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder ; for they are hallowed .
4:16:038:0	The censers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar : for they offered them before the , therefore they are hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel .
4:16:039:0	And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers , wherewith they that were burnt had offered ; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar :
4:16:040:0	To be a memorial unto the children of Israel , that no stranger , which is not of the seed of Aaron , come near to offer incense before the ; that he be not as Korah , and as his company : as the said to him by the hand of Moses .
4:16:041:0	But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye have killed the people of the .
4:16:042:0	And it came to pass , when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation : and , behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the appeared .
4:16:043:0	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation .
4:16:044:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:16:045:0	Get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment . And they fell upon their faces .
4:16:046:0	And Moses said unto Aaron , Take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the ; the plague is begun .
4:16:047:0	And Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
4:16:048:0	And he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed .
4:16:049:0	Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside them that died about the matter of Korah .
4:16:050:0	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the plague was stayed .
