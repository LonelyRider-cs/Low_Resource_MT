4:14:001:0	And all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
4:14:002:0	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
4:14:003:0	And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ? were it not better for us to return into Egypt ?
4:14:004:0	And they said one to another , Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt .
4:14:005:0	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
4:14:006:0	And Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
4:14:007:0	And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
4:14:008:0	If the Lord delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
4:14:009:0	Only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the Lord is with us : fear them not .
4:14:010:0	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones . And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel .
4:14:011:0	And the Lord said unto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ere they believe me , for all the signs which I have shewed among them ?
4:14:012:0	I will smite them with the pestilence , and disinherit them , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they .
4:14:013:0	And Moses said unto the Lord , Then the Egyptians shall hear it , ( for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them ; )
4:14:014:0	And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land : for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people , that thou Lord art seen face to face , and that thy cloud standeth over them , and that thou goest before them , by day time in a pillar of a cloud , and in a pillar of fire by night .
4:14:015:0	Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
4:14:016:0	Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them , therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness .
4:14:017:0	And now , I beseech thee , let the power of my Lord be great , according as thou hast spoken , saying ,
4:14:018:0	The Lord is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
4:14:019:0	Pardon , I beseech thee , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy , and as thou hast forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now .
4:14:020:0	And the Lord said , I have pardoned according to thy word :
4:14:021:0	But as truly as I live , all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord .
4:14:022:0	Because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
4:14:023:0	Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
4:14:024:0	But my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and hath followed me fully , him will I bring into the land whereinto he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
4:14:025:0	( Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley . ) To morrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
4:14:026:0	And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
4:14:027:0	How long shall I bear with this evil congregation , which murmur against me ? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against me .
4:14:028:0	Say unto them , As truly as I live , saith the Lord , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will I do to you :
4:14:029:0	Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
4:14:030:0	Doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
4:14:031:0	But your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised .
4:14:032:0	But as for you , your carcases , they shall fall in this wilderness .
4:14:033:0	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness .
4:14:034:0	After the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
4:14:035:0	I the Lord have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
4:14:036:0	And the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
4:14:037:0	Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the Lord .
4:14:038:0	But Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
4:14:039:0	And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel : and the people mourned greatly .
4:14:040:0	And they rose up early in the morning , and gat them up into the top of the mountain , saying , Lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised : for we have sinned .
4:14:041:0	And Moses said , Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord ? but it shall not prosper .
4:14:042:0	Go not up , for the Lord is not among you ; that ye be not smitten before your enemies .
4:14:043:0	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you .
4:14:044:0	But they presumed to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and Moses , departed not out of the camp .
4:14:045:0	Then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
