4:24:001:0	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
4:24:002:0	And Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
4:24:003:0	And he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
4:24:004:0	He hath said , which heard the words of God , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
4:24:005:0	How goodly are thy tents , O Jacob , and thy tabernacles , O Israel !
4:24:006:0	As the valleys are they spread forth , as gardens by the river 's side , as the trees of lign aloes which the hath planted , and as cedar trees beside the waters .
4:24:007:0	He shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
4:24:008:0	God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn : he shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones , and pierce them through with his arrows .
4:24:009:0	He couched , he lay down as a lion , and as a great lion : who shall stir him up ? Blessed is he that blesseth thee , and cursed is he that curseth thee .
4:24:010:0	And Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
4:24:011:0	Therefore now flee thou to thy place : I thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the hath kept thee back from honour .
4:24:012:0	And Balaam said unto Balak , Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me , saying ,
4:24:013:0	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can not go beyond the commandment of the , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the saith , that will I speak ?
4:24:014:0	And now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
4:24:015:0	And he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
4:24:016:0	He hath said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
4:24:017:0	I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not nigh : there shall come a Star out of Jacob , and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel , and shall smite the corners of Moab , and destroy all the children of Sheth .
4:24:018:0	And Edom shall be a possession , Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies ; and Israel shall do valiantly .
4:24:019:0	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion , and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city .
4:24:020:0	And when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
4:24:021:0	And he looked on the Kenites , and took up his parable , and said , Strong is thy dwellingplace , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
4:24:022:0	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted , until Asshur shall carry thee away captive .
4:24:023:0	And he took up his parable , and said , Alas , who shall live when God doeth this !
4:24:024:0	And ships shall come from the coast of Kittim , and shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
4:24:025:0	And Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place : and Balak also went his way .
