4:22:001:0	And the children of Israel set forward , and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho .
4:22:002:0	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
4:22:003:0	And Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
4:22:004:0	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian , Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time .
4:22:005:0	He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor , which is by the river of the land of the children of his people , to call him , saying , Behold , there is a people come out from Egypt : behold , they cover the face of the earth , and they abide over against me :
4:22:006:0	Come now therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people ; for they are too mighty for me : peradventure I shall prevail , that we may smite them , and that I may drive them out of the land : for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed , and he whom thou cursest is cursed .
4:22:007:0	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
4:22:008:0	And he said unto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as the shall speak unto me : and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
4:22:009:0	And God came unto Balaam , and said , What men are these with thee ?
4:22:010:0	And Balaam said unto God , Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , hath sent unto me , saying ,
4:22:011:0	Behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
4:22:012:0	And God said unto Balaam , Thou shalt not go with them ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they are blessed .
4:22:013:0	And Balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
4:22:014:0	And the princes of Moab rose up , and they went unto Balak , and said , Balaam refuseth to come with us .
4:22:015:0	And Balak sent yet again princes , more , and more honourable than they .
4:22:016:0	And they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
4:22:017:0	For I will promote thee unto very great honour , and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me : come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
4:22:018:0	And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak , If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can not go beyond the word of the my God , to do less or more .
4:22:019:0	Now therefore , I pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that I may know what the will say unto me more .
4:22:020:0	And God came unto Balaam at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
4:22:021:0	And Balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his ass , and went with the princes of Moab .
4:22:022:0	And God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the stood in the way for an adversary against him . Now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
4:22:023:0	And the ass saw the angel of the standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
4:22:024:0	But the angel of the stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
4:22:025:0	And when the ass saw the angel of the , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
4:22:026:0	And the angel of the went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
4:22:027:0	And when the ass saw the angel of the , she fell down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
4:22:028:0	And the opened the mouth of the ass , and she said unto Balaam , What have I done unto thee , that thou hast smitten me these three times ?
4:22:029:0	And Balaam said unto the ass , Because thou hast mocked me : I would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would I kill thee .
4:22:030:0	And the ass said unto Balaam , Am not I thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day ? was I ever wont to do so unto thee ? And he said , Nay .
4:22:031:0	Then the opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
4:22:032:0	And the angel of the said unto him , Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times ? behold , I went out to withstand thee , because thy way is perverse before me :
4:22:033:0	And the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , surely now also I had slain thee , and saved her alive .
4:22:034:0	And Balaam said unto the angel of the , I have sinned ; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me : now therefore , if it displease thee , I will get me back again .
4:22:035:0	And the angel of the said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
4:22:036:0	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
4:22:037:0	And Balak said unto Balaam , Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not unto me ? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
4:22:038:0	And Balaam said unto Balak , Lo , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
4:22:039:0	And Balaam went with Balak , and they came unto Kirjathâ€“huzoth .
4:22:040:0	And Balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
4:22:041:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , that Balak took Balaam , and brought him up into the high places of Baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
