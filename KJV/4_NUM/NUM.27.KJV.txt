4:27:001:0	Then came the daughters of Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph : and these are the names of his daughters ; Mahlah , Noah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Tirzah .
4:27:002:0	And they stood before Moses , and before Eleazar the priest , and before the princes and all the congregation , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying ,
4:27:003:0	Our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
4:27:004:0	Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
4:27:005:0	And Moses brought their cause before the .
4:27:006:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:27:007:0	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
4:27:008:0	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
4:27:009:0	And if he have no daughter , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren .
4:27:010:0	And if he have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father 's brethren .
4:27:011:0	And if his father have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment , as the commanded Moses .
4:27:012:0	And the said unto Moses , Get thee up into this mount Abarim , and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel .
4:27:013:0	And when thou hast seen it , thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people , as Aaron thy brother was gathered .
4:27:014:0	For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin , in the strife of the congregation , to sanctify me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin .
4:27:015:0	And Moses spake unto the , saying ,
4:27:016:0	Let the , the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation ,
4:27:017:0	Which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the congregation of the be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
4:27:018:0	And the said unto Moses , Take thee Joshua the son of Nun , a man in whom is the spirit , and lay thine hand upon him ;
4:27:019:0	And set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the congregation ; and give him a charge in their sight .
4:27:020:0	And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient .
4:27:021:0	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the congregation .
4:27:022:0	And Moses did as the commanded him : and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the congregation :
4:27:023:0	And he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the commanded by the hand of Moses .
