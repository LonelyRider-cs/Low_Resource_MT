4:23:001:0	And Balaam said unto Balak , Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams .
4:23:002:0	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken ; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram .
4:23:003:0	And Balaam said unto Balak , Stand by thy burnt offering , and I will go : peradventure the will come to meet me : and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee . And he went to an high place .
4:23:004:0	And God met Balaam : and he said unto him , I have prepared seven altars , and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
4:23:005:0	And the put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , Return unto Balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
4:23:006:0	And he returned unto him , and , lo , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , he , and all the princes of Moab .
4:23:007:0	And he took up his parable , and said , Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , Come , curse me Jacob , and come , defy Israel .
4:23:008:0	How shall I curse , whom God hath not cursed ? or how shall I defy , whom the hath not defied ?
4:23:009:0	For from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
4:23:010:0	Who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? Let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
4:23:011:0	And Balak said unto Balaam , What hast thou done unto me ? I took thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast blessed them altogether .
4:23:012:0	And he answered and said , Must I not take heed to speak that which the hath put in my mouth ?
4:23:013:0	And Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
4:23:014:0	And he brought him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
4:23:015:0	And he said unto Balak , Stand here by thy burnt offering , while I meet the yonder .
4:23:016:0	And the met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and said , Go again unto Balak , and say thus .
4:23:017:0	And when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . And Balak said unto him , What hath the spoken ?
4:23:018:0	And he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor :
4:23:019:0	God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?
4:23:020:0	Behold , I have received commandment to bless : and he hath blessed ; and I can not reverse it .
4:23:021:0	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel : the his God is with him , and the shout of a king is among them .
4:23:022:0	God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn .
4:23:023:0	Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
4:23:024:0	Behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
4:23:025:0	And Balak said unto Balaam , Neither curse them at all , nor bless them at all .
4:23:026:0	But Balaam answered and said unto Balak , Told not I thee , saying , All that the speaketh , that I must do ?
4:23:027:0	And Balak said unto Balaam , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee unto another place ; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence .
4:23:028:0	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor , that looketh toward Jeshimon .
4:23:029:0	And Balaam said unto Balak , Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams .
4:23:030:0	And Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
