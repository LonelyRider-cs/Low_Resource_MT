4:20:001:0	Then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
4:20:002:0	And there was no water for the congregation : and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
4:20:003:0	And the people chode with Moses , and spake , saying , Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the !
4:20:004:0	And why have ye brought up the congregation of the into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
4:20:005:0	And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in unto this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink .
4:20:006:0	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the appeared unto them .
4:20:007:0	And the spake unto Moses , saying ,
4:20:008:0	Take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink .
4:20:009:0	And Moses took the rod from before the , as he commanded him .
4:20:010:0	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , Hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
4:20:011:0	And Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
4:20:012:0	And the spake unto Moses and Aaron , Because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them .
4:20:013:0	This is the water of Meribah ; because the children of Israel strove with the , and he was sanctified in them .
4:20:014:0	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom , Thus saith thy brother Israel , Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us :
4:20:015:0	How our fathers went down into Egypt , and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians vexed us , and our fathers :
4:20:016:0	And when we cried unto the , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of Egypt : and , behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border :
4:20:017:0	Let us pass , I pray thee , through thy country : we will not pass through the fields , or through the vineyards , neither will we drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king 's high way , we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have passed thy borders .
4:20:018:0	And Edom said unto him , Thou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
4:20:019:0	And the children of Israel said unto him , We will go by the high way : and if I and my cattle drink of thy water , then I will pay for it : I will only , without doing any thing else , go through on my feet .
4:20:020:0	And he said , Thou shalt not go through . And Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
4:20:021:0	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border : wherefore Israel turned away from him .
4:20:022:0	And the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , journeyed from Kadesh , and came unto mount Hor .
4:20:023:0	And the spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ,
4:20:024:0	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
4:20:025:0	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount Hor :
4:20:026:0	And strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
4:20:027:0	And Moses did as the commanded : and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
4:20:028:0	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount .
4:20:029:0	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mourned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
