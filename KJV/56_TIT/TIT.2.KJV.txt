56:2:001:0	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine :
56:2:002:0	That the aged men be sober , grave , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience .
56:2:003:0	The aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
56:2:004:0	That they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56:2:005:0	To be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of God be not blasphemed .
56:2:006:0	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded .
56:2:007:0	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine shewing uncorruptness , gravity , sincerity ,
56:2:008:0	Sound speech , that can not be condemned ; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say of you .
56:2:009:0	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ;
56:2:010:0	Not purloining , but shewing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things .
56:2:011:0	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men ,
56:2:012:0	Teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly , in this present world ;
56:2:013:0	Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
56:2:014:0	Who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
56:2:015:0	These things speak , and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . Let no man despise thee .
