56:1:001:0	Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of God's elect , and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness ;
56:1:002:0	In hope of eternal life , which God , that cannot lie , promised before the world began ;
56:1:003:0	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching , which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour ;
56:1:004:0	To Titus , mine own son after the common faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
56:1:005:0	For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
56:1:006:0	If any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly .
56:1:007:0	For a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of God ; not selfwilled , not soon angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ;
56:1:008:0	But a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ;
56:1:009:0	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
56:1:010:0	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers , specially they of the circumcision :
56:1:011:0	Whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre's sake .
56:1:012:0	One of themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , The Cretans are alway liars , evil beasts , slow bellies .
56:1:013:0	This witness is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
56:1:014:0	Not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
56:1:015:0	Unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
56:1:016:0	They profess that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
