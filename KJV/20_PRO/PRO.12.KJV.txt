20:12:004:0	A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband : but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones .
20:12:005:0	The thoughts of the righteous are right : but the counsels of the wicked are deceit .
20:12:006:0	The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood : but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them .
20:12:007:0	The wicked are overthrown , and are not : but the house of the righteous shall stand .
20:12:008:0	A man shall be commended according to his wisdom : but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised .
20:12:009:0	He that is despised , and hath a servant , is better than he that honoureth himself , and lacketh bread .
20:12:010:0	A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast : but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel .
20:12:011:0	He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding .
20:12:012:0	The wicked desireth the net of evil men : but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit .

20:12:014:0	A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth : and the recompence of a man 's hands shall be rendered unto him .
20:12:015:0	The way of a fool is right in his own eyes : but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise .
20:12:016:0	A fool 's wrath is presently known : but a prudent man covereth shame .

20:12:027:0	The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting : but the substance of a diligent man is precious .
20:12:028:0	In the way of righteousness is life ; and in the pathway thereof there is no death .
