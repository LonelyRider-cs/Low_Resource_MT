20:24:001:0	Be not thou envious against evil men , neither desire to be with them .
20:24:002:0	For their heart studieth destruction , and their lips talk of mischief .
20:24:003:0	Through wisdom is an house builded ; and by understanding it is established :
20:24:004:0	And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches .
20:24:005:0	A wise man is strong ; yea , a man of knowledge increaseth strength .
20:24:006:0	For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war : and in multitude of counsellors there is safety .
20:24:007:0	Wisdom is too high for a fool : he openeth not his mouth in the gate .
20:24:008:0	He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person .
20:24:009:0	The thought of foolishness is sin : and the scorner is an abomination to men .
20:24:010:0	If thou faint in the day of adversity , thy strength is small .
20:24:011:0	If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death , and those that are ready to be slain ;
20:24:012:0	If thou sayest , Behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
20:24:013:0	My son , eat thou honey , because it is good ; and the honeycomb , which is sweet to thy taste :
20:24:014:0	So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul : when thou hast found it , then there shall be a reward , and thy expectation shall not be cut off .
20:24:015:0	Lay not wait , O wicked man , against the dwelling of the righteous ; spoil not his resting place :
20:24:016:0	For a just man falleth seven times , and riseth up again : but the wicked shall fall into mischief .
20:24:017:0	Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth :
20:24:018:0	Lest the see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him .
20:24:019:0	Fret not thyself because of evil men , neither be thou envious at the wicked ;
20:24:020:0	For there shall be no reward to the evil man ; the candle of the wicked shall be put out .
20:24:021:0	My son , fear thou the and the king : and meddle not with them that are given to change :
20:24:022:0	For their calamity shall rise suddenly ; and who knoweth the ruin of them both ?
20:24:023:0	These things also belong to the wise . It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment .
20:24:024:0	He that saith unto the wicked , Thou art righteous ; him shall the people curse , nations shall abhor him :
20:24:025:0	But to them that rebuke him shall be delight , and a good blessing shall come upon them .
20:24:026:0	Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer .
20:24:027:0	Prepare thy work without , and make it fit for thyself in the field ; and afterwards build thine house .
20:24:028:0	Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause ; and deceive not with thy lips .
20:24:029:0	Say not , I will do so to him as he hath done to me : I will render to the man according to his work .
20:24:030:0	I went by the field of the slothful , and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding ;
20:24:031:0	And , lo , it was all grown over with thorns , and nettles had covered the face thereof , and the stone wall thereof was broken down .
20:24:032:0	Then I saw , and considered it well : I looked upon it , and received instruction .
20:24:033:0	Yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep :
20:24:034:0	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth ; and thy want as an armed man .
