20:2:001:0	My son , if thou wilt receive my words , and hide my commandments with thee ;
20:2:002:0	So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom , and apply thine heart to understanding ;
20:2:003:0	Yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up thy voice for understanding ;
20:2:004:0	If thou seekest her as silver , and searchest for her as for hid treasures ;
20:2:005:0	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord , and find the knowledge of God .
20:2:006:0	For the Lord giveth wisdom : out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding .
20:2:007:0	He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly .
20:2:008:0	He keepeth the paths of judgment , and preserveth the way of his saints .
20:2:009:0	Then shalt thou understand righteousness , and judgment , and equity ; yea , every good path .
20:2:010:0	When wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul ;
20:2:011:0	Discretion shall preserve thee , understanding shall keep thee :
20:2:012:0	To deliver thee from the way of the evil man , from the man that speaketh froward things ;
20:2:013:0	Who leave the paths of uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ;
20:2:014:0	Who rejoice to do evil , and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ;
20:2:015:0	Whose ways are crooked , and they froward in their paths :
20:2:016:0	To deliver thee from the strange woman , even from the stranger which flattereth with her words ;
20:2:017:0	Which forsaketh the guide of her youth , and forgetteth the covenant of her God .
20:2:018:0	For her house inclineth unto death , and her paths unto the dead .
20:2:019:0	None that go unto her return again , neither take they hold of the paths of life .
20:2:020:0	That thou mayest walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths of the righteous .
20:2:021:0	For the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall remain in it .
20:2:022:0	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it .
