20:17:001:0	Better is a dry morsel , and quietness therewith , than an house full of sacrifices with strife .
20:17:002:0	A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame , and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren .
20:17:003:0	The fining pot is for silver , and the furnace for gold : but the trieth the hearts .
20:17:004:0	A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips ; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue .
20:17:005:0	Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker : and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished .
20:17:006:0	Children 's children are the crown of old men ; and the glory of children are their fathers .
20:17:007:0	Excellent speech becometh not a fool : much less do lying lips a prince .
20:17:008:0	A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it : whithersoever it turneth , it prospereth .
20:17:009:0	He that covereth a transgression seeketh love ; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends .
20:17:010:0	A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool .
20:17:011:0	An evil man seeketh only rebellion : therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him .
20:17:012:0	Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man , rather than a fool in his folly .
20:17:013:0	Whoso rewardeth evil for good , evil shall not depart from his house .
20:17:014:0	The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water : therefore leave off contention , before it be meddled with .
20:17:015:0	He that justifieth the wicked , and he that condemneth the just , even they both are abomination to the .
20:17:016:0	Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom , seeing he hath no heart to it ?
20:17:017:0	A friend loveth at all times , and a brother is born for adversity .
20:17:018:0	A man void of understanding striketh hands , and becometh surety in the presence of his friend .
20:17:019:0	He loveth transgression that loveth strife : and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction .
20:17:020:0	He that hath a froward heart findeth no good : and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief .
20:17:021:0	He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow : and the father of a fool hath no joy .
20:17:022:0	A merry heart doeth good like a medicine : but a broken spirit drieth the bones .
20:17:023:0	A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment .
20:17:024:0	Wisdom is before him that hath understanding ; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth .
20:17:025:0	A foolish son is a grief to his father , and bitterness to her that bare him .
20:17:026:0	Also to punish the just is not good , nor to strike princes for equity .
20:17:027:0	He that hath knowledge spareth his words : and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit .
20:17:028:0	Even a fool , when he holdeth his peace , is counted wise : and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding .
