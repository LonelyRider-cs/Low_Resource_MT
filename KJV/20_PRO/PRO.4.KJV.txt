20:4:001:0	Hear , ye children , the instruction of a father , and attend to know understanding .
20:4:002:0	For I give you good doctrine , forsake ye not my law .
20:4:003:0	For I was my father 's son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
20:4:004:0	He taught me also , and said unto me , Let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments , and live .
20:4:005:0	Get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth .
20:4:006:0	Forsake her not , and she shall preserve thee : love her , and she shall keep thee .
20:4:007:0	Wisdom is the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with all thy getting get understanding .
20:4:008:0	Exalt her , and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honour , when thou dost embrace her .
20:4:009:0	She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee .
20:4:010:0	Hear , O my son , and receive my sayings ; and the years of thy life shall be many .
20:4:011:0	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; I have led thee in right paths .
20:4:012:0	When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
20:4:013:0	Take fast hold of instruction ; let her not go : keep her ; for she is thy life .
20:4:014:0	Enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men .
20:4:015:0	Avoid it , pass not by it , turn from it , and pass away .
20:4:016:0	For they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
20:4:017:0	For they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
20:4:018:0	But the path of the just is as the shining light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day .
20:4:019:0	The way of the wicked is as darkness : they know not at what they stumble .
20:4:020:0	My son , attend to my words ; incline thine ear unto my sayings .
20:4:021:0	Let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep them in the midst of thine heart .
20:4:022:0	For they are life unto those that find them , and health to all their flesh .
20:4:023:0	Keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of it are the issues of life .
20:4:024:0	Put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
20:4:025:0	Let thine eyes look right on , and let thine eyelids look straight before thee .
20:4:026:0	Ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy ways be established .
20:4:027:0	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left : remove thy foot from evil .
