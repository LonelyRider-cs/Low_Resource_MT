20:8:001:0	Doth not wisdom cry ? and understanding put forth her voice ?
20:8:002:0	She standeth in the top of high places , by the way in the places of the paths .
20:8:003:0	She crieth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
20:8:004:0	Unto you , O men , I call ; and my voice is to the sons of man .
20:8:005:0	O ye simple , understand wisdom : and , ye fools , be ye of an understanding heart .
20:8:006:0	Hear ; for I will speak of excellent things ; and the opening of my lips shall be right things .
20:8:007:0	For my mouth shall speak truth ; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips .
20:8:008:0	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness ; there is nothing froward or perverse in them .
20:8:009:0	They are all plain to him that understandeth , and right to them that find knowledge .
20:8:010:0	Receive my instruction , and not silver ; and knowledge rather than choice gold .
20:8:011:0	For wisdom is better than rubies ; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it .
20:8:012:0	I wisdom dwell with prudence , and find out knowledge of witty inventions .
20:8:013:0	The fear of the is to hate evil : pride , and arrogancy , and the evil way , and the froward mouth , do I hate .
20:8:014:0	Counsel is mine , and sound wisdom : I am understanding ; I have strength .
20:8:015:0	By me kings reign , and princes decree justice .
20:8:016:0	By me princes rule , and nobles , even all the judges of the earth .
20:8:017:0	I love them that love me ; and those that seek me early shall find me .
20:8:018:0	Riches and honour are with me ; yea , durable riches and righteousness .
20:8:019:0	My fruit is better than gold , yea , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
20:8:020:0	I lead in the way of righteousness , in the midst of the paths of judgment :
20:8:021:0	That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance ; and I will fill their treasures .
20:8:022:0	The possessed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
20:8:023:0	I was set up from everlasting , from the beginning , or ever the earth was .
20:8:024:0	When there were no depths , I was brought forth ; when there were no fountains abounding with water .
20:8:025:0	Before the mountains were settled , before the hills was I brought forth :
20:8:026:0	While as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the highest part of the dust of the world .
20:8:027:0	When he prepared the heavens , I was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the depth :
20:8:028:0	When he established the clouds above : when he strengthened the fountains of the deep :
20:8:029:0	When he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his commandment : when he appointed the foundations of the earth :
20:8:030:0	Then I was by him , as one brought up with him : and I was daily his delight , rejoicing always before him ;
20:8:031:0	Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth ; and my delights were with the sons of men .
20:8:032:0	Now therefore hearken unto me , O ye children : for blessed are they that keep my ways .
20:8:033:0	Hear instruction , and be wise , and refuse it not .
20:8:034:0	Blessed is the man that heareth me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
20:8:035:0	For whoso findeth me findeth life , and shall obtain favour of the .
20:8:036:0	But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul : all they that hate me love death .
