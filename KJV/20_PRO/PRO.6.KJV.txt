20:6:001:0	My son , if thou be surety for thy friend , if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger ,
20:6:002:0	Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth , thou art taken with the words of thy mouth .
20:6:003:0	Do this now , my son , and deliver thyself , when thou art come into the hand of thy friend ; go , humble thyself , and make sure thy friend .
20:6:004:0	Give not sleep to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids .
20:6:005:0	Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
20:6:006:0	Go to the ant , thou sluggard ; consider her ways , and be wise :
20:6:007:0	Which having no guide , overseer , or ruler ,
20:6:008:0	Provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest .
20:6:009:0	How long wilt thou sleep , O sluggard ? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep ?
20:6:010:0	Yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep :
20:6:011:0	So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth , and thy want as an armed man .
20:6:012:0	A naughty person , a wicked man , walketh with a froward mouth .
20:6:013:0	He winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ;
20:6:014:0	Frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
20:6:015:0	Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy .
20:6:016:0	These six things doth the Lord hate : yea , seven are an abomination unto him :
20:6:017:0	A proud look , a lying tongue , and hands that shed innocent blood ,
20:6:018:0	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief ,
20:6:019:0	A false witness that speaketh lies , and he that soweth discord among brethren .
20:6:020:0	My son , keep thy father's commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother :
20:6:021:0	Bind them continually upon thine heart , and tie them about thy neck .
20:6:022:0	When thou goest , it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keep thee ; and when thou awakest , it shall talk with thee .
20:6:023:0	For the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life :
20:6:024:0	To keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
20:6:025:0	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart ; neither let her take thee with her eyelids .
20:6:026:0	For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread : and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life .
20:6:027:0	Can a man take fire in his bosom , and his clothes not be burned ?
20:6:028:0	Can one go upon hot coals , and his feet not be burned ?
20:6:029:0	So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife ; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent .
20:6:030:0	Men do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ;
20:6:031:0	But if he be found , he shall restore sevenfold ; he shall give all the substance of his house .
20:6:032:0	But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding : he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul .
20:6:033:0	A wound and dishonour shall he get ; and his reproach shall not be wiped away .
20:6:034:0	For jealousy is the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
20:6:035:0	He will not regard any ransom ; neither will he rest content , though thou givest many gifts .
