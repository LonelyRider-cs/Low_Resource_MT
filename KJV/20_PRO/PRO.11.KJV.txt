20:11:001:0	A false balance is abomination to the Lord : but a just weight is his delight .
20:11:002:0	When pride cometh , then cometh shame : but with the lowly is wisdom .
20:11:003:0	The integrity of the upright shall guide them : but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them .
20:11:004:0	Riches profit not in the day of wrath : but righteousness delivereth from death .
20:11:005:0	The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way : but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness .
20:11:006:0	The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them : but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness .
20:11:007:0	When a wicked man dieth , his expectation shall perish : and the hope of unjust men perisheth .
20:11:008:0	The righteous is delivered out of trouble , and the wicked cometh in his stead .
20:11:009:0	An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour : but through knowledge shall the just be delivered .
20:11:010:0	When it goeth well with the righteous , the city rejoiceth : and when the wicked perish , there is shouting .
20:11:011:0	By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted : but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked .
20:11:012:0	He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour : but a man of understanding holdeth his peace .
20:11:013:0	A talebearer revealeth secrets : but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter .
20:11:014:0	Where no counsel is , the people fall : but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety .
20:11:015:0	He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it : and he that hateth suretiship is sure .
20:11:016:0	A gracious woman retaineth honour : and strong men retain riches .
20:11:017:0	The merciful man doeth good to his own soul : but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh .
20:11:018:0	The wicked worketh a deceitful work : but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward .
20:11:019:0	As righteousness tendeth to life : so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death .
20:11:020:0	They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord : but such as are upright in their way are his delight .
20:11:021:0	Though hand join in hand , the wicked shall not be unpunished : but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered .
20:11:022:0	As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout , so is a fair woman which is without discretion .
20:11:023:0	The desire of the righteous is only good : but the expectation of the wicked is wrath .
20:11:024:0	There is that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet , but it tendeth to poverty .
20:11:025:0	The liberal soul shall be made fat : and he that watereth shall be watered also himself .
20:11:026:0	He that withholdeth corn , the people shall curse him : but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it .
20:11:027:0	He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour : but he that seeketh mischief , it shall come unto him .
20:11:028:0	He that trusteth in his riches shall fall : but the righteous shall flourish as a branch .
20:11:029:0	He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind : and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart .
20:11:030:0	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life ; and he that winneth souls is wise .
20:11:031:0	Behold , the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth : much more the wicked and the sinner .
