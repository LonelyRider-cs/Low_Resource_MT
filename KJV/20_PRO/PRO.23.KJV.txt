20:23:001:0	When thou sittest to eat with a ruler , consider diligently what is before thee :
20:23:002:0	And put a knife to thy throat , if thou be a man given to appetite .
20:23:003:0	Be not desirous of his dainties : for they are deceitful meat .
20:23:004:0	Labour not to be rich : cease from thine own wisdom .
20:23:005:0	Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not ? for riches certainly make themselves wings ; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven .
20:23:006:0	Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye , neither desire thou his dainty meats :
20:23:007:0	For as he thinketh in his heart , so is he : Eat and drink , saith he to thee ; but his heart is not with thee .
20:23:008:0	The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up , and lose thy sweet words .
20:23:009:0	Speak not in the ears of a fool : for he will despise the wisdom of thy words .
20:23:010:0	Remove not the old landmark ; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless :
20:23:011:0	For their redeemer is mighty ; he shall plead their cause with thee .
20:23:012:0	Apply thine heart unto instruction , and thine ears to the words of knowledge .
20:23:013:0	Withhold not correction from the child : for if thou beatest him with the rod , he shall not die .
20:23:014:0	Thou shalt beat him with the rod , and shalt deliver his soul from hell .
20:23:015:0	My son , if thine heart be wise , my heart shall rejoice , even mine .
20:23:016:0	Yea , my reins shall rejoice , when thy lips speak right things .
20:23:017:0	Let not thine heart envy sinners : but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long .
20:23:018:0	For surely there is an end ; and thine expectation shall not be cut off .
20:23:019:0	Hear thou , my son , and be wise , and guide thine heart in the way .
20:23:020:0	Be not among winebibbers ; among riotous eaters of flesh :
20:23:021:0	For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty : and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags .
20:23:022:0	Hearken unto thy father that begat thee , and despise not thy mother when she is old .
20:23:023:0	Buy the truth , and sell it not ; also wisdom , and instruction , and understanding .
20:23:024:0	The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice : and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him .
20:23:025:0	Thy father and thy mother shall be glad , and she that bare thee shall rejoice .
20:23:026:0	My son , give me thine heart , and let thine eyes observe my ways .
20:23:027:0	For a whore is a deep ditch ; and a strange woman is a narrow pit .
20:23:028:0	She also lieth in wait as for a prey , and increaseth the transgressors among men .
20:23:029:0	Who hath woe ? who hath sorrow ? who hath contentions ? who hath babbling ? who hath wounds without cause ? who hath redness of eyes ?
20:23:030:0	They that tarry long at the wine ; they that go to seek mixed wine .
20:23:031:0	Look not thou upon the wine when it is red , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright .
20:23:032:0	At the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder .
20:23:033:0	Thine eyes shall behold strange women , and thine heart shall utter perverse things .
20:23:034:0	Yea , thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea , or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast .
20:23:035:0	They have stricken me , shalt thou say , and I was not sick ; they have beaten me , and I felt it not : when shall I awake ? I will seek it yet again .
