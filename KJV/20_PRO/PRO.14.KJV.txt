20:14:001:0	Every wise woman buildeth her house : but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands .
20:14:002:0	He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord : but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him .
20:14:003:0	In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride : but the lips of the wise shall preserve them .
20:14:004:0	Where no oxen are , the crib is clean : but much increase is by the strength of the ox .
20:14:005:0	A faithful witness will not lie : but a false witness will utter lies .
20:14:006:0	A scorner seeketh wisdom , and findeth it not : but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth .
20:14:007:0	Go from the presence of a foolish man , when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge .
20:14:008:0	The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way : but the folly of fools is deceit .
20:14:009:0	Fools make a mock at sin : but among the righteous there is favour .
20:14:010:0	The heart knoweth his own bitterness ; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy .
20:14:011:0	The house of the wicked shall be overthrown : but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish .
20:14:012:0	There is a way which seemeth right unto a man , but the end thereof are the ways of death .
20:14:013:0	Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful ; and the end of that mirth is heaviness .
20:14:014:0	The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
20:14:015:0	The simple believeth every word : but the prudent man looketh well to his going .
20:14:016:0	A wise man feareth , and departeth from evil : but the fool rageth , and is confident .
20:14:017:0	He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly : and a man of wicked devices is hated .
20:14:018:0	The simple inherit folly : but the prudent are crowned with knowledge .
20:14:019:0	The evil bow before the good ; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous .
20:14:020:0	The poor is hated even of his own neighbour : but the rich hath many friends .
20:14:021:0	He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth : but he that hath mercy on the poor , happy is he .
20:14:022:0	Do they not err that devise evil ? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good .
20:14:023:0	In all labour there is profit : but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury .
20:14:024:0	The crown of the wise is their riches : but the foolishness of fools is folly .
20:14:025:0	A true witness delivereth souls : but a deceitful witness speaketh lies .
20:14:026:0	In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence : and his children shall have a place of refuge .
20:14:027:0	The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life , to depart from the snares of death .
20:14:028:0	In the multitude of people is the king's honour : but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince .
20:14:029:0	He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding : but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly .
20:14:030:0	A sound heart is the life of the flesh : but envy the rottenness of the bones .
20:14:031:0	He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker : but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor .
20:14:032:0	The wicked is driven away in his wickedness : but the righteous hath hope in his death .
20:14:033:0	Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding : but that which is in the midst of fools is made known .
20:14:034:0	Righteousness exalteth a nation : but sin is a reproach to any people .
20:14:035:0	The king's favour is toward a wise servant : but his wrath is against him that causeth shame .
