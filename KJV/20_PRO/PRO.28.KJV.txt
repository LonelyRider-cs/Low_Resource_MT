20:28:001:0	The wicked flee when no man pursueth : but the righteous are bold as a lion .
20:28:002:0	For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged .
20:28:003:0	A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food .
20:28:004:0	They that forsake the law praise the wicked : but such as keep the law contend with them .
20:28:005:0	Evil men understand not judgment : but they that seek the Lord understand all things .
20:28:006:0	Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
20:28:007:0	Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son : but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father .
20:28:008:0	He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance , he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor .
20:28:009:0	He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer shall be abomination .
20:28:010:0	Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way , he shall fall himself into his own pit : but the upright shall have good things in possession .
20:28:011:0	The rich man is wise in his own conceit ; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out .
20:28:012:0	When righteous men do rejoice , there is great glory : but when the wicked rise , a man is hidden .
20:28:013:0	He that covereth his sins shall not prosper : but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy .
20:28:014:0	Happy is the man that feareth alway : but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief .
20:28:015:0	As a roaring lion , and a ranging bear ; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people .
20:28:016:0	The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor : but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days .
20:28:017:0	A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit ; let no man stay him .
20:28:018:0	Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved : but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once .
20:28:019:0	He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough .
20:28:020:0	A faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent .
20:28:021:0	To have respect of persons is not good : for for a piece of bread that man will transgress .
20:28:022:0	He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him .
20:28:023:0	He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue .
20:28:024:0	Whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer .
20:28:025:0	He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife : but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat .
20:28:026:0	He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool : but whoso walketh wisely , he shall be delivered .
20:28:027:0	He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse .
20:28:028:0	When the wicked rise , men hide themselves : but when they perish , the righteous increase .
