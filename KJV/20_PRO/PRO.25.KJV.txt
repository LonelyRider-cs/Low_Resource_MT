20:25:001:0	These are also proverbs of Solomon , which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out .
20:25:002:0	It is the glory of God to conceal a thing : but the honour of kings is to search out a matter .
20:25:003:0	The heaven for height , and the earth for depth , and the heart of kings is unsearchable .
20:25:004:0	Take away the dross from the silver , and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer .
20:25:005:0	Take away the wicked from before the king , and his throne shall be established in righteousness .
20:25:006:0	Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king , and stand not in the place of great men :
20:25:007:0	For better it is that it be said unto thee , Come up hither ; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen .
20:25:008:0	Go not forth hastily to strive , lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof , when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame .
20:25:009:0	Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
20:25:010:0	Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame , and thine infamy turn not away .
20:25:011:0	A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver .
20:25:012:0	As an earring of gold , and an ornament of fine gold , so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear .
20:25:013:0	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to them that send him : for he refresheth the soul of his masters .
20:25:014:0	Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain .
20:25:015:0	By long forbearing is a prince persuaded , and a soft tongue breaketh the bone .
20:25:016:0	Hast thou found honey ? eat so much as is sufficient for thee , lest thou be filled therewith , and vomit it .
20:25:017:0	Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour 's house ; lest he be weary of thee , and so hate thee .
20:25:018:0	A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul , and a sword , and a sharp arrow .
20:25:019:0	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth , and a foot out of joint .
20:25:020:0	As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather , and as vinegar upon nitre , so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart .
20:25:021:0	If thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink :
20:25:022:0	For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head , and the shall reward thee .
20:25:023:0	The north wind driveth away rain : so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue .
20:25:024:0	It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman and in a wide house .
20:25:025:0	As cold waters to a thirsty soul , so is good news from a far country .
20:25:026:0	A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain , and a corrupt spring .
20:25:027:0	It is not good to eat much honey : so for men to search their own glory is not glory .
20:25:028:0	He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
