20:9:001:0	Wisdom hath builded her house , she hath hewn out her seven pillars :
20:9:002:0	She hath killed her beasts ; she hath mingled her wine ; she hath also furnished her table .
20:9:003:0	She hath sent forth her maidens : she crieth upon the highest places of the city ,
20:9:004:0	Whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him ,
20:9:005:0	Come , eat of my bread , and drink of the wine which I have mingled .
20:9:006:0	Forsake the foolish , and live ; and go in the way of understanding .
20:9:007:0	He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame : and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot .
20:9:008:0	Reprove not a scorner , lest he hate thee : rebuke a wise man , and he will love thee .
20:9:009:0	Give instruction to a wise man , and he will be yet wiser : teach a just man , and he will increase in learning .
20:9:010:0	The fear of the is the beginning of wisdom : and the knowledge of the holy is understanding .
20:9:011:0	For by me thy days shall be multiplied , and the years of thy life shall be increased .
20:9:012:0	If thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thyself : but if thou scornest , thou alone shalt bear it .
20:9:013:0	A foolish woman is clamorous : she is simple , and knoweth nothing .
20:9:014:0	For she sitteth at the door of her house , on a seat in the high places of the city ,
20:9:015:0	To call passengers who go right on their ways :
20:9:016:0	Whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : and as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him ,
20:9:017:0	Stolen waters are sweet , and bread eaten in secret is pleasant .
20:9:018:0	But he knoweth not that the dead are there ; and that her guests are in the depths of hell .
