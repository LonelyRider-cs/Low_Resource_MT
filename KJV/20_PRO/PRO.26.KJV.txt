20:26:001:0	As snow in summer , and as rain in harvest , so honour is not seemly for a fool .
20:26:002:0	As the bird by wandering , as the swallow by flying , so the curse causeless shall not come .
20:26:003:0	A whip for the horse , a bridle for the ass , and a rod for the fool's back .
20:26:004:0	Answer not a fool according to his folly , lest thou also be like unto him .
20:26:005:0	Answer a fool according to his folly , lest he be wise in his own conceit .
20:26:006:0	He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet , and drinketh damage .
20:26:007:0	The legs of the lame are not equal : so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
20:26:008:0	As he that bindeth a stone in a sling , so is he that giveth honour to a fool .
20:26:009:0	As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard , so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
20:26:010:0	The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool , and rewardeth transgressors .
20:26:011:0	As a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly .
20:26:012:0	Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit ? there is more hope of a fool than of him .
20:26:013:0	The slothful man saith , There is a lion in the way ; a lion is in the streets .
20:26:014:0	As the door turneth upon his hinges , so doth the slothful upon his bed .
20:26:015:0	The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom ; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth .
20:26:016:0	The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason .
20:26:017:0	He that passeth by , and meddleth with strife belonging not to him , is like one that taketh a dog by the ears .
20:26:018:0	As a mad man who casteth firebrands , arrows , and death ,
20:26:019:0	So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour , and saith , Am not I in sport ?
20:26:020:0	Where no wood is , there the fire goeth out : so where there is no talebearer , the strife ceaseth .
20:26:021:0	As coals are to burning coals , and wood to fire ; so is a contentious man to kindle strife .
20:26:022:0	The words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly .
20:26:023:0	Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross .
20:26:024:0	He that hateth dissembleth with his lips , and layeth up deceit within him ;
20:26:025:0	When he speaketh fair , believe him not : for there are seven abominations in his heart .
20:26:026:0	Whose hatred is covered by deceit , his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation .
20:26:027:0	Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein : and he that rolleth a stone , it will return upon him .
20:26:028:0	A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it ; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin .
