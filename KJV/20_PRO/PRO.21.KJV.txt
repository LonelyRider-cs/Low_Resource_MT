20:21:001:0	The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord , as the rivers of water : he turneth it whithersoever he will .
20:21:002:0	Every way of a man is right in his own eyes : but the Lord pondereth the hearts .
20:21:003:0	To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice .
20:21:004:0	An high look , and a proud heart , and the plowing of the wicked , is sin .
20:21:005:0	The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness ; but of every one that is hasty only to want .
20:21:006:0	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death .
20:21:007:0	The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them ; because they refuse to do judgment .
20:21:008:0	The way of man is froward and strange : but as for the pure , his work is right .
20:21:009:0	It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman in a wide house .
20:21:010:0	The soul of the wicked desireth evil : his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes .
20:21:011:0	When the scorner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when the wise is instructed , he receiveth knowledge .
20:21:012:0	The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked : but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness .
20:21:013:0	Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
20:21:014:0	A gift in secret pacifieth anger : and a reward in the bosom strong wrath .
20:21:015:0	It is joy to the just to do judgment : but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity .
20:21:016:0	The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead .
20:21:017:0	He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man : he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich .
20:21:018:0	The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous , and the transgressor for the upright .
20:21:019:0	It is better to dwell in the wilderness , than with a contentious and an angry woman .
20:21:020:0	There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise ; but a foolish man spendeth it up .
20:21:021:0	He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life , righteousness , and honour .
20:21:022:0	A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty , and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof .
20:21:023:0	Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles .
20:21:024:0	Proud and haughty scorner is his name , who dealeth in proud wrath .
20:21:025:0	The desire of the slothful killeth him ; for his hands refuse to labour .
20:21:026:0	He coveteth greedily all the day long : but the righteous giveth and spareth not .
20:21:027:0	The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination : how much more , when he bringeth it with a wicked mind ?
20:21:028:0	A false witness shall perish : but the man that heareth speaketh constantly .
20:21:029:0	A wicked man hardeneth his face : but as for the upright , he directeth his way .
20:21:030:0	There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord .
20:21:031:0	The horse is prepared against the day of battle : but safety is of the Lord .
