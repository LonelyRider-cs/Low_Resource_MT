20:3:001:0	My son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandments :
20:3:002:0	For length of days , and long life , and peace , shall they add to thee .
20:3:003:0	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee : bind them about thy neck ; write them upon the table of thine heart :
20:3:004:0	So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
20:3:005:0	Trust in the with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .
20:3:006:0	In all thy ways acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy paths .
20:3:007:0	Be not wise in thine own eyes : fear the , and depart from evil .
20:3:008:0	It shall be health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bones .
20:3:009:0	Honour the with thy substance , and with the firstfruits of all thine increase :
20:3:010:0	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty , and thy presses shall burst out with new wine .
20:3:011:0	My son , despise not the chastening of the ; neither be weary of his correction :
20:3:012:0	For whom the loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
20:3:013:0	Happy is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding .
20:3:014:0	For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold .
20:3:015:0	She is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her .
20:3:016:0	Length of days is in her right hand ; and in her left hand riches and honour .
20:3:017:0	Her ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace .
20:3:018:0	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that retaineth her .
20:3:019:0	The by wisdom hath founded the earth ; by understanding hath he established the heavens .
20:3:020:0	By his knowledge the depths are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew .
20:3:021:0	My son , let not them depart from thine eyes : keep sound wisdom and discretion :
20:3:022:0	So shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck .
20:3:023:0	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely , and thy foot shall not stumble .
20:3:024:0	When thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet .
20:3:025:0	Be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh .
20:3:026:0	For the shall be thy confidence , and shall keep thy foot from being taken .
20:3:027:0	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thine hand to do it .
20:3:028:0	Say not unto thy neighbour , Go , and come again , and to morrow I will give ; when thou hast it by thee .
20:3:029:0	Devise not evil against thy neighbour , seeing he dwelleth securely by thee .
20:3:030:0	Strive not with a man without cause , if he have done thee no harm .
20:3:031:0	Envy thou not the oppressor , and choose none of his ways .
20:3:032:0	For the froward is abomination to the : but his secret is with the righteous .
20:3:033:0	The curse of the is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the just .
20:3:034:0	Surely he scorneth the scorners : but he giveth grace unto the lowly .
20:3:035:0	The wise shall inherit glory : but shame shall be the promotion of fools .
