20:27:001:0	Boast not thyself of to morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth .
20:27:002:0	Let another man praise thee , and not thine own mouth ; a stranger , and not thine own lips .
20:27:003:0	A stone is heavy , and the sand weighty ; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both .
20:27:004:0	Wrath is cruel , and anger is outrageous ; but who is able to stand before envy ?
20:27:005:0	Open rebuke is better than secret love .
20:27:006:0	Faithful are the wounds of a friend ; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful .
20:27:007:0	The full soul loatheth an honeycomb ; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet .
20:27:008:0	As a bird that wandereth from her nest , so is a man that wandereth from his place .
20:27:009:0	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart : so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel .
20:27:010:0	Thine own friend , and thy father's friend , forsake not ; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
20:27:011:0	My son , be wise , and make my heart glad , that I may answer him that reproacheth me .
20:27:012:0	A prudent man foreseeth the evil , and hideth himself ; but the simple pass on , and are punished .
20:27:013:0	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger , and take a pledge of him for a strange woman .
20:27:014:0	He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a curse to him .
20:27:015:0	A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike .
20:27:016:0	Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind , and the ointment of his right hand , which bewrayeth itself .
20:27:017:0	Iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend .
20:27:018:0	Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof : so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured .
20:27:019:0	As in water face answereth to face , so the heart of man to man .
20:27:020:0	Hell and destruction are never full ; so the eyes of man are never satisfied .
20:27:021:0	As the fining pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so is a man to his praise .
20:27:022:0	Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him .
20:27:023:0	Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks , and look well to thy herds .
20:27:024:0	For riches are not for ever : and doth the crown endure to every generation ?
20:27:025:0	The hay appeareth , and the tender grass sheweth itself , and herbs of the mountains are gathered .
20:27:026:0	The lambs are for thy clothing , and the goats are the price of the field .
20:27:027:0	And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food , for the food of thy household , and for the maintenance for thy maidens .
