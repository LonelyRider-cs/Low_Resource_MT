20:31:001:0	The words of king Lemuel , the prophecy that his mother taught him .
20:31:002:0	What , my son ? and what , the son of my womb ? and what , the son of my vows ?
20:31:003:0	Give not thy strength unto women , nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings .
20:31:004:0	It is not for kings , O Lemuel , it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes strong drink :
20:31:005:0	Lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted .
20:31:006:0	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish , and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts .
20:31:007:0	Let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more .
20:31:008:0	Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction .
20:31:009:0	Open thy mouth , judge righteously , and plead the cause of the poor and needy .
20:31:010:0	Who can find a virtuous woman ? for her price is far above rubies .
20:31:011:0	The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
20:31:012:0	She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life .
20:31:013:0	She seeketh wool , and flax , and worketh willingly with her hands .
20:31:014:0	She is like the merchants ' ships ; she bringeth her food from afar .
20:31:015:0	She riseth also while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and a portion to her maidens .
20:31:016:0	She considereth a field , and buyeth it : with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .
20:31:017:0	She girdeth her loins with strength , and strengtheneth her arms .
20:31:018:0	She perceiveth that her merchandise is good : her candle goeth not out by night .
20:31:019:0	She layeth her hands to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff .
20:31:020:0	She stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
20:31:021:0	She is not afraid of the snow for her household : for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
20:31:022:0	She maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple .
20:31:023:0	Her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
20:31:024:0	She maketh fine linen , and selleth it ; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
20:31:025:0	Strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come .
20:31:026:0	She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness .
20:31:027:0	She looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
20:31:028:0	Her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
20:31:029:0	Many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all .
20:31:030:0	Favour is deceitful , and beauty is vain : but a woman that feareth the , she shall be praised .
20:31:031:0	Give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
