20:5:001:0	My son , attend unto my wisdom , and bow thine ear to my understanding :
20:5:002:0	That thou mayest regard discretion , and that thy lips may keep knowledge .
20:5:003:0	For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb , and her mouth is smoother than oil :
20:5:004:0	But her end is bitter as wormwood , sharp as a twoedged sword .
20:5:005:0	Her feet go down to death ; her steps take hold on hell .
20:5:006:0	Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her ways are moveable , that thou canst not know them .
20:5:007:0	Hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
20:5:008:0	Remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house :
20:5:009:0	Lest thou give thine honour unto others , and thy years unto the cruel :
20:5:010:0	Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth ; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger ;
20:5:011:0	And thou mourn at the last , when thy flesh and thy body are consumed ,
20:5:012:0	And say , How have I hated instruction , and my heart despised reproof ;
20:5:013:0	And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
20:5:014:0	I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly .
20:5:015:0	Drink waters out of thine own cistern , and running waters out of thine own well .
20:5:016:0	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad , and rivers of waters in the streets .
20:5:017:0	Let them be only thine own , and not strangers ' with thee .
20:5:018:0	Let thy fountain be blessed : and rejoice with the wife of thy youth .
20:5:019:0	Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ravished always with her love .
20:5:020:0	And why wilt thou , my son , be ravished with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
20:5:021:0	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the , and he pondereth all his goings .
20:5:022:0	His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins .
20:5:023:0	He shall die without instruction ; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray .
