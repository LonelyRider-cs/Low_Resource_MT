20:16:010:0	A divine sentence is in the lips of the king : his mouth transgresseth not in judgment .

20:16:015:0	In the light of the king 's countenance is life ; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain .
20:16:016:0	How much better is it to get wisdom than gold ! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver !
20:16:017:0	The highway of the upright is to depart from evil : he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul .
20:16:018:0	Pride goeth before destruction , and an haughty spirit before a fall .

20:16:032:0	He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city .
20:16:033:0	The lot is cast into the lap ; but the whole disposing thereof is of the .
