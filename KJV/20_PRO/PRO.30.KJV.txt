20:30:001:0	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh , even the prophecy : the man spake unto Ithiel , even unto Ithiel and Ucal ,
20:30:002:0	Surely I am more brutish than any man , and have not the understanding of a man .
20:30:003:0	I neither learned wisdom , nor have the knowledge of the holy .
20:30:004:0	Who hath ascended up into heaven , or descended ? who hath gathered the wind in his fists ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? what is his name , and what is his son 's name , if thou canst tell ?
20:30:005:0	Every word of God is pure : he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him .
20:30:006:0	Add thou not unto his words , lest he reprove thee , and thou be found a liar .
20:30:007:0	Two things have I required of thee ; deny me them not before I die :
20:30:008:0	Remove far from me vanity and lies : give me neither poverty nor riches ; feed me with food convenient for me :
20:30:009:0	Lest I be full , and deny thee , and say , Who is the ? or lest I be poor , and steal , and take the name of my God in vain .
20:30:010:0	Accuse not a servant unto his master , lest he curse thee , and thou be found guilty .
20:30:011:0	There is a generation that curseth their father , and doth not bless their mother .
20:30:012:0	There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet is not washed from their filthiness .
20:30:013:0	There is a generation , O how lofty are their eyes ! and their eyelids are lifted up .
20:30:014:0	There is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
20:30:015:0	The horseleach hath two daughters , crying , Give , give . There are three things that are never satisfied , yea , four things say not , It is enough :
20:30:016:0	The grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , It is enough .
20:30:017:0	The eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young eagles shall eat it .
20:30:018:0	There be three things which are too wonderful for me , yea , four which I know not :
20:30:019:0	The way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
20:30:020:0	Such is the way of an adulterous woman ; she eateth , and wipeth her mouth , and saith , I have done no wickedness .
20:30:021:0	For three things the earth is disquieted , and for four which it can not bear :
20:30:022:0	For a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he is filled with meat ;
20:30:023:0	For an odious woman when she is married ; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress .
20:30:024:0	There be four things which are little upon the earth , but they are exceeding wise :
20:30:025:0	The ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ;
20:30:026:0	The conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks ;
20:30:027:0	The locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ;
20:30:028:0	The spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces .
20:30:029:0	There be three things which go well , yea , four are comely in going :
20:30:030:0	A lion which is strongest among beasts , and turneth not away for any ;
20:30:031:0	A greyhound ; an he goat also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising up .
20:30:032:0	If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself , or if thou hast thought evil , lay thine hand upon thy mouth .
20:30:033:0	Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter , and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood : so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife .
