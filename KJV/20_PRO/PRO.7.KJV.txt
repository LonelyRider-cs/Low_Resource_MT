20:7:001:0	My son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee .
20:7:002:0	Keep my commandments , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye .
20:7:003:0	Bind them upon thy fingers , write them upon the table of thine heart .
20:7:004:0	Say unto wisdom , Thou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kinswoman :
20:7:005:0	That they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with her words .
20:7:006:0	For at the window of my house I looked through my casement ,
20:7:007:0	And beheld among the simple ones , I discerned among the youths , a young man void of understanding ,
20:7:008:0	Passing through the street near her corner ; and he went the way to her house ,
20:7:009:0	In the twilight , in the evening , in the black and dark night :
20:7:010:0	And , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot , and subtil of heart .
20:7:011:0	( She is loud and stubborn ; her feet abide not in her house :
20:7:012:0	Now is she without , now in the streets , and lieth in wait at every corner . )
20:7:013:0	So she caught him , and kissed him , and with an impudent face said unto him ,
20:7:014:0	I have peace offerings with me ; this day have I payed my vows .
20:7:015:0	Therefore came I forth to meet thee , diligently to seek thy face , and I have found thee .
20:7:016:0	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry , with carved works , with fine linen of Egypt .
20:7:017:0	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloes , and cinnamon .
20:7:018:0	Come , let us take our fill of love until the morning : let us solace ourselves with loves .
20:7:019:0	For the goodman is not at home , he is gone a long journey :
20:7:020:0	He hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
20:7:021:0	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield , with the flattering of her lips she forced him .
20:7:022:0	He goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;
20:7:023:0	Till a dart strike through his liver ; as a bird hasteth to the snare , and knoweth not that it is for his life .
20:7:024:0	Hearken unto me now therefore , O ye children , and attend to the words of my mouth .
20:7:025:0	Let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths .
20:7:026:0	For she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
20:7:027:0	Her house is the way to hell , going down to the chambers of death .
