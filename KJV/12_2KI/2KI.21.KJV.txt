12:21:001:0	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem . And his mother 's name was Hephziâ€“bah .
12:21:002:0	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the cast out before the children of Israel .
12:21:003:0	For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made a grove , as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
12:21:004:0	And he built altars in the house of the , of which the said , In Jerusalem will I put my name .
12:21:005:0	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the .
12:21:006:0	And he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the , to provoke him to anger .
12:21:007:0	And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house , of which the said to David , and to Solomon his son , In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel , will I put my name for ever :
12:21:008:0	Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers ; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them , and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them .
12:21:009:0	But they hearkened not : and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the destroyed before the children of Israel .
12:21:010:0	And the spake by his servants the prophets , saying ,
12:21:011:0	Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did , which were before him , and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols :
12:21:012:0	Therefore thus saith the God of Israel , Behold , I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah , that whosoever heareth of it , both his ears shall tingle .
12:21:013:0	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria , and the plummet of the house of Ahab : and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wiping it , and turning it upside down .
12:21:014:0	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
12:21:015:0	Because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
12:21:016:0	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of the .
12:21:017:0	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
12:21:018:0	And Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
12:21:019:0	Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . And his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
12:21:020:0	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the , as his father Manasseh did .
12:21:021:0	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshipped them :
12:21:022:0	And he forsook the God of his fathers , and walked not in the way of the .
12:21:023:0	And the servants of Amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his own house .
12:21:024:0	And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
12:21:025:0	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
12:21:026:0	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza : and Josiah his son reigned in his stead .
