12:5:001:0	Now Naaman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria : he was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
12:5:002:0	And the Syrians had gone out by companies , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid ; and she waited on Naaman's wife .
12:5:003:0	And she said unto her mistress , Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria ! for he would recover him of his leprosy .
12:5:004:0	And one went in , and told his lord , saying , Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
12:5:005:0	And the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . And he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
12:5:006:0	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy .
12:5:007:0	And it came to pass , when the king of Israel had read the letter , that he rent his clothes , and said , Am I God , to kill and to make alive , that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy ? wherefore consider , I pray you , and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me .
12:5:008:0	And it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
12:5:009:0	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
12:5:010:0	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
12:5:011:0	But Naaman was wroth , and went away , and said , Behold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the Lord his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the leper .
12:5:012:0	Are not Abana and Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? may I not wash in them , and be clean ? So he turned and went away in a rage .
12:5:013:0	And his servants came near , and spake unto him , and said , My father , if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing , wouldest thou not have done it ? how much rather then , when he saith to thee , Wash , and be clean ?
12:5:014:0	Then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
12:5:015:0	And he returned to the man of God , he and all his company , and came , and stood before him : and he said , Behold , now I know that there is no God in all the earth , but in Israel : now therefore , I pray thee , take a blessing of thy servant .
12:5:016:0	But he said , As the Lord liveth , before whom I stand , I will receive none . And he urged him to take it ; but he refused .
12:5:017:0	And Naaman said , Shall there not then , I pray thee , be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth ? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods , but unto the Lord .
12:5:018:0	In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant , that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there , and he leaneth on my hand , and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon : when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon , the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing .
12:5:019:0	And he said unto him , Go in peace . So he departed from him a little way .
12:5:020:0	But Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said , Behold , my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian , in not receiving at his hands that which he brought : but , as the Lord liveth , I will run after him , and take somewhat of him .
12:5:021:0	So Gehazi followed after Naaman . And when Naaman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the chariot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
12:5:022:0	And he said , All is well . My master hath sent me , saying , Behold , even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets : give them , I pray thee , a talent of silver , and two changes of garments .
12:5:023:0	And Naaman said , Be content , take two talents . And he urged him , and bound two talents of silver in two bags , with two changes of garments , and laid them upon two of his servants ; and they bare them before him .
12:5:024:0	And when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
12:5:025:0	But he went in , and stood before his master . And Elisha said unto him , Whence comest thou , Gehazi ? And he said , Thy servant went no whither .
12:5:026:0	And he said unto him , Went not mine heart with thee , when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee ? Is it a time to receive money , and to receive garments , and oliveyards , and vineyards , and sheep , and oxen , and menservants , and maidservants ?
12:5:027:0	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever . And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow .
