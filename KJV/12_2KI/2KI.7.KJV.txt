12:7:001:0	Then Elisha said , Hear ye the word of the ; Thus saith the , To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the gate of Samaria .
12:7:002:0	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God , and said , Behold , if the would make windows in heaven , might this thing be ? And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
12:7:003:0	And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate : and they said one to another , Why sit we here until we die ?
12:7:004:0	If we say , We will enter into the city , then the famine is in the city , and we shall die there : and if we sit still here , we die also . Now therefore come , and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians : if they save us alive , we shall live ; and if they kill us , we shall but die .
12:7:005:0	And they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
12:7:006:0	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots , and a noise of horses , even the noise of a great host : and they said one to another , Lo , the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of the Egyptians , to come upon us .
12:7:007:0	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
12:7:008:0	And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp , they went into one tent , and did eat and drink , and carried thence silver , and gold , and raiment , and went and hid it ; and came again , and entered into another tent , and carried thence also , and went and hid it .
12:7:009:0	Then they said one to another , We do not well : this day is a day of good tidings , and we hold our peace : if we tarry till the morning light , some mischief will come upon us : now therefore come , that we may go and tell the king 's household .
12:7:010:0	So they came and called unto the porter of the city : and they told them , saying , We came to the camp of the Syrians , and , behold , there was no man there , neither voice of man , but horses tied , and asses tied , and the tents as they were .
12:7:011:0	And he called the porters ; and they told it to the king 's house within .
12:7:012:0	And the king arose in the night , and said unto his servants , I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us . They know that we be hungry ; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field , saying , When they come out of the city , we shall catch them alive , and get into the city .
12:7:013:0	And one of his servants answered and said , Let some take , I pray thee , five of the horses that remain , which are left in the city , ( behold , they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it : behold , I say , they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed : ) and let us send and see .
12:7:014:0	They took therefore two chariot horses ; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians , saying , Go and see .
12:7:015:0	And they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . And the messengers returned , and told the king .
12:7:016:0	And the people went out , and spoiled the tents of the Syrians . So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of the .
12:7:017:0	And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who spake when the king came down to him .
12:7:018:0	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king , saying , Two measures of barley for a shekel , and a measure of fine flour for a shekel , shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria :
12:7:019:0	And that lord answered the man of God , and said , Now , behold , if the should make windows in heaven , might such a thing be ? And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
12:7:020:0	And so it fell out unto him : for the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died .
