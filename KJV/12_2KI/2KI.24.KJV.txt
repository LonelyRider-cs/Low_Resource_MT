12:24:001:0	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up , and Jehoiakim became his servant three years : then he turned and rebelled against him .
12:24:002:0	And the sent against him bands of the Chaldeans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
12:24:003:0	Surely at the commandment of the came this upon Judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ;
12:24:004:0	And also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the would not pardon .
12:24:005:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
12:24:006:0	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
12:24:007:0	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
12:24:008:0	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem three months . And his mother 's name was Nehushta , the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
12:24:009:0	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the , according to all that his father had done .
12:24:010:0	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
12:24:011:0	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city , and his servants did besiege it .
12:24:012:0	And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
12:24:013:0	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the , as the had said .
12:24:014:0	And he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valour , even ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and smiths : none remained , save the poorest sort of the people of the land .
12:24:015:0	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
12:24:016:0	And all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
12:24:017:0	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father 's brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
12:24:018:0	Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . And his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
12:24:019:0	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
12:24:020:0	For through the anger of the it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
