12:22:001:0	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . And his mother's name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath .
12:22:002:0	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
12:22:003:0	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
12:22:004:0	Go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
12:22:005:0	And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work , that have the oversight of the house of the Lord : and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the Lord , to repair the breaches of the house ,
12:22:006:0	Unto carpenters , and builders , and masons , and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
12:22:007:0	Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt faithfully .
12:22:008:0	And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
12:22:009:0	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the Lord .
12:22:010:0	And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book . And Shaphan read it before the king .
12:22:011:0	And it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clothes .
12:22:012:0	And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king's , saying ,
12:22:013:0	Go ye , enquire of the Lord for me , and for the people , and for all Judah , concerning the words of this book that is found : for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us , because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book , to do according unto all that which is written concerning us .
12:22:014:0	So Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah , went unto Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ; ) and they communed with her .
12:22:015:0	And she said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Tell the man that sent you to me ,
12:22:016:0	Thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
12:22:017:0	Because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
12:22:018:0	But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , As touching the words which thou hast heard ;
12:22:019:0	Because thine heart was tender , and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord , when thou heardest what I spake against this place , and against the inhabitants thereof , that they should become a desolation and a curse , and hast rent thy clothes , and wept before me ; I also have heard thee , saith the Lord .
12:22:020:0	Behold therefore , I will gather thee unto thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place . And they brought the king word again .
