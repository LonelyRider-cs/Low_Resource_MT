12:10:001:0	And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . And Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , unto the rulers of Jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up Ahab 's children , saying ,
12:10:002:0	Now as soon as this letter cometh to you , seeing your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fenced city also , and armour ;
12:10:003:0	Look even out the best and meetest of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
12:10:004:0	But they were exceedingly afraid , and said , Behold , two kings stood not before him : how then shall we stand ?
12:10:005:0	And he that was over the house , and he that was over the city , the elders also , and the bringers up of the children , sent to Jehu , saying , We are thy servants , and will do all that thou shalt bid us ; we will not make any king : do thou that which is good in thine eyes .
12:10:006:0	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them , saying , If ye be mine , and if ye will hearken unto my voice , take ye the heads of the men your master 's sons , and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time . Now the king 's sons , being seventy persons , were with the great men of the city , which brought them up .
12:10:007:0	And it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
12:10:008:0	And there came a messenger , and told him , saying , They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . And he said , Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
12:10:009:0	And it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Ye be righteous : behold , I conspired against my master , and slew him : but who slew all these ?
12:10:010:0	Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the , which the spake concerning the house of Ahab : for the hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah .
12:10:011:0	So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , and all his great men , and his kinsfolks , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
12:10:012:0	And he arose and departed , and came to Samaria . And as he was at the shearing house in the way ,
12:10:013:0	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah , and said , Who are ye ? And they answered , We are the brethren of Ahaziah ; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen .
12:10:014:0	And he said , Take them alive . And they took them alive , and slew them at the pit of the shearing house , even two and forty men ; neither left he any of them .
12:10:015:0	And when he was departed thence , he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him : and he saluted him , and said to him , Is thine heart right , as my heart is with thy heart ? And Jehonadab answered , It is . If it be , give me thine hand . And he gave him his hand ; and he took him up to him into the chariot .
12:10:016:0	And he said , Come with me , and see my zeal for the . So they made him ride in his chariot .
12:10:017:0	And when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the , which he spake to Elijah .
12:10:018:0	And Jehu gathered all the people together , and said unto them , Ahab served Baal a little ; but Jehu shall serve him much .
12:10:019:0	Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal , all his servants , and all his priests ; let none be wanting : for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal ; whosoever shall be wanting , he shall not live . But Jehu did it in subtilty , to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal .
12:10:020:0	And Jehu said , Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal . And they proclaimed it .
12:10:021:0	And Jehu sent through all Israel : and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not . And they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
12:10:022:0	And he said unto him that was over the vestry , Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal . And he brought them forth vestments .
12:10:023:0	And Jehu went , and Jehonadab the son of Rechab , into the house of Baal , and said unto the worshippers of Baal , Search , and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the , but the worshippers of Baal only .
12:10:024:0	And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings , Jehu appointed fourscore men without , and said , If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape , he that letteth him go , his life shall be for the life of him .
12:10:025:0	And it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains , Go in , and slay them ; let none come forth . And they smote them with the edge of the sword ; and the guard and the captains cast them out , and went to the city of the house of Baal .
12:10:026:0	And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal , and burned them .
12:10:027:0	And they brake down the image of Baal , and brake down the house of Baal , and made it a draught house unto this day .
12:10:028:0	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel .
12:10:029:0	Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Beth–el , and that were in Dan .
12:10:030:0	And the said unto Jehu , Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes , and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart , thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel .
12:10:031:0	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , which made Israel to sin .
12:10:032:0	In those days the began to cut Israel short : and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel ;
12:10:033:0	From Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , even Gilead and Bashan .
12:10:034:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
12:10:035:0	And Jehu slept with his fathers : and they buried him in Samaria . And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead .
12:10:036:0	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years .
