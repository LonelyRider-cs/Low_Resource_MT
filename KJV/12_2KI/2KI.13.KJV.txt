12:13:001:0	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned seventeen years .
12:13:002:0	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
12:13:003:0	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben–hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
12:13:004:0	And Jehoahaz besought the Lord , and the Lord hearkened unto him : for he saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
12:13:005:0	( And the Lord gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
12:13:006:0	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel sin , but walked therein : and there remained the grove also in Samaria . )
12:13:007:0	Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
12:13:008:0	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
12:13:009:0	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria : and Joash his son reigned in his stead .
12:13:010:0	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned sixteen years .
12:13:011:0	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
12:13:012:0	And the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
12:13:013:0	And Joash slept with his fathers ; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne : and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
12:13:014:0	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died . And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof .
12:13:015:0	And Elisha said unto him , Take bow and arrows . And he took unto him bow and arrows .
12:13:016:0	And he said to the king of Israel , Put thine hand upon the bow . And he put his hand upon it : and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands .
12:13:017:0	And he said , Open the window eastward . And he opened it . Then Elisha said , Shoot . And he shot . And he said , The arrow of the Lord's deliverance , and the arrow of deliverance from Syria : for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek , till thou have consumed them .
12:13:018:0	And he said , Take the arrows . And he took them . And he said unto the king of Israel , Smite upon the ground . And he smote thrice , and stayed .
12:13:019:0	And the man of God was wroth with him , and said , Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times ; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it : whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice .
12:13:020:0	And Elisha died , and they buried him . And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
12:13:021:0	And it came to pass , as they were burying a man , that , behold , they spied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha : and when the man was let down , and touched the bones of Elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
12:13:022:0	But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
12:13:023:0	And the Lord was gracious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
12:13:024:0	So Hazael king of Syria died ; and Ben–hadad his son reigned in his stead .
12:13:025:0	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben–hadad the son of Hazael the cities , which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war . Three times did Joash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
