12:19:001:0	And it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the .
12:19:002:0	And he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
12:19:003:0	And they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
12:19:004:0	It may be the thy God will hear all the words of Rab–shakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God ; and will reprove the words which the thy God hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left .
12:19:005:0	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
12:19:006:0	And Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say to your master , Thus saith the , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
12:19:007:0	Behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
12:19:008:0	So Rab–shakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
12:19:009:0	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , Behold , he is come out to fight against thee : he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah , saying ,
12:19:010:0	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
12:19:011:0	Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly : and shalt thou be delivered ?
12:19:012:0	Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed ; as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar ?
12:19:013:0	Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivah ?
12:19:014:0	And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up into the house of the , and spread it before the .
12:19:015:0	And Hezekiah prayed before the , and said , O God of Israel , which dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth ; thou hast made heaven and earth .
12:19:016:0	, bow down thine ear , and hear : open , , thine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent him to reproach the living God .
12:19:017:0	Of a truth , , the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands ,
12:19:018:0	And have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
12:19:019:0	Now therefore , O our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the God , even thou only .
12:19:020:0	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the God of Israel , That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard .
12:19:021:0	This is the word that the hath spoken concerning him ; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
12:19:022:0	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
12:19:023:0	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord , and hast said , With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains , to the sides of Lebanon , and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof , and the choice fir trees thereof : and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders , and into the forest of his Carmel .
12:19:024:0	I have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places .
12:19:025:0	Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
12:19:026:0	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
12:19:027:0	But I know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .
12:19:028:0	Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears , therefore I will put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
12:19:029:0	And this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
12:19:030:0	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
12:19:031:0	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the of hosts shall do this .
12:19:032:0	Therefore thus saith the concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
12:19:033:0	By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the .
12:19:034:0	For I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
12:19:035:0	And it came to pass that night , that the angel of the went out , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
12:19:036:0	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at Nineveh .
12:19:037:0	And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . And Esar–haddon his son reigned in his stead .
