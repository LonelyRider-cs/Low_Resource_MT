28:8:001:0	Set the trumpet to thy mouth . He shall come as an eagle against the house of the , because they have transgressed my covenant , and trespassed against my law .
28:8:002:0	Israel shall cry unto me , My God , we know thee .
28:8:003:0	Israel hath cast off the thing that is good : the enemy shall pursue him .
28:8:004:0	They have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
28:8:005:0	Thy calf , O Samaria , hath cast thee off ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
28:8:006:0	For from Israel was it also : the workman made it ; therefore it is not God : but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
28:8:007:0	For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it hath no stalk : the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the strangers shall swallow it up .
28:8:008:0	Israel is swallowed up : now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure .
28:8:009:0	For they are gone up to Assyria , a wild ass alone by himself : Ephraim hath hired lovers .
28:8:010:0	Yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
28:8:011:0	Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin , altars shall be unto him to sin .
28:8:012:0	I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
28:8:013:0	They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eat it ; but the accepteth them not ; now will he remember their iniquity , and visit their sins : they shall return to Egypt .
28:8:014:0	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
