28:9:001:0	Rejoice not , O Israel , for joy , as other people : for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God , thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor .
28:9:002:0	The floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail in her .
28:9:003:0	They shall not dwell in the Lord's land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria .
28:9:004:0	They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord , neither shall they be pleasing unto him : their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners ; all that eat thereof shall be polluted : for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord .
28:9:005:0	What will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of the Lord ?
28:9:006:0	For , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
28:9:007:0	The days of visitation are come , the days of recompence are come ; Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred .
28:9:008:0	The watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
28:9:009:0	They have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah : therefore he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
28:9:010:0	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness ; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time : but they went to Baalâ€“peor , and separated themselves unto that shame ; and their abominations were according as they loved .
28:9:011:0	As for Ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird , from the birth , and from the womb , and from the conception .
28:9:012:0	Though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I depart from them !
28:9:013:0	Ephraim , as I saw Tyre , is planted in a pleasant place : but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer .
28:9:014:0	Give them , O Lord : what wilt thou give ? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
28:9:015:0	All their wickedness is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their princes are revolters .
28:9:016:0	Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
28:9:017:0	My God will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him : and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
