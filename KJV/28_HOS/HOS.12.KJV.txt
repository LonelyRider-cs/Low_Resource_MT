28:12:001:0	Ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lies and desolation ; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
28:12:002:0	The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah , and will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will he recompense him .
28:12:003:0	He took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God :
28:12:004:0	Yea , he had power over the angel , and prevailed : he wept , and made supplication unto him : he found him in Bethâ€“el , and there he spake with us ;
28:12:005:0	Even the Lord God of hosts ; the Lord is his memorial .
28:12:006:0	Therefore turn thou to thy God : keep mercy and judgment , and wait on thy God continually .
28:12:007:0	He is a merchant , the balances of deceit are in his hand : he loveth to oppress .
28:12:008:0	And Ephraim said , Yet I am become rich , I have found me out substance : in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin .
28:12:009:0	And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
28:12:010:0	I have also spoken by the prophets , and I have multiplied visions , and used similitudes , by the ministry of the prophets .
28:12:011:0	Is there iniquity in Gilead ? surely they are vanity : they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields .
28:12:012:0	And Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
28:12:013:0	And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
28:12:014:0	Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him .
