28:7:001:0	When I would have healed Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered , and the wickedness of Samaria : for they commit falsehood ; and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robbers spoileth without .
28:7:002:0	And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before my face .
28:7:003:0	They make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
28:7:004:0	They are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough , until it be leavened .
28:7:005:0	In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scorners .
28:7:006:0	For they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
28:7:007:0	They are all hot as an oven , and have devoured their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
28:7:008:0	Ephraim , he hath mixed himself among the people ; Ephraim is a cake not turned .
28:7:009:0	Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not .
28:7:010:0	And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face : and they do not return to the their God , nor seek him for all this .
28:7:011:0	Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart : they call to Egypt , they go to Assyria .
28:7:012:0	When they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their congregation hath heard .
28:7:013:0	Woe unto them ! for they have fled from me : destruction unto them ! because they have transgressed against me : though I have redeemed them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
28:7:014:0	And they have not cried unto me with their heart , when they howled upon their beds : they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against me .
28:7:015:0	Though I have bound and strengthened their arms , yet do they imagine mischief against me .
28:7:016:0	They return , but not to the most High : they are like a deceitful bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt .
