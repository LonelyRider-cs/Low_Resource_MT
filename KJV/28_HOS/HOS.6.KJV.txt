28:6:001:0	Come , and let us return unto the Lord : for he hath torn , and he will heal us ; he hath smitten , and he will bind us up .
28:6:002:0	After two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
28:6:003:0	Then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
28:6:004:0	O Ephraim , what shall I do unto thee ? O Judah , what shall I do unto thee ? for your goodness is as a morning cloud , and as the early dew it goeth away .
28:6:005:0	Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of my mouth : and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth .
28:6:006:0	For I desired mercy , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings .
28:6:007:0	But they like men have transgressed the covenant : there have they dealt treacherously against me .
28:6:008:0	Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity , and is polluted with blood .
28:6:009:0	And as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests murder in the way by consent : for they commit lewdness .
28:6:010:0	I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel : there is the whoredom of Ephraim , Israel is defiled .
28:6:011:0	Also , O Judah , he hath set an harvest for thee , when I returned the captivity of my people .
