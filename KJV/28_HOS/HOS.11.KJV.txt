28:11:001:0	When Israel was a child , then I loved him , and called my son out of Egypt .
28:11:002:0	As they called them , so they went from them : they sacrificed unto Baalim , and burned incense to graven images .
28:11:003:0	I taught Ephraim also to go , taking them by their arms ; but they knew not that I healed them .
28:11:004:0	I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
28:11:005:0	He shall not return into the land of Egypt , but the Assyrian shall be his king , because they refused to return .
28:11:006:0	And the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
28:11:007:0	And my people are bent to backsliding from me : though they called them to the most High , none at all would exalt him .
28:11:008:0	How shall I give thee up , Ephraim ? how shall I deliver thee , Israel ? how shall I make thee as Admah ? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim ? mine heart is turned within me , my repentings are kindled together .
28:11:009:0	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger , I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of thee : and I will not enter into the city .
28:11:010:0	They shall walk after the Lord : he shall roar like a lion : when he shall roar , then the children shall tremble from the west .
28:11:011:0	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the Lord .
28:11:012:0	Ephraim compasseth me about with lies , and the house of Israel with deceit : but Judah yet ruleth with God , and is faithful with the saints .
