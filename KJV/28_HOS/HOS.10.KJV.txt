28:10:001:0	Israel is an empty vine , he bringeth forth fruit unto himself : according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars ; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images .
28:10:002:0	Their heart is divided ; now shall they be found faulty : he shall break down their altars , he shall spoil their images .
28:10:003:0	For now they shall say , We have no king , because we feared not the Lord ; what then should a king do to us ?
28:10:004:0	They have spoken words , swearing falsely in making a covenant : thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field .
28:10:005:0	The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth–aven : for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it , for the glory thereof , because it is departed from it .
28:10:006:0	It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb : Ephraim shall receive shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
28:10:007:0	As for Samaria , her king is cut off as the foam upon the water .
28:10:008:0	The high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , Cover us ; and to the hills , Fall on us .
28:10:009:0	O Israel , thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah : there they stood : the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them .
28:10:010:0	It is in my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
28:10:011:0	And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught , and loveth to tread out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make Ephraim to ride ; Judah shall plow , and Jacob shall break his clods .
28:10:012:0	Sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up your fallow ground : for it is time to seek the Lord , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
28:10:013:0	Ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
28:10:014:0	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth–arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
28:10:015:0	So shall Beth–el do unto you because of your great wickedness : in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off .
