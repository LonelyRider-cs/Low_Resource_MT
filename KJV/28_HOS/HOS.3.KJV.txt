28:3:001:0	Then said the unto me , Go yet , love a woman beloved of her friend , yet an adulteress , according to the love of the toward the children of Israel , who look to other gods , and love flagons of wine .
28:3:002:0	So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver , and for an homer of barley , and an half homer of barley :
28:3:003:0	And I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
28:3:004:0	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim :
28:3:005:0	Afterward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the their God , and David their king ; and shall fear the and his goodness in the latter days .
