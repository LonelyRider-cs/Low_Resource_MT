28:5:001:0	Hear ye this , O priests ; and hearken , ye house of Israel ; and give ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a snare on Mizpah , and a net spread upon Tabor .
28:5:002:0	And the revolters are profound to make slaughter , though I have been a rebuker of them all .
28:5:003:0	I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O Ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and Israel is defiled .
28:5:004:0	They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the .
28:5:005:0	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity ; Judah also shall fall with them .
28:5:006:0	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the ; but they shall not find him ; he hath withdrawn himself from them .
28:5:007:0	They have dealt treacherously against the : for they have begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their portions .
28:5:008:0	Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah : cry aloud at Bethâ€“aven , after thee , O Benjamin .
28:5:009:0	Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be .
28:5:010:0	The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
28:5:011:0	Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment , because he willingly walked after the commandment .
28:5:012:0	Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
28:5:013:0	When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to king Jareb : yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of your wound .
28:5:014:0	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Judah : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
28:5:015:0	I will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge their offence , and seek my face : in their affliction they will seek me early .
