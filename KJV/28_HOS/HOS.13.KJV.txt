28:13:001:0	When Ephraim spake trembling , he exalted himself in Israel ; but when he offended in Baal , he died .
28:13:002:0	And now they sin more and more , and have made them molten images of their silver , and idols according to their own understanding , all of it the work of the craftsmen : they say of them , Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves .
28:13:003:0	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
28:13:004:0	Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt , and thou shalt know no god but me : for there is no saviour beside me .
28:13:005:0	I did know thee in the wilderness , in the land of great drought .
28:13:006:0	According to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted ; therefore have they forgotten me .
28:13:007:0	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion : as a leopard by the way will I observe them :
28:13:008:0	I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .
28:13:009:0	O Israel , thou hast destroyed thyself ; but in me is thine help .
28:13:010:0	I will be thy king : where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities ? and thy judges of whom thou saidst , Give me a king and princes ?
28:13:011:0	I gave thee a king in mine anger , and took him away in my wrath .
28:13:012:0	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up ; his sin is hid .
28:13:013:0	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him : he is an unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
28:13:014:0	I will ransom them from the power of the grave ; I will redeem them from death : O death , I will be thy plagues ; O grave , I will be thy destruction : repentance shall be hid from mine eyes .
28:13:015:0	Though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
28:13:016:0	Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
