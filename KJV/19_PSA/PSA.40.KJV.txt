19:40:001:0	I waited patiently for the ; and he inclined unto me , and heard my cry .
19:40:002:0	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings .
19:40:003:0	And he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the .
19:40:004:0	Blessed is that man that maketh the his trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
19:40:005:0	Many , O my God , are thy wonderful works which thou hast done , and thy thoughts which are to us-ward : they can not be reckoned up in order unto thee : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be numbered .
19:40:006:0	Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire ; mine ears hast thou opened : burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required .
19:40:007:0	Then said I , Lo , I come : in the volume of the book it is written of me ,
19:40:008:0	I delight to do thy will , O my God : yea , thy law is within my heart .
19:40:009:0	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation : lo , I have not refrained my lips , O , thou knowest .
19:40:010:0	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart ; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation : I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation .
19:40:011:0	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me , O : let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me .
19:40:012:0	For innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
19:40:013:0	Be pleased , O , to deliver me : O , make haste to help me .
19:40:014:0	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it ; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil .
19:40:015:0	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me , Aha , aha .
19:40:016:0	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let such as love thy salvation say continually , The be magnified .
19:40:017:0	But I am poor and needy ; yet the Lord thinketh upon me : thou art my help and my deliverer ; make no tarrying , O my God .
