19:61:001:0	Hear my cry , O God ; attend unto my prayer .
19:61:002:0	From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee , when my heart is overwhelmed : lead me to the rock that is higher than I .
19:61:003:0	For thou hast been a shelter for me , and a strong tower from the enemy .
19:61:004:0	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever : I will trust in the covert of thy wings . Selah .
19:61:005:0	For thou , O God , hast heard my vows : thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name .
19:61:006:0	Thou wilt prolong the king's life : and his years as many generations .
19:61:007:0	He shall abide before God for ever : O prepare mercy and truth , which may preserve him .
19:61:008:0	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever , that I may daily perform my vows .
