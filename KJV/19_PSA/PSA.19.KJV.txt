19:19:001:0	The heavens declare the glory of God ; and the firmament sheweth his handywork .
19:19:002:0	Day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night sheweth knowledge .
19:19:003:0	There is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard .
19:19:004:0	Their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
19:19:005:0	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
19:19:006:0	His going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
19:19:007:0	The law of the Lord is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple .
19:19:008:0	The statutes of the Lord are right , rejoicing the heart : the commandment of the Lord is pure , enlightening the eyes .
19:19:009:0	The fear of the Lord is clean , enduring for ever : the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether .
19:19:010:0	More to be desired are they than gold , yea , than much fine gold : sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb .
19:19:011:0	Moreover by them is thy servant warned : and in keeping of them there is great reward .
19:19:012:0	Who can understand his errors ? cleanse thou me from secret faults .
19:19:013:0	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great transgression .
19:19:014:0	Let the words of my mouth , and the meditation of my heart , be acceptable in thy sight , O Lord , my strength , and my redeemer .
