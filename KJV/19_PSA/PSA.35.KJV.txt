19:35:001:0	Plead my cause , O Lord , with them that strive with me : fight against them that fight against me .
19:35:002:0	Take hold of shield and buckler , and stand up for mine help .
19:35:003:0	Draw out also the spear , and stop the way against them that persecute me : say unto my soul , I am thy salvation .
19:35:004:0	Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
19:35:005:0	Let them be as chaff before the wind : and let the angel of the Lord chase them .
19:35:006:0	Let their way be dark and slippery : and let the angel of the Lord persecute them .
19:35:007:0	For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have digged for my soul .
19:35:008:0	Let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
19:35:009:0	And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord : it shall rejoice in his salvation .
19:35:010:0	All my bones shall say , Lord , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
19:35:011:0	False witnesses did rise up ; they laid to my charge things that I knew not .
19:35:012:0	They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul .
19:35:013:0	But as for me , when they were sick , my clothing was sackcloth : I humbled my soul with fasting ; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom .
19:35:014:0	I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother : I bowed down heavily , as one that mourneth for his mother .
19:35:015:0	But in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
19:35:016:0	With hypocritical mockers in feasts , they gnashed upon me with their teeth .
19:35:017:0	Lord , how long wilt thou look on ? rescue my soul from their destructions , my darling from the lions .
19:35:018:0	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation : I will praise thee among much people .
19:35:019:0	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me : neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause .
19:35:020:0	For they speak not peace : but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land .
19:35:021:0	Yea , they opened their mouth wide against me , and said , Aha , aha , our eye hath seen it .
19:35:022:0	This thou hast seen , O Lord : keep not silence : O Lord , be not far from me .
19:35:023:0	Stir up thyself , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my God and my Lord .
19:35:024:0	Judge me , O Lord my God , according to thy righteousness ; and let them not rejoice over me .
19:35:025:0	Let them not say in their hearts , Ah , so would we have it : let them not say , We have swallowed him up .
19:35:026:0	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt : let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me .
19:35:027:0	Let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let them say continually , Let the Lord be magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
19:35:028:0	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long .
