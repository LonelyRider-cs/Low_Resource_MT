19:13:001:0	How long wilt thou forget me , O Lord ? for ever ? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me ?
19:13:002:0	How long shall I take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart daily ? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me ?
19:13:003:0	Consider and hear me , O Lord my God : lighten mine eyes , lest I sleep the sleep of death ;
19:13:004:0	Lest mine enemy say , I have prevailed against him ; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved .
19:13:005:0	But I have trusted in thy mercy ; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation .
19:13:006:0	I will sing unto the Lord , because he hath dealt bountifully with me .
