19:98:001:0	O sing unto the Lord a new song ; for he hath done marvellous things : his right hand , and his holy arm , hath gotten him the victory .
19:98:002:0	The Lord hath made known his salvation : his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen .
19:98:003:0	He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel : all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
19:98:004:0	Make a joyful noise unto the Lord , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
19:98:005:0	Sing unto the Lord with the harp ; with the harp , and the voice of a psalm .
19:98:006:0	With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the Lord , the King .
19:98:007:0	Let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
19:98:008:0	Let the floods clap their hands : let the hills be joyful together
19:98:009:0	Before the Lord ; for he cometh to judge the earth : with righteousness shall he judge the world , and the people with equity .
