19:33:001:0	Rejoice in the Lord , O ye righteous : for praise is comely for the upright .
19:33:002:0	Praise the Lord with harp : sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings .
19:33:003:0	Sing unto him a new song ; play skilfully with a loud noise .
19:33:004:0	For the word of the Lord is right ; and all his works are done in truth .
19:33:005:0	He loveth righteousness and judgment : the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord .
19:33:006:0	By the word of the Lord were the heavens made ; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth .
19:33:007:0	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap : he layeth up the depth in storehouses .
19:33:008:0	Let all the earth fear the Lord : let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him .
19:33:009:0	For he spake , and it was done ; he commanded , and it stood fast .
19:33:010:0	The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought : he maketh the devices of the people of none effect .
19:33:011:0	The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever , the thoughts of his heart to all generations .
19:33:012:0	Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord ; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance .
19:33:013:0	The Lord looketh from heaven ; he beholdeth all the sons of men .
19:33:014:0	From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth .
19:33:015:0	He fashioneth their hearts alike ; he considereth all their works .
19:33:016:0	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host : a mighty man is not delivered by much strength .
19:33:017:0	An horse is a vain thing for safety : neither shall he deliver any by his great strength .
19:33:018:0	Behold , the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him , upon them that hope in his mercy ;
19:33:019:0	To deliver their soul from death , and to keep them alive in famine .
19:33:020:0	Our soul waiteth for the Lord : he is our help and our shield .
19:33:021:0	For our heart shall rejoice in him , because we have trusted in his holy name .
19:33:022:0	Let thy mercy , O Lord , be upon us , according as we hope in thee .
