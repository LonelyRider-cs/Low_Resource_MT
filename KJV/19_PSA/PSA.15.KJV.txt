19:15:001:0	, who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
19:15:002:0	He that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in his heart .
19:15:003:0	He that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
19:15:004:0	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned ; but he honoureth them that fear the . He that sweareth to his own hurt , and changeth not .
19:15:005:0	He that putteth not out his money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent . He that doeth these things shall never be moved .
