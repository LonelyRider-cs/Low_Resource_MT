19:30:001:0	I will extol thee , O Lord ; for thou hast lifted me up , and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me .
19:30:002:0	O Lord my God , I cried unto thee , and thou hast healed me .
19:30:003:0	O Lord , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave : thou hast kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
19:30:004:0	Sing unto the Lord , O ye saints of his , and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness .
19:30:005:0	For his anger endureth but a moment ; in his favour is life : weeping may endure for a night , but joy cometh in the morning .
19:30:006:0	And in my prosperity I said , I shall never be moved .
19:30:007:0	Lord , by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong : thou didst hide thy face , and I was troubled .
19:30:008:0	I cried to thee , O Lord ; and unto the Lord I made supplication .
19:30:009:0	What profit is there in my blood , when I go down to the pit ? Shall the dust praise thee ? shall it declare thy truth ?
19:30:010:0	Hear , O Lord , and have mercy upon me : Lord , be thou my helper .
19:30:011:0	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing : thou hast put off my sackcloth , and girded me with gladness ;
19:30:012:0	To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . O Lord my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
