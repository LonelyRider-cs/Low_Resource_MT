19:22:001:0	My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? why art thou so far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ?
19:22:002:0	O my God , I cry in the daytime , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
19:22:003:0	But thou art holy , O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel .
19:22:004:0	Our fathers trusted in thee : they trusted , and thou didst deliver them .
19:22:005:0	They cried unto thee , and were delivered : they trusted in thee , and were not confounded .
19:22:006:0	But I am a worm , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised of the people .
19:22:007:0	All they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the head , saying ,
19:22:008:0	He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him : let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in him .
19:22:009:0	But thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts .
19:22:010:0	I was cast upon thee from the womb : thou art my God from my mother's belly .
19:22:011:0	Be not far from me ; for trouble is near ; for there is none to help .
19:22:012:0	Many bulls have compassed me : strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round .
19:22:013:0	They gaped upon me with their mouths , as a ravening and a roaring lion .
19:22:014:0	I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels .
19:22:015:0	My strength is dried up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death .
19:22:016:0	For dogs have compassed me : the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feet .
19:22:017:0	I may tell all my bones : they look and stare upon me .
19:22:018:0	They part my garments among them , and cast lots upon my vesture .
19:22:019:0	But be not thou far from me , O Lord : O my strength , haste thee to help me .
19:22:020:0	Deliver my soul from the sword ; my darling from the power of the dog .
19:22:021:0	Save me from the lion's mouth : for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns .
19:22:022:0	I will declare thy name unto my brethren : in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee .
19:22:023:0	Ye that fear the Lord , praise him ; all ye the seed of Jacob , glorify him ; and fear him , all ye the seed of Israel .
19:22:024:0	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him ; but when he cried unto him , he heard .
19:22:025:0	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation : I will pay my vows before them that fear him .
19:22:026:0	The meek shall eat and be satisfied : they shall praise the Lord that seek him : your heart shall live for ever .
19:22:027:0	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord : and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee .
19:22:028:0	For the kingdom is the Lord's : and he is the governor among the nations .
19:22:029:0	All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
19:22:030:0	A seed shall serve him ; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation .
19:22:031:0	They shall come , and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born , that he hath done this .
