19:4:001:0	Hear me when I call , O God of my righteousness : thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress ; have mercy upon me , and hear my prayer .
19:4:002:0	O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after leasing ? Selah .
19:4:003:0	But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself : the Lord will hear when I call unto him .
19:4:004:0	Stand in awe , and sin not : commune with your own heart upon your bed , and be still . Selah .
19:4:005:0	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness , and put your trust in the Lord .
19:4:006:0	There be many that say , Who will shew us any good ? Lord , lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us .
19:4:007:0	Thou hast put gladness in my heart , more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased .
19:4:008:0	I will both lay me down in peace , and sleep : for thou , Lord , only makest me dwell in safety .
