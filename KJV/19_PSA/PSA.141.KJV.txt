19:141:001:0	, I cry unto thee : make haste unto me ; give ear unto my voice , when I cry unto thee .
19:141:002:0	Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
19:141:003:0	Set a watch , O , before my mouth ; keep the door of my lips .
19:141:004:0	Incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties .
19:141:005:0	Let the righteous smite me ; it shall be a kindness : and let him reprove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities .
19:141:006:0	When their judges are overthrown in stony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are sweet .
19:141:007:0	Our bones are scattered at the grave 's mouth , as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth .
19:141:008:0	But mine eyes are unto thee , O the Lord : in thee is my trust ; leave not my soul destitute .
19:141:009:0	Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me , and the gins of the workers of iniquity .
19:141:010:0	Let the wicked fall into their own nets , whilst that I withal escape .
