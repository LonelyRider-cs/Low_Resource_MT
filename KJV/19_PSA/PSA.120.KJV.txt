19:120:001:0	In my distress I cried unto the Lord , and he heard me .
19:120:002:0	Deliver my soul , O Lord , from lying lips , and from a deceitful tongue .
19:120:003:0	What shall be given unto thee ? or what shall be done unto thee , thou false tongue ?
19:120:004:0	Sharp arrows of the mighty , with coals of juniper .
19:120:005:0	Woe is me , that I sojourn in Meshech , that I dwell in the tents of Kedar !
19:120:006:0	My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace .
19:120:007:0	I am for peace : but when I speak , they are for war .
