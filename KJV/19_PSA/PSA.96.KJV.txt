19:96:001:0	O sing unto the Lord a new song : sing unto the Lord , all the earth .
19:96:002:0	Sing unto the Lord , bless his name ; shew forth his salvation from day to day .
19:96:003:0	Declare his glory among the heathen , his wonders among all people .
19:96:004:0	For the Lord is great , and greatly to be praised : he is to be feared above all gods .
19:96:005:0	For all the gods of the nations are idols : but the Lord made the heavens .
19:96:006:0	Honour and majesty are before him : strength and beauty are in his sanctuary .
19:96:007:0	Give unto the Lord , O ye kindreds of the people , give unto the Lord glory and strength .
19:96:008:0	Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come into his courts .
19:96:009:0	O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness : fear before him , all the earth .
19:96:010:0	Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth : the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved : he shall judge the people righteously .
19:96:011:0	Let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof .
19:96:012:0	Let the field be joyful , and all that is therein : then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
19:96:013:0	Before the Lord : for he cometh , for he cometh to judge the earth : he shall judge the world with righteousness , and the people with his truth .
