19:125:001:0	They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion , which cannot be removed , but abideth for ever .
19:125:002:0	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem , so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever .
19:125:003:0	For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous ; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity .
19:125:004:0	Do good , O Lord , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
19:125:005:0	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
