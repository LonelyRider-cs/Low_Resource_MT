19:7:001:0	O my God , in thee do I put my trust : save me from all them that persecute me , and deliver me :
19:7:002:0	Lest he tear my soul like a lion , rending it in pieces , while there is none to deliver .
19:7:003:0	O my God , if I have done this ; if there be iniquity in my hands ;
19:7:004:0	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
19:7:005:0	Let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let him tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust . Selah .
19:7:006:0	Arise , O , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
19:7:007:0	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about : for their sakes therefore return thou on high .
19:7:008:0	The shall judge the people : judge me , O , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
19:7:009:0	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end ; but establish the just : for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins .
19:7:010:0	My defence is of God , which saveth the upright in heart .
19:7:011:0	God judgeth the righteous , and God is angry with the wicked every day .
19:7:012:0	If he turn not , he will whet his sword ; he hath bent his bow , and made it ready .
19:7:013:0	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors .
19:7:014:0	Behold , he travaileth with iniquity , and hath conceived mischief , and brought forth falsehood .
19:7:015:0	He made a pit , and digged it , and is fallen into the ditch which he made .
19:7:016:0	His mischief shall return upon his own head , and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate .
19:7:017:0	I will praise the according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the most high .
