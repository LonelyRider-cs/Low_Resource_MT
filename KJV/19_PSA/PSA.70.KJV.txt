19:70:001:0	Make haste , O God , to deliver me ; make haste to help me , O Lord .
19:70:002:0	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
19:70:003:0	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say , Aha , aha .
19:70:004:0	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say continually , Let God be magnified .
19:70:005:0	But I am poor and needy : make haste unto me , O God : thou art my help and my deliverer ; O Lord , make no tarrying .
