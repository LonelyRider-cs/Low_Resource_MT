19:77:001:0	I cried unto God with my voice , even unto God with my voice ; and he gave ear unto me .
19:77:002:0	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sore ran in the night , and ceased not : my soul refused to be comforted .
19:77:003:0	I remembered God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit was overwhelmed . Selah .
19:77:004:0	Thou holdest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I can not speak .
19:77:005:0	I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
19:77:006:0	I call to remembrance my song in the night : I commune with mine own heart : and my spirit made diligent search .
19:77:007:0	Will the Lord cast off for ever ? and will he be favourable no more ?
19:77:008:0	Is his mercy clean gone for ever ? doth his promise fail for evermore ?
19:77:009:0	Hath God forgotten to be gracious ? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies ? Selah .
19:77:010:0	And I said , This is my infirmity : but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High .
19:77:011:0	I will remember the works of the : surely I will remember thy wonders of old .
19:77:012:0	I will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings .
19:77:013:0	Thy way , O God , is in the sanctuary : who is so great a God as our God ?
19:77:014:0	Thou art the God that doest wonders : thou hast declared thy strength among the people .
19:77:015:0	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people , the sons of Jacob and Joseph . Selah .
19:77:016:0	The waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee ; they were afraid : the depths also were troubled .
19:77:017:0	The clouds poured out water : the skies sent out a sound : thine arrows also went abroad .
19:77:018:0	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook .
19:77:019:0	Thy way is in the sea , and thy path in the great waters , and thy footsteps are not known .
19:77:020:0	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron .
