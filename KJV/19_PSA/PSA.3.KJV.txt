19:3:001:0	Lord , how are they increased that trouble me ! many are they that rise up against me .
19:3:002:0	Many there be which say of my soul , There is no help for him in God . Selah .
19:3:003:0	But thou , O Lord , art a shield for me ; my glory , and the lifter up of mine head .
19:3:004:0	I cried unto the Lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his holy hill . Selah .
19:3:005:0	I laid me down and slept ; I awaked ; for the Lord sustained me .
19:3:006:0	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
19:3:007:0	Arise , O Lord ; save me , O my God : for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
19:3:008:0	Salvation belongeth unto the Lord : thy blessing is upon thy people . Selah .
