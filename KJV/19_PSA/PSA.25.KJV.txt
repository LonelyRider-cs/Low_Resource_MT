19:25:001:0	Unto thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul .
19:25:002:0	O my God , I trust in thee : let me not be ashamed , let not mine enemies triumph over me .
19:25:003:0	Yea , let none that wait on thee be ashamed : let them be ashamed which transgress without cause .
19:25:004:0	Shew me thy ways , O Lord ; teach me thy paths .
19:25:005:0	Lead me in thy truth , and teach me : for thou art the God of my salvation ; on thee do I wait all the day .
19:25:006:0	Remember , O Lord , thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses ; for they have been ever of old .
19:25:007:0	Remember not the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions : according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake , O Lord .
19:25:008:0	Good and upright is the Lord : therefore will he teach sinners in the way .
19:25:009:0	The meek will he guide in judgment : and the meek will he teach his way .
19:25:010:0	All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies .
19:25:011:0	For thy name's sake , O Lord , pardon mine iniquity ; for it is great .
19:25:012:0	What man is he that feareth the Lord ? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose .
19:25:013:0	His soul shall dwell at ease ; and his seed shall inherit the earth .
19:25:014:0	The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him ; and he will shew them his covenant .
19:25:015:0	Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord ; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net .
19:25:016:0	Turn thee unto me , and have mercy upon me ; for I am desolate and afflicted .
19:25:017:0	The troubles of my heart are enlarged : O bring thou me out of my distresses .
19:25:018:0	Look upon mine affliction and my pain ; and forgive all my sins .
19:25:019:0	Consider mine enemies ; for they are many ; and they hate me with cruel hatred .
19:25:020:0	O keep my soul , and deliver me : let me not be ashamed ; for I put my trust in thee .
19:25:021:0	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me ; for I wait on thee .
19:25:022:0	Redeem Israel , O God , out of all his troubles .
