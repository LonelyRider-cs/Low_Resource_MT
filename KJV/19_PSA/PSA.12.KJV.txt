19:12:001:0	Help , Lord ; for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithful fail from among the children of men .
19:12:002:0	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak .
19:12:003:0	The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that speaketh proud things :
19:12:004:0	Who have said , With our tongue will we prevail ; our lips are our own : who is lord over us ?
19:12:005:0	For the oppression of the poor , for the sighing of the needy , now will I arise , saith the Lord ; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him .
19:12:006:0	The words of the Lord are pure words : as silver tried in a furnace of earth , purified seven times .
19:12:007:0	Thou shalt keep them , O Lord , thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever .
19:12:008:0	The wicked walk on every side , when the vilest men are exalted .
