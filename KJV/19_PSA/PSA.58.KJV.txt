19:58:001:0	Do ye indeed speak righteousness , O congregation ? do ye judge uprightly , O ye sons of men ?
19:58:002:0	Yea , in heart ye work wickedness ; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth .
19:58:003:0	The wicked are estranged from the womb : they go astray as soon as they be born , speaking lies .
19:58:004:0	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent : they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear ;
19:58:005:0	Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers , charming never so wisely .
19:58:006:0	Break their teeth , O God , in their mouth : break out the great teeth of the young lions , O Lord .
19:58:007:0	Let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
19:58:008:0	As a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
19:58:009:0	Before your pots can feel the thorns , he shall take them away as with a whirlwind , both living , and in his wrath .
19:58:010:0	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
19:58:011:0	So that a man shall say , Verily there is a reward for the righteous : verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth .
