19:79:001:0	O God , the heathen are come into thine inheritance ; thy holy temple have they defiled ; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps .
19:79:002:0	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth .
19:79:003:0	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem ; and there was none to bury them .
19:79:004:0	We are become a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and derision to them that are round about us .
19:79:005:0	How long , Lord ? wilt thou be angry for ever ? shall thy jealousy burn like fire ?
19:79:006:0	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name .
19:79:007:0	For they have devoured Jacob , and laid waste his dwelling place .
19:79:008:0	O remember not against us former iniquities : let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us : for we are brought very low .
19:79:009:0	Help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of thy name : and deliver us , and purge away our sins , for thy name's sake .
19:79:010:0	Wherefore should the heathen say , Where is their God ? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed .
19:79:011:0	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ;
19:79:012:0	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach , wherewith they have reproached thee , O Lord .
19:79:013:0	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever : we will shew forth thy praise to all generations .
