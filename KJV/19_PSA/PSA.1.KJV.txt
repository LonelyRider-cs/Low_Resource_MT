19:1:001:0	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
19:1:002:0	But his delight is in the law of the ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night .
19:1:003:0	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
19:1:004:0	The ungodly are not so : but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away .
19:1:005:0	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous .
19:1:006:0	For the knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish .
