19:75:001:0	Unto thee , O God , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare .
19:75:002:0	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly .
19:75:003:0	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : I bear up the pillars of it . Selah .
19:75:004:0	I said unto the fools , Deal not foolishly : and to the wicked , Lift not up the horn :
19:75:005:0	Lift not up your horn on high : speak not with a stiff neck .
19:75:006:0	For promotion cometh neither from the east , nor from the west , nor from the south .
19:75:007:0	But God is the judge : he putteth down one , and setteth up another .
19:75:008:0	For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup , and the wine is red ; it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drink them .
19:75:009:0	But I will declare for ever ; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob .
19:75:010:0	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
