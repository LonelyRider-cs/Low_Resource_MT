19:131:001:0	, my heart is not haughty , nor mine eyes lofty : neither do I exercise myself in great matters , or in things too high for me .
19:131:002:0	Surely I have behaved and quieted myself , as a child that is weaned of his mother : my soul is even as a weaned child .
19:131:003:0	Let Israel hope in the from henceforth and for ever .
