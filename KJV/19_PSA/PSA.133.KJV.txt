19:133:001:0	Behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity !
19:133:002:0	It is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron 's beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
19:133:003:0	As the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
