19:94:001:0	O Lord God , to whom vengeance belongeth ; O God , to whom vengeance belongeth , shew thyself .
19:94:002:0	Lift up thyself , thou judge of the earth : render a reward to the proud .
19:94:003:0	Lord , how long shall the wicked , how long shall the wicked triumph ?
19:94:004:0	How long shall they utter and speak hard things ? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves ?
19:94:005:0	They break in pieces thy people , O Lord , and afflict thine heritage .
19:94:006:0	They slay the widow and the stranger , and murder the fatherless .
19:94:007:0	Yet they say , The Lord shall not see , neither shall the God of Jacob regard it .
19:94:008:0	Understand , ye brutish among the people : and ye fools , when will ye be wise ?
19:94:009:0	He that planted the ear , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
19:94:010:0	He that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
19:94:011:0	The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man , that they are vanity .
19:94:012:0	Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest , O Lord , and teachest him out of thy law ;
19:94:013:0	That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit be digged for the wicked .
19:94:014:0	For the Lord will not cast off his people , neither will he forsake his inheritance .
19:94:015:0	But judgment shall return unto righteousness : and all the upright in heart shall follow it .
19:94:016:0	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers ? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity ?
19:94:017:0	Unless the Lord had been my help , my soul had almost dwelt in silence .
19:94:018:0	When I said , My foot slippeth ; thy mercy , O Lord , held me up .
19:94:019:0	In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul .
19:94:020:0	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ?
19:94:021:0	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
19:94:022:0	But the Lord is my defence ; and my God is the rock of my refuge .
19:94:023:0	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; yea , the Lord our God shall cut them off .
