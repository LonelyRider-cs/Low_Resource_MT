19:100:001:0	Make a joyful noise unto the Lord , all ye lands .
19:100:002:0	Serve the Lord with gladness : come before his presence with singing .
19:100:003:0	Know ye that the Lord he is God : it is he that hath made us , and not we ourselves ; we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
19:100:004:0	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving , and into his courts with praise : be thankful unto him , and bless his name .
19:100:005:0	For the Lord is good ; his mercy is everlasting ; and his truth endureth to all generations .
