19:90:001:0	Lord , thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations .
19:90:002:0	Before the mountains were brought forth , or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , thou art God .
19:90:003:0	Thou turnest man to destruction ; and sayest , Return , ye children of men .
19:90:004:0	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night .
19:90:005:0	Thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up .
19:90:006:0	In the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and withereth .
19:90:007:0	For we are consumed by thine anger , and by thy wrath are we troubled .
19:90:008:0	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee , our secret sins in the light of thy countenance .
19:90:009:0	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath : we spend our years as a tale that is told .
19:90:010:0	The days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
19:90:011:0	Who knoweth the power of thine anger ? even according to thy fear , so is thy wrath .
19:90:012:0	So teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom .
19:90:013:0	Return , O Lord , how long ? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants .
19:90:014:0	O satisfy us early with thy mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
19:90:015:0	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us , and the years wherein we have seen evil .
19:90:016:0	Let thy work appear unto thy servants , and thy glory unto their children .
19:90:017:0	And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
