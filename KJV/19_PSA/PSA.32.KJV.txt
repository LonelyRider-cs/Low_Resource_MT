19:32:001:0	Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven , whose sin is covered .
19:32:002:0	Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity , and in whose spirit there is no guile .
19:32:003:0	When I kept silence , my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long .
19:32:004:0	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me : my moisture is turned into the drought of summer . Selah .
19:32:005:0	I acknowledged my sin unto thee , and mine iniquity have I not hid . I said , I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin . Selah .
19:32:006:0	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
19:32:007:0	Thou art my hiding place ; thou shalt preserve me from trouble ; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance . Selah .
19:32:008:0	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go : I will guide thee with mine eye .
19:32:009:0	Be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
19:32:010:0	Many sorrows shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the Lord , mercy shall compass him about .
19:32:011:0	Be glad in the Lord , and rejoice , ye righteous : and shout for joy , all ye that are upright in heart .
