19:86:001:0	Bow down thine ear , O Lord , hear me : for I am poor and needy .
19:86:002:0	Preserve my soul ; for I am holy : O thou my God , save thy servant that trusteth in thee .
19:86:003:0	Be merciful unto me , O Lord : for I cry unto thee daily .
19:86:004:0	Rejoice the soul of thy servant : for unto thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul .
19:86:005:0	For thou , Lord , art good , and ready to forgive ; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee .
19:86:006:0	Give ear , O Lord , unto my prayer ; and attend to the voice of my supplications .
19:86:007:0	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer me .
19:86:008:0	Among the gods there is none like unto thee , O Lord ; neither are there any works like unto thy works .
19:86:009:0	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee , O Lord ; and shall glorify thy name .
19:86:010:0	For thou art great , and doest wondrous things : thou art God alone .
19:86:011:0	Teach me thy way , O Lord ; I will walk in thy truth : unite my heart to fear thy name .
19:86:012:0	I will praise thee , O Lord my God , with all my heart : and I will glorify thy name for evermore .
19:86:013:0	For great is thy mercy toward me : and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell .
19:86:014:0	O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
19:86:015:0	But thou , O Lord , art a God full of compassion , and gracious , longsuffering , and plenteous in mercy and truth .
19:86:016:0	O turn unto me , and have mercy upon me ; give thy strength unto thy servant , and save the son of thine handmaid .
19:86:017:0	Shew me a token for good ; that they which hate me may see it , and be ashamed : because thou , Lord , hast holpen me , and comforted me .
