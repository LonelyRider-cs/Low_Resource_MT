19:6:001:0	O Lord , rebuke me not in thine anger , neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure .
19:6:002:0	Have mercy upon me , O Lord ; for I am weak : O Lord , heal me ; for my bones are vexed .
19:6:003:0	My soul is also sore vexed : but thou , O Lord , how long ?
19:6:004:0	Return , O Lord , deliver my soul : oh save me for thy mercies' sake .
19:6:005:0	For in death there is no remembrance of thee : in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?
19:6:006:0	I am weary with my groaning ; all the night make I my bed to swim ; I water my couch with my tears .
19:6:007:0	Mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies .
19:6:008:0	Depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity ; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping .
19:6:009:0	The Lord hath heard my supplication ; the Lord will receive my prayer .
19:6:010:0	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed : let them return and be ashamed suddenly .
