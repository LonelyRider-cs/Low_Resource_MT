19:65:001:0	Praise waiteth for thee , O God , in Zion : and unto thee shall the vow be performed .
19:65:002:0	O thou that hearest prayer , unto thee shall all flesh come .
19:65:003:0	Iniquities prevail against me : as for our transgressions , thou shalt purge them away .
19:65:004:0	Blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
19:65:005:0	By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
19:65:006:0	Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains ; being girded with power :
19:65:007:0	Which stilleth the noise of the seas , the noise of their waves , and the tumult of the people .
19:65:008:0	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice .
19:65:009:0	Thou visitest the earth , and waterest it : thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God , which is full of water : thou preparest them corn , when thou hast so provided for it .
19:65:010:0	Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrows thereof : thou makest it soft with showers : thou blessest the springing thereof .
19:65:011:0	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness ; and thy paths drop fatness .
19:65:012:0	They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness : and the little hills rejoice on every side .
19:65:013:0	The pastures are clothed with flocks ; the valleys also are covered over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
