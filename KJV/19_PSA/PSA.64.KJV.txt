19:64:001:0	Hear my voice , O God , in my prayer : preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
19:64:002:0	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked ; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity :
19:64:003:0	Who whet their tongue like a sword , and bend their bows to shoot their arrows , even bitter words :
19:64:004:0	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
19:64:005:0	They encourage themselves in an evil matter : they commune of laying snares privily ; they say , Who shall see them ?
19:64:006:0	They search out iniquities ; they accomplish a diligent search : both the inward thought of every one of them , and the heart , is deep .
19:64:007:0	But God shall shoot at them with an arrow ; suddenly shall they be wounded .
19:64:008:0	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
19:64:009:0	And all men shall fear , and shall declare the work of God ; for they shall wisely consider of his doing .
19:64:010:0	The righteous shall be glad in the , and shall trust in him ; and all the upright in heart shall glory .
