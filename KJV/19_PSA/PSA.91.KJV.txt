19:91:001:0	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty .
19:91:002:0	I will say of the Lord , He is my refuge and my fortress : my God ; in him will I trust .
19:91:003:0	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , and from the noisome pestilence .
19:91:004:0	He shall cover thee with his feathers , and under his wings shalt thou trust : his truth shall be thy shield and buckler .
19:91:005:0	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ;
19:91:006:0	Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday .
19:91:007:0	A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee .
19:91:008:0	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked .
19:91:009:0	Because thou hast made the Lord , which is my refuge , even the most High , thy habitation ;
19:91:010:0	There shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling .
19:91:011:0	For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
19:91:012:0	They shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone .
19:91:013:0	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet .
19:91:014:0	Because he hath set his love upon me , therefore will I deliver him : I will set him on high , because he hath known my name .
19:91:015:0	He shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
19:91:016:0	With long life will I satisfy him , and shew him my salvation .
