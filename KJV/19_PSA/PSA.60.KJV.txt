19:60:001:0	O God , thou hast cast us off , thou hast scattered us , thou hast been displeased ; O turn thyself to us again .
19:60:002:0	Thou hast made the earth to tremble ; thou hast broken it : heal the breaches thereof ; for it shaketh .
19:60:003:0	Thou hast shewed thy people hard things : thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment .
19:60:004:0	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
19:60:005:0	That thy beloved may be delivered ; save with thy right hand , and hear me .
19:60:006:0	God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth .
19:60:007:0	Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
19:60:008:0	Moab is my washpot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe : Philistia , triumph thou because of me .
19:60:009:0	Who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into Edom ?
19:60:010:0	Wilt not thou , O God , which hadst cast us off ? and thou , O God , which didst not go out with our armies ?
19:60:011:0	Give us help from trouble : for vain is the help of man .
19:60:012:0	Through God we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
