19:88:001:0	O God of my salvation , I have cried day and night before thee :
19:88:002:0	Let my prayer come before thee : incline thine ear unto my cry ;
19:88:003:0	For my soul is full of troubles : and my life draweth nigh unto the grave .
19:88:004:0	I am counted with them that go down into the pit : I am as a man that hath no strength :
19:88:005:0	Free among the dead , like the slain that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cut off from thy hand .
19:88:006:0	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit , in darkness , in the deeps .
19:88:007:0	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me , and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves . Selah .
19:88:008:0	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I can not come forth .
19:88:009:0	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction : , I have called daily upon thee , I have stretched out my hands unto thee .
19:88:010:0	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead ? shall the dead arise and praise thee ? Selah .
19:88:011:0	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave ? or thy faithfulness in destruction ?
19:88:012:0	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark ? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
19:88:013:0	But unto thee have I cried , O ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee .
19:88:014:0	, why castest thou off my soul ? why hidest thou thy face from me ?
19:88:015:0	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up : while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted .
19:88:016:0	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me ; thy terrors have cut me off .
19:88:017:0	They came round about me daily like water ; they compassed me about together .
19:88:018:0	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me , and mine acquaintance into darkness .
