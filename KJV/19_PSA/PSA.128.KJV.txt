19:128:001:0	Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord ; that walketh in his ways .
19:128:002:0	For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
19:128:003:0	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house : thy children like olive plants round about thy table .
19:128:004:0	Behold , that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord .
19:128:005:0	The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion : and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life .
19:128:006:0	Yea , thou shalt see thy children's children , and peace upon Israel .
