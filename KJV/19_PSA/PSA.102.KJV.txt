19:102:001:0	Hear my prayer , O Lord , and let my cry come unto thee .
19:102:002:0	Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; incline thine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me speedily .
19:102:003:0	For my days are consumed like smoke , and my bones are burned as an hearth .
19:102:004:0	My heart is smitten , and withered like grass ; so that I forget to eat my bread .
19:102:005:0	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin .
19:102:006:0	I am like a pelican of the wilderness : I am like an owl of the desert .
19:102:007:0	I watch , and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top .
19:102:008:0	Mine enemies reproach me all the day ; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me .
19:102:009:0	For I have eaten ashes like bread , and mingled my drink with weeping ,
19:102:010:0	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me up , and cast me down .
19:102:011:0	My days are like a shadow that declineth ; and I am withered like grass .
19:102:012:0	But thou , O Lord , shalt endure for ever ; and thy remembrance unto all generations .
19:102:013:0	Thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon Zion : for the time to favour her , yea , the set time , is come .
19:102:014:0	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones , and favour the dust thereof .
19:102:015:0	So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord , and all the kings of the earth thy glory .
19:102:016:0	When the Lord shall build up Zion , he shall appear in his glory .
19:102:017:0	He will regard the prayer of the destitute , and not despise their prayer .
19:102:018:0	This shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord .
19:102:019:0	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary ; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth ;
19:102:020:0	To hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that are appointed to death ;
19:102:021:0	To declare the name of the Lord in Zion , and his praise in Jerusalem ;
19:102:022:0	When the people are gathered together , and the kingdoms , to serve the Lord .
19:102:023:0	He weakened my strength in the way ; he shortened my days .
19:102:024:0	I said , O my God , take me not away in the midst of my days : thy years are throughout all generations .
19:102:025:0	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth : and the heavens are the work of thy hands .
19:102:026:0	They shall perish , but thou shalt endure : yea , all of them shall wax old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shall be changed :
19:102:027:0	But thou art the same , and thy years shall have no end .
19:102:028:0	The children of thy servants shall continue , and their seed shall be established before thee .
