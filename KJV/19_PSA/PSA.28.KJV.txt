19:28:001:0	Unto thee will I cry , O Lord my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if thou be silent to me , I become like them that go down into the pit .
19:28:002:0	Hear the voice of my supplications , when I cry unto thee , when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle .
19:28:003:0	Draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of iniquity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mischief is in their hearts .
19:28:004:0	Give them according to their deeds , and according to the wickedness of their endeavours : give them after the work of their hands ; render to them their desert .
19:28:005:0	Because they regard not the works of the Lord , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up .
19:28:006:0	Blessed be the Lord , because he hath heard the voice of my supplications .
19:28:007:0	The Lord is my strength and my shield ; my heart trusted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth ; and with my song will I praise him .
19:28:008:0	The Lord is their strength , and he is the saving strength of his anointed .
19:28:009:0	Save thy people , and bless thine inheritance : feed them also , and lift them up for ever .
