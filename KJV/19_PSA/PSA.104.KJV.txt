19:104:001:0	Bless the Lord , O my soul . O Lord my God , thou art very great ; thou art clothed with honour and majesty .
19:104:002:0	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment : who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain :
19:104:003:0	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters : who maketh the clouds his chariot : who walketh upon the wings of the wind :
19:104:004:0	Who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flaming fire :
19:104:005:0	Who laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be removed for ever .
19:104:006:0	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment : the waters stood above the mountains .
19:104:007:0	At thy rebuke they fled ; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away .
19:104:008:0	They go up by the mountains ; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them .
19:104:009:0	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over ; that they turn not again to cover the earth .
19:104:010:0	He sendeth the springs into the valleys , which run among the hills .
19:104:011:0	They give drink to every beast of the field : the wild asses quench their thirst .
19:104:012:0	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation , which sing among the branches .
19:104:013:0	He watereth the hills from his chambers : the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works .
19:104:014:0	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;
19:104:015:0	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man's heart .
19:104:016:0	The trees of the Lord are full of sap ; the cedars of Lebanon , which he hath planted ;
19:104:017:0	Where the birds make their nests : as for the stork , the fir trees are her house .
19:104:018:0	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats ; and the rocks for the conies .
19:104:019:0	He appointed the moon for seasons : the sun knoweth his going down .
19:104:020:0	Thou makest darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth .
19:104:021:0	The young lions roar after their prey , and seek their meat from God .
19:104:022:0	The sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their dens .
19:104:023:0	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening .
19:104:024:0	O Lord , how manifold are thy works ! in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches .
19:104:025:0	So is this great and wide sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable , both small and great beasts .
19:104:026:0	There go the ships : there is that leviathan , whom thou hast made to play therein .
19:104:027:0	These wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season .
19:104:028:0	That thou givest them they gather : thou openest thine hand , they are filled with good .
19:104:029:0	Thou hidest thy face , they are troubled : thou takest away their breath , they die , and return to their dust .
19:104:030:0	Thou sendest forth thy spirit , they are created : and thou renewest the face of the earth .
19:104:031:0	The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever : the Lord shall rejoice in his works .
19:104:032:0	He looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hills , and they smoke .
19:104:033:0	I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live : I will sing praise to my God while I have my being .
19:104:034:0	My meditation of him shall be sweet : I will be glad in the Lord .
19:104:035:0	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth , and let the wicked be no more . Bless thou the Lord , O my soul . Praise ye the Lord .
