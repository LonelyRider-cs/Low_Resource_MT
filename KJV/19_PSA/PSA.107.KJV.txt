19:107:001:0	O give thanks unto the Lord , for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
19:107:002:0	Let the redeemed of the Lord say so , whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy ;
19:107:003:0	And gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
19:107:004:0	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they found no city to dwell in .
19:107:005:0	Hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted in them .
19:107:006:0	Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their distresses .
19:107:007:0	And he led them forth by the right way , that they might go to a city of habitation .
19:107:008:0	Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
19:107:009:0	For he satisfieth the longing soul , and filleth the hungry soul with goodness .
19:107:010:0	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound in affliction and iron ;
19:107:011:0	Because they rebelled against the words of God , and contemned the counsel of the most High :
19:107:012:0	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour ; they fell down , and there was none to help .
19:107:013:0	Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses .
19:107:014:0	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and brake their bands in sunder .
19:107:015:0	Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
19:107:016:0	For he hath broken the gates of brass , and cut the bars of iron in sunder .
19:107:017:0	Fools because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
19:107:018:0	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat ; and they draw near unto the gates of death .
19:107:019:0	Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and he saveth them out of their distresses .
19:107:020:0	He sent his word , and healed them , and delivered them from their destructions .
19:107:021:0	Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
19:107:022:0	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and declare his works with rejoicing .
19:107:023:0	They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ;
19:107:024:0	These see the works of the Lord , and his wonders in the deep .
19:107:025:0	For he commandeth , and raiseth the stormy wind , which lifteth up the waves thereof .
19:107:026:0	They mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : their soul is melted because of trouble .
19:107:027:0	They reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits' end .
19:107:028:0	Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and he bringeth them out of their distresses .
19:107:029:0	He maketh the storm a calm , so that the waves thereof are still .
19:107:030:0	Then are they glad because they be quiet ; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven .
19:107:031:0	Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
19:107:032:0	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the elders .
19:107:033:0	He turneth rivers into a wilderness , and the watersprings into dry ground ;
19:107:034:0	A fruitful land into barrenness , for the wickedness of them that dwell therein .
19:107:035:0	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water , and dry ground into watersprings .
19:107:036:0	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare a city for habitation ;
19:107:037:0	And sow the fields , and plant vineyards , which may yield fruits of increase .
19:107:038:0	He blesseth them also , so that they are multiplied greatly ; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease .
19:107:039:0	Again , they are minished and brought low through oppression , affliction , and sorrow .
19:107:040:0	He poureth contempt upon princes , and causeth them to wander in the wilderness , where there is no way .
19:107:041:0	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction , and maketh him families like a flock .
19:107:042:0	The righteous shall see it , and rejoice : and all iniquity shall stop her mouth .
19:107:043:0	Whoso is wise , and will observe these things , even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord .
