19:126:001:0	When the turned again the captivity of Zion , we were like them that dream .
19:126:002:0	Then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing : then said they among the heathen , The hath done great things for them .
19:126:003:0	The hath done great things for us ; whereof we are glad .
19:126:004:0	Turn again our captivity , O , as the streams in the south .
19:126:005:0	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy .
19:126:006:0	He that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him .
