19:29:001:0	Give unto the , O ye mighty , give unto the glory and strength .
19:29:002:0	Give unto the the glory due unto his name ; worship the in the beauty of holiness .
19:29:003:0	The voice of the is upon the waters : the God of glory thundereth : the is upon many waters .
19:29:004:0	The voice of the is powerful ; the voice of the is full of majesty .
19:29:005:0	The voice of the breaketh the cedars ; yea , the breaketh the cedars of Lebanon .
19:29:006:0	He maketh them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn .
19:29:007:0	The voice of the divideth the flames of fire .
19:29:008:0	The voice of the shaketh the wilderness ; the shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh .
19:29:009:0	The voice of the maketh the hinds to calve , and discovereth the forests : and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory .
19:29:010:0	The sitteth upon the flood ; yea , the sitteth King for ever .
19:29:011:0	The will give strength unto his people ; the will bless his people with peace .
