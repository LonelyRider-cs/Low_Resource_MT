19:44:001:0	We have heard with our ears , O God , our fathers have told us , what work thou didst in their days , in the times of old .
19:44:002:0	How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand , and plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
19:44:003:0	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them : but thy right hand , and thine arm , and the light of thy countenance , because thou hadst a favour unto them .
19:44:004:0	Thou art my King , O God : command deliverances for Jacob .
19:44:005:0	Through thee will we push down our enemies : through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us .
19:44:006:0	For I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me .
19:44:007:0	But thou hast saved us from our enemies , and hast put them to shame that hated us .
19:44:008:0	In God we boast all the day long , and praise thy name for ever . Selah .
19:44:009:0	But thou hast cast off , and put us to shame ; and goest not forth with our armies .
19:44:010:0	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy : and they which hate us spoil for themselves .
19:44:011:0	Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat ; and hast scattered us among the heathen .
19:44:012:0	Thou sellest thy people for nought , and dost not increase thy wealth by their price .
19:44:013:0	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us .
19:44:014:0	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen , a shaking of the head among the people .
19:44:015:0	My confusion is continually before me , and the shame of my face hath covered me ,
19:44:016:0	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth ; by reason of the enemy and avenger .
19:44:017:0	All this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant .
19:44:018:0	Our heart is not turned back , neither have our steps declined from thy way ;
19:44:019:0	Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons , and covered us with the shadow of death .
19:44:020:0	If we have forgotten the name of our God , or stretched out our hands to a strange god ;
19:44:021:0	Shall not God search this out ? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart .
19:44:022:0	Yea , for thy sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter .
19:44:023:0	Awake , why sleepest thou , O Lord ? arise , cast us not off for ever .
19:44:024:0	Wherefore hidest thou thy face , and forgettest our affliction and our oppression ?
19:44:025:0	For our soul is bowed down to the dust : our belly cleaveth unto the earth .
19:44:026:0	Arise for our help , and redeem us for thy mercies ' sake .
