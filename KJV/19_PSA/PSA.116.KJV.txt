19:116:001:0	I love the , because he hath heard my voice and my supplications .
19:116:002:0	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me , therefore will I call upon him as long as I live .
19:116:003:0	The sorrows of death compassed me , and the pains of hell gat hold upon me : I found trouble and sorrow .
19:116:004:0	Then called I upon the name of the ; O , I beseech thee , deliver my soul .
19:116:005:0	Gracious is the , and righteous ; yea , our God is merciful .
19:116:006:0	The preserveth the simple : I was brought low , and he helped me .
19:116:007:0	Return unto thy rest , O my soul ; for the hath dealt bountifully with thee .
19:116:008:0	For thou hast delivered my soul from death , mine eyes from tears , and my feet from falling .
19:116:009:0	I will walk before the in the land of the living .
19:116:010:0	I believed , therefore have I spoken : I was greatly afflicted :
19:116:011:0	I said in my haste , All men are liars .
19:116:012:0	What shall I render unto the for all his benefits toward me ?
19:116:013:0	I will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the .
19:116:014:0	I will pay my vows unto the now in the presence of all his people .
19:116:015:0	Precious in the sight of the is the death of his saints .
19:116:016:0	O , truly I am thy servant ; I am thy servant , and the son of thine handmaid : thou hast loosed my bonds .
19:116:017:0	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving , and will call upon the name of the .
19:116:018:0	I will pay my vows unto the now in the presence of all his people ,
19:116:019:0	In the courts of the house , in the midst of thee , O Jerusalem . Praise ye the .
