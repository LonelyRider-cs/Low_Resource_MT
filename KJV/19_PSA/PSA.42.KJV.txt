19:42:001:0	As the hart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , O God .
19:42:002:0	My soul thirsteth for God , for the living God : when shall I come and appear before God ?
19:42:003:0	My tears have been my meat day and night , while they continually say unto me , Where is thy God ?
19:42:004:0	When I remember these things , I pour out my soul in me : for I had gone with the multitude , I went with them to the house of God , with the voice of joy and praise , with a multitude that kept holyday .
19:42:005:0	Why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted in me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance .
19:42:006:0	O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Mizar .
19:42:007:0	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me .
19:42:008:0	Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
19:42:009:0	I will say unto God my rock , Why hast thou forgotten me ? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
19:42:010:0	As with a sword in my bones , mine enemies reproach me ; while they say daily unto me , Where is thy God ?
19:42:011:0	Why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
