19:121:001:0	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help .
19:121:002:0	My help cometh from the Lord , which made heaven and earth .
19:121:003:0	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved : he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
19:121:004:0	Behold , he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep .
19:121:005:0	The Lord is thy keeper : the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
19:121:006:0	The sun shall not smite thee by day , nor the moon by night .
19:121:007:0	The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve thy soul .
19:121:008:0	The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth , and even for evermore .
