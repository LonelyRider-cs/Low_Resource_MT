19:105:001:0	O give thanks unto the Lord ; call upon his name : make known his deeds among the people .
19:105:002:0	Sing unto him , sing psalms unto him : talk ye of all his wondrous works .
19:105:003:0	Glory ye in his holy name : let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord .
19:105:004:0	Seek the Lord , and his strength : seek his face evermore .
19:105:005:0	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done ; his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ;
19:105:006:0	O ye seed of Abraham his servant , ye children of Jacob his chosen .
19:105:007:0	He is the Lord our God : his judgments are in all the earth .
19:105:008:0	He hath remembered his covenant for ever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations .
19:105:009:0	Which covenant he made with Abraham , and his oath unto Isaac ;
19:105:010:0	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant :
19:105:011:0	Saying , Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance :
19:105:012:0	When they were but a few men in number ; yea , very few , and strangers in it .
19:105:013:0	When they went from one nation to another , from one kingdom to another people ;
19:105:014:0	He suffered no man to do them wrong : yea , he reproved kings for their sakes ;
19:105:015:0	Saying , Touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm .
19:105:016:0	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land : he brake the whole staff of bread .
19:105:017:0	He sent a man before them , even Joseph , who was sold for a servant :
19:105:018:0	Whose feet they hurt with fetters : he was laid in iron :
19:105:019:0	Until the time that his word came : the word of the Lord tried him .
19:105:020:0	The king sent and loosed him ; even the ruler of the people , and let him go free .
19:105:021:0	He made him lord of his house , and ruler of all his substance :
19:105:022:0	To bind his princes at his pleasure ; and teach his senators wisdom .
19:105:023:0	Israel also came into Egypt ; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham .
19:105:024:0	And he increased his people greatly ; and made them stronger than their enemies .
19:105:025:0	He turned their heart to hate his people , to deal subtilly with his servants .
19:105:026:0	He sent Moses his servant ; and Aaron whom he had chosen .
19:105:027:0	They shewed his signs among them , and wonders in the land of Ham .
19:105:028:0	He sent darkness , and made it dark ; and they rebelled not against his word .
19:105:029:0	He turned their waters into blood , and slew their fish .
19:105:030:0	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance , in the chambers of their kings .
19:105:031:0	He spake , and there came divers sorts of flies , and lice in all their coasts .
19:105:032:0	He gave them hail for rain , and flaming fire in their land .
19:105:033:0	He smote their vines also and their fig trees ; and brake the trees of their coasts .
19:105:034:0	He spake , and the locusts came , and caterpillers , and that without number ,
19:105:035:0	And did eat up all the herbs in their land , and devoured the fruit of their ground .
19:105:036:0	He smote also all the firstborn in their land , the chief of all their strength .
19:105:037:0	He brought them forth also with silver and gold : and there was not one feeble person among their tribes .
19:105:038:0	Egypt was glad when they departed : for the fear of them fell upon them .
19:105:039:0	He spread a cloud for a covering ; and fire to give light in the night .
19:105:040:0	The people asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of heaven .
19:105:041:0	He opened the rock , and the waters gushed out ; they ran in the dry places like a river .
19:105:042:0	For he remembered his holy promise , and Abraham his servant .
19:105:043:0	And he brought forth his people with joy , and his chosen with gladness :
19:105:044:0	And gave them the lands of the heathen : and they inherited the labour of the people ;
19:105:045:0	That they might observe his statutes , and keep his laws . Praise ye the Lord .
