19:45:001:0	My heart is inditing a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made touching the king : my tongue is the pen of a ready writer .
19:45:002:0	Thou art fairer than the children of men : grace is poured into thy lips : therefore God hath blessed thee for ever .
19:45:003:0	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh , O most mighty , with thy glory and thy majesty .
19:45:004:0	And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness ; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things .
19:45:005:0	Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king 's enemies ; whereby the people fall under thee .
19:45:006:0	Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre .
19:45:007:0	Thou lovest righteousness , and hatest wickedness : therefore God , thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
19:45:008:0	All thy garments smell of myrrh , and aloes , and cassia , out of the ivory palaces , whereby they have made thee glad .
19:45:009:0	Kings ' daughters were among thy honourable women : upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir .
19:45:010:0	Hearken , O daughter , and consider , and incline thine ear ; forget also thine own people , and thy father 's house ;
19:45:011:0	So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty : for he is thy Lord ; and worship thou him .
19:45:012:0	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour .
19:45:013:0	The king 's daughter is all glorious within : her clothing is of wrought gold .
19:45:014:0	She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework : the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee .
19:45:015:0	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought : they shall enter into the king 's palace .
19:45:016:0	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children , whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth .
19:45:017:0	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations : therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever .
