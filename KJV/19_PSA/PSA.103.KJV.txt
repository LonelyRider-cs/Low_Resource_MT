19:103:001:0	Bless the , O my soul : and all that is within me , bless his holy name .
19:103:002:0	Bless the , O my soul , and forget not all his benefits :
19:103:003:0	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities ; who healeth all thy diseases ;
19:103:004:0	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction ; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies ;
19:103:005:0	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things ; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle 's .
19:103:006:0	The executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed .
19:103:007:0	He made known his ways unto Moses , his acts unto the children of Israel .
19:103:008:0	The is merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and plenteous in mercy .
19:103:009:0	He will not always chide : neither will he keep his anger for ever .
19:103:010:0	He hath not dealt with us after our sins ; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities .
19:103:011:0	For as the heaven is high above the earth , so great is his mercy toward them that fear him .
19:103:012:0	As far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us .
19:103:013:0	Like as a father pitieth his children , so the pitieth them that fear him .
19:103:014:0	For he knoweth our frame ; he remembereth that we are dust .
19:103:015:0	As for man , his days are as grass : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .
19:103:016:0	For the wind passeth over it , and it is gone ; and the place thereof shall know it no more .
19:103:017:0	But the mercy of the is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children 's children ;
19:103:018:0	To such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them .
19:103:019:0	The hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his kingdom ruleth over all .
19:103:020:0	Bless the , ye his angels , that excel in strength , that do his commandments , hearkening unto the voice of his word .
19:103:021:0	Bless ye the , all ye his hosts ; ye ministers of his , that do his pleasure .
19:103:022:0	Bless the , all his works in all places of his dominion : bless the , O my soul .
