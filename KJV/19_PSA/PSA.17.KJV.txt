19:17:001:0	Hear the right , O Lord , attend unto my cry , give ear unto my prayer , that goeth not out of feigned lips .
19:17:002:0	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence ; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal .
19:17:003:0	Thou hast proved mine heart ; thou hast visited me in the night ; thou hast tried me , and shalt find nothing ; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress .
19:17:004:0	Concerning the works of men , by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer .
19:17:005:0	Hold up my goings in thy paths , that my footsteps slip not .
19:17:006:0	I have called upon thee , for thou wilt hear me , O God : incline thine ear unto me , and hear my speech .
19:17:007:0	Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
19:17:008:0	Keep me as the apple of the eye , hide me under the shadow of thy wings ,
19:17:009:0	From the wicked that oppress me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about .
19:17:010:0	They are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
19:17:011:0	They have now compassed us in our steps : they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth ;
19:17:012:0	Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey , and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places .
19:17:013:0	Arise , O Lord , disappoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is thy sword :
19:17:014:0	From men which are thy hand , O Lord , from men of the world , which have their portion in this life , and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure : they are full of children , and leave the rest of their substance to their babes .
19:17:015:0	As for me , I will behold thy face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with thy likeness .
