19:106:001:0	Praise ye the Lord . O give thanks unto the Lord ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
19:106:002:0	Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord ? who can shew forth all his praise ?
19:106:003:0	Blessed are they that keep judgment , and he that doeth righteousness at all times .
19:106:004:0	Remember me , O Lord , with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people : O visit me with thy salvation ;
19:106:005:0	That I may see the good of thy chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation , that I may glory with thine inheritance .
19:106:006:0	We have sinned with our fathers , we have committed iniquity , we have done wickedly .
19:106:007:0	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt ; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at the Red sea .
19:106:008:0	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake , that he might make his mighty power to be known .
19:106:009:0	He rebuked the Red sea also , and it was dried up : so he led them through the depths , as through the wilderness .
19:106:010:0	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
19:106:011:0	And the waters covered their enemies : there was not one of them left .
19:106:012:0	Then believed they his words ; they sang his praise .
19:106:013:0	They soon forgat his works ; they waited not for his counsel :
19:106:014:0	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness , and tempted God in the desert .
19:106:015:0	And he gave them their request ; but sent leanness into their soul .
19:106:016:0	They envied Moses also in the camp , and Aaron the saint of the Lord .
19:106:017:0	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan , and covered the company of Abiram .
19:106:018:0	And a fire was kindled in their company ; the flame burned up the wicked .
19:106:019:0	They made a calf in Horeb , and worshipped the molten image .
19:106:020:0	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass .
19:106:021:0	They forgat God their saviour , which had done great things in Egypt ;
19:106:022:0	Wondrous works in the land of Ham , and terrible things by the Red sea .
19:106:023:0	Therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , lest he should destroy them .
19:106:024:0	Yea , they despised the pleasant land , they believed not his word :
19:106:025:0	But murmured in their tents , and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord .
19:106:026:0	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them , to overthrow them in the wilderness :
19:106:027:0	To overthrow their seed also among the nations , and to scatter them in the lands .
19:106:028:0	They joined themselves also unto Baalâ€“peor , and ate the sacrifices of the dead .
19:106:029:0	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions : and the plague brake in upon them .
19:106:030:0	Then stood up Phinehas , and executed judgment : and so the plague was stayed .
19:106:031:0	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore .
19:106:032:0	They angered him also at the waters of strife , so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes :
19:106:033:0	Because they provoked his spirit , so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips .
19:106:034:0	They did not destroy the nations , concerning whom the Lord commanded them :
19:106:035:0	But were mingled among the heathen , and learned their works .
19:106:036:0	And they served their idols : which were a snare unto them .
19:106:037:0	Yea , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils ,
19:106:038:0	And shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
19:106:039:0	Thus were they defiled with their own works , and went a whoring with their own inventions .
19:106:040:0	Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people , insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance .
19:106:041:0	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen ; and they that hated them ruled over them .
19:106:042:0	Their enemies also oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their hand .
19:106:043:0	Many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with their counsel , and were brought low for their iniquity .
19:106:044:0	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction , when he heard their cry :
19:106:045:0	And he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his mercies .
19:106:046:0	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives .
19:106:047:0	Save us , O Lord our God , and gather us from among the heathen , to give thanks unto thy holy name , and to triumph in thy praise .
19:106:048:0	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting : and let all the people say , Amen . Praise ye the Lord .
