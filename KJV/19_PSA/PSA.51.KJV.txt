19:51:001:0	Have mercy upon me , O God , according to thy lovingkindness : according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions .
19:51:002:0	Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity , and cleanse me from my sin .
19:51:003:0	For I acknowledge my transgressions : and my sin is ever before me .
19:51:004:0	Against thee , thee only , have I sinned , and done this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest , and be clear when thou judgest .
19:51:005:0	Behold , I was shapen in iniquity ; and in sin did my mother conceive me .
19:51:006:0	Behold , thou desirest truth in the inward parts : and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom .
19:51:007:0	Purge me with hyssop , and I shall be clean : wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow .
19:51:008:0	Make me to hear joy and gladness ; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice .
19:51:009:0	Hide thy face from my sins , and blot out all mine iniquities .
19:51:010:0	Create in me a clean heart , O God ; and renew a right spirit within me .
19:51:011:0	Cast me not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy spirit from me .
19:51:012:0	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation ; and uphold me with thy free spirit .
19:51:013:0	Then will I teach transgressors thy ways ; and sinners shall be converted unto thee .
19:51:014:0	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness , O God , thou God of my salvation : and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness .
19:51:015:0	O Lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise .
19:51:016:0	For thou desirest not sacrifice ; else would I give it : thou delightest not in burnt offering .
19:51:017:0	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , O God , thou wilt not despise .
19:51:018:0	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem .
19:51:019:0	Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness , with burnt offering and whole burnt offering : then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar .
