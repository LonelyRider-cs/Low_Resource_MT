19:80:001:0	Give ear , O Shepherd of Israel , thou that leadest Joseph like a flock ; thou that dwellest between the cherubims , shine forth .
19:80:002:0	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength , and come and save us .
19:80:003:0	Turn us again , O God , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
19:80:004:0	O God of hosts , how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people ?
19:80:005:0	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears ; and givest them tears to drink in great measure .
19:80:006:0	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours : and our enemies laugh among themselves .
19:80:007:0	Turn us again , O God of hosts , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
19:80:008:0	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt : thou hast cast out the heathen , and planted it .
19:80:009:0	Thou preparedst room before it , and didst cause it to take deep root , and it filled the land .
19:80:010:0	The hills were covered with the shadow of it , and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars .
19:80:011:0	She sent out her boughs unto the sea , and her branches unto the river .
19:80:012:0	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges , so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her ?
19:80:013:0	The boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of the field doth devour it .
19:80:014:0	Return , we beseech thee , O God of hosts : look down from heaven , and behold , and visit this vine ;
19:80:015:0	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted , and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself .
19:80:016:0	It is burned with fire , it is cut down : they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance .
19:80:017:0	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself .
19:80:018:0	So will not we go back from thee : quicken us , and we will call upon thy name .
19:80:019:0	Turn us again , O God of hosts , cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
