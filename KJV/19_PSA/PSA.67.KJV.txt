19:67:001:0	God be merciful unto us , and bless us ; and cause his face to shine upon us ; Selah .
19:67:002:0	That thy way may be known upon earth , thy saving health among all nations .
19:67:003:0	Let the people praise thee , O God ; let all the people praise thee .
19:67:004:0	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nations upon earth . Selah .
19:67:005:0	Let the people praise thee , O God ; let all the people praise thee .
19:67:006:0	Then shall the earth yield her increase ; and God , even our own God , shall bless us .
19:67:007:0	God shall bless us ; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him .
