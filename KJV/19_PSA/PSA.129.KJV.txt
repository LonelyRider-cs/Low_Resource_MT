19:129:001:0	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth , may Israel now say :
19:129:002:0	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth : yet they have not prevailed against me .
19:129:003:0	The plowers plowed upon my back : they made long their furrows .
19:129:004:0	The Lord is righteous : he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked .
19:129:005:0	Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion .
19:129:006:0	Let them be as the grass upon the housetops , which withereth afore it groweth up :
19:129:007:0	Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom .
19:129:008:0	Neither do they which go by say , The blessing of the Lord be upon you : we bless you in the name of the Lord .
