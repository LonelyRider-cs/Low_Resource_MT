19:27:001:0	The is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
19:27:002:0	When the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .
19:27:003:0	Though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
19:27:004:0	One thing have I desired of the , that will I seek after ; that I may dwell in the house of the all the days of my life , to behold the beauty of the , and to enquire in his temple .
19:27:005:0	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
19:27:006:0	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; I will sing , yea , I will sing praises unto the .

19:27:010:0	When my father and my mother forsake me , then the will take me up .

19:27:012:0	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
19:27:013:0	I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the goodness of the in the land of the living .
19:27:014:0	Wait on the : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen thine heart : wait , I say , on the .
