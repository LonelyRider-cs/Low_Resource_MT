19:82:001:0	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty ; he judgeth among the gods .
19:82:002:0	How long will ye judge unjustly , and accept the persons of the wicked ? Selah .
19:82:003:0	Defend the poor and fatherless : do justice to the afflicted and needy .
19:82:004:0	Deliver the poor and needy : rid them out of the hand of the wicked .
19:82:005:0	They know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
19:82:006:0	I have said , Ye are gods ; and all of you are children of the most High .
19:82:007:0	But ye shall die like men , and fall like one of the princes .
19:82:008:0	Arise , O God , judge the earth : for thou shalt inherit all nations .
