19:130:001:0	Out of the depths have I cried unto thee , O Lord .
19:130:002:0	Lord , hear my voice : let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications .
19:130:003:0	If thou , Lord , shouldest mark iniquities , O Lord , who shall stand ?
19:130:004:0	But there is forgiveness with thee , that thou mayest be feared .
19:130:005:0	I wait for the Lord , my soul doth wait , and in his word do I hope .
19:130:006:0	My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning : I say , more than they that watch for the morning .
19:130:007:0	Let Israel hope in the Lord : for with the Lord there is mercy , and with him is plenteous redemption .
19:130:008:0	And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities .
