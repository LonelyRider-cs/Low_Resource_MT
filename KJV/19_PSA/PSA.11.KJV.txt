19:11:001:0	In the put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Flee as a bird to your mountain ?
19:11:002:0	For , lo , the wicked bend their bow , they make ready their arrow upon the string , that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart .
19:11:003:0	If the foundations be destroyed , what can the righteous do ?
19:11:004:0	The is in his holy temple , the throne is in heaven : his eyes behold , his eyelids try , the children of men .
19:11:005:0	The trieth the righteous : but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth .
19:11:006:0	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares , fire and brimstone , and an horrible tempest : this shall be the portion of their cup .
19:11:007:0	For the righteous loveth righteousness ; his countenance doth behold the upright .
