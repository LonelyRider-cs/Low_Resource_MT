19:20:001:0	The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee ;
19:20:002:0	Send thee help from the sanctuary , and strengthen thee out of Zion ;
19:20:003:0	Remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ; Selah .
19:20:004:0	Grant thee according to thine own heart , and fulfil all thy counsel .
19:20:005:0	We will rejoice in thy salvation , and in the name of our God we will set up our banners : the Lord fulfil all thy petitions .
19:20:006:0	Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed ; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand .
19:20:007:0	Some trust in chariots , and some in horses : but we will remember the name of the Lord our God .
19:20:008:0	They are brought down and fallen : but we are risen , and stand upright .
19:20:009:0	Save , Lord : let the king hear us when we call .
