19:143:001:0	Hear my prayer , O , give ear to my supplications : in thy faithfulness answer me , and in thy righteousness .
19:143:002:0	And enter not into judgment with thy servant : for in thy sight shall no man living be justified .
19:143:003:0	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
19:143:004:0	Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me ; my heart within me is desolate .
19:143:005:0	I remember the days of old ; I meditate on all thy works ; I muse on the work of thy hands .
19:143:006:0	I stretch forth my hands unto thee : my soul thirsteth after thee , as a thirsty land . Selah .
19:143:007:0	Hear me speedily , O : my spirit faileth : hide not thy face from me , lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit .
19:143:008:0	Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
19:143:009:0	Deliver me , O , from mine enemies : I flee unto thee to hide me .
19:143:010:0	Teach me to do thy will ; for thou art my God : thy spirit is good ; lead me into the land of uprightness .
19:143:011:0	Quicken me , O , for thy name 's sake : for thy righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
19:143:012:0	And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies , and destroy all them that afflict my soul : for I am thy servant .
