19:18:001:0	I will love thee , O , my strength .
19:18:002:0	The is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
19:18:003:0	I will call upon the , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
19:18:004:0	The sorrows of death compassed me , and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid .
19:18:005:0	The sorrows of hell compassed me about : the snares of death prevented me .
19:18:006:0	In my distress I called upon the , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
19:18:007:0	Then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken , because he was wroth .
19:18:008:0	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
19:18:009:0	He bowed the heavens also , and came down : and darkness was under his feet .
19:18:010:0	And he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : yea , he did fly upon the wings of the wind .
19:18:011:0	He made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
19:18:012:0	At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed , hail stones and coals of fire .
19:18:013:0	The also thundered in the heavens , and the Highest gave his voice ; hail stones and coals of fire .
19:18:014:0	Yea , he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; and he shot out lightnings , and discomfited them .
19:18:015:0	Then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke , O , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils .
19:18:016:0	He sent from above , he took me , he drew me out of many waters .
19:18:017:0	He delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them which hated me : for they were too strong for me .
19:18:018:0	They prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the was my stay .
19:18:019:0	He brought me forth also into a large place ; he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
19:18:020:0	The rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
19:18:021:0	For I have kept the ways of the , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
19:18:022:0	For all his judgments were before me , and I did not put away his statutes from me .
19:18:023:0	I was also upright before him , and I kept myself from mine iniquity .
19:18:024:0	Therefore hath the recompensed me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight .
19:18:025:0	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful ; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright ;
19:18:026:0	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward .
19:18:027:0	For thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down high looks .
19:18:028:0	For thou wilt light my candle : the my God will enlighten my darkness .
19:18:029:0	For by thee I have run through a troop ; and by my God have I leaped over a wall .
19:18:030:0	As for God , his way is perfect : the word of the is tried : he is a buckler to all those that trust in him .
19:18:031:0	For who is God save the ? or who is a rock save our God ?
19:18:032:0	It is God that girdeth me with strength , and maketh my way perfect .
19:18:033:0	He maketh my feet like hinds ' feet , and setteth me upon my high places .
19:18:034:0	He teacheth my hands to war , so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
19:18:035:0	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy right hand hath holden me up , and thy gentleness hath made me great .
19:18:036:0	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me , that my feet did not slip .
19:18:037:0	I have pursued mine enemies , and overtaken them : neither did I turn again till they were consumed .
19:18:038:0	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are fallen under my feet .
19:18:039:0	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle : thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me .
19:18:040:0	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies ; that I might destroy them that hate me .
19:18:041:0	They cried , but there was none to save them : even unto the , but he answered them not .
19:18:042:0	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind : I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets .
19:18:043:0	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
19:18:044:0	As soon as they hear of me , they shall obey me : the strangers shall submit themselves unto me .
19:18:045:0	The strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
19:18:046:0	The liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and let the God of my salvation be exalted .
19:18:047:0	It is God that avengeth me , and subdueth the people under me .
19:18:048:0	He delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
19:18:049:0	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee , O , among the heathen , and sing praises unto thy name .
19:18:050:0	Great deliverance giveth he to his king ; and sheweth mercy to his anointed , to David , and to his seed for evermore .
