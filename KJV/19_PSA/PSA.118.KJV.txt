19:118:001:0	O give thanks unto the Lord ; for he is good : because his mercy endureth for ever .
19:118:002:0	Let Israel now say , that his mercy endureth for ever .
19:118:003:0	Let the house of Aaron now say , that his mercy endureth for ever .
19:118:004:0	Let them now that fear the Lord say , that his mercy endureth for ever .
19:118:005:0	I called upon the Lord in distress : the Lord answered me , and set me in a large place .
19:118:006:0	The Lord is on my side ; I will not fear : what can man do unto me ?
19:118:007:0	The Lord taketh my part with them that help me : therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me .
19:118:008:0	It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man .
19:118:009:0	It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes .
19:118:010:0	All nations compassed me about : but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them .
19:118:011:0	They compassed me about ; yea , they compassed me about : but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
19:118:012:0	They compassed me about like bees ; they are quenched as the fire of thorns : for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
19:118:013:0	Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall : but the Lord helped me .
19:118:014:0	The Lord is my strength and song , and is become my salvation .
19:118:015:0	The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous : the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly .
19:118:016:0	The right hand of the Lord is exalted : the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly .
19:118:017:0	I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the Lord .
19:118:018:0	The Lord hath chastened me sore : but he hath not given me over unto death .
19:118:019:0	Open to me the gates of righteousness : I will go into them , and I will praise the Lord :
19:118:020:0	This gate of the Lord , into which the righteous shall enter .
19:118:021:0	I will praise thee : for thou hast heard me , and art become my salvation .
19:118:022:0	The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner .
19:118:023:0	This is the Lord's doing ; it is marvellous in our eyes .
19:118:024:0	This is the day which the Lord hath made ; we will rejoice and be glad in it .
19:118:025:0	Save now , I beseech thee , O Lord : O Lord , I beseech thee , send now prosperity .
19:118:026:0	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord : we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord .
19:118:027:0	God is the Lord , which hath shewed us light : bind the sacrifice with cords , even unto the horns of the altar .
19:118:028:0	Thou art my God , and I will praise thee : thou art my God , I will exalt thee .
19:118:029:0	O give thanks unto the Lord ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
