19:5:001:0	Give ear to my words , O Lord , consider my meditation .
19:5:002:0	Hearken unto the voice of my cry , my King , and my God : for unto thee will I pray .
19:5:003:0	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
19:5:004:0	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
19:5:005:0	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
19:5:006:0	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing : the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man .
19:5:007:0	But as for me , I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy : and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple .
19:5:008:0	Lead me , O Lord , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
19:5:009:0	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth ; their inward part is very wickedness ; their throat is an open sepulchre ; they flatter with their tongue .
19:5:010:0	Destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own counsels ; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions ; for they have rebelled against thee .
19:5:011:0	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
19:5:012:0	For thou , Lord , wilt bless the righteous ; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield .
