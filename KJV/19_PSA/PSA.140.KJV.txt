19:140:001:0	Deliver me , O , from the evil man : preserve me from the violent man ;
19:140:002:0	Which imagine mischiefs in their heart ; continually are they gathered together for war .
19:140:003:0	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent ; adders ' poison is under their lips . Selah .
19:140:004:0	Keep me , O , from the hands of the wicked ; preserve me from the violent man ; who have purposed to overthrow my goings .
19:140:005:0	The proud have hid a snare for me , and cords ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gins for me . Selah .
19:140:006:0	I said unto the , Thou art my God : hear the voice of my supplications , O .
19:140:007:0	O the Lord , the strength of my salvation , thou hast covered my head in the day of battle .
19:140:008:0	Grant not , O , the desires of the wicked : further not his wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves . Selah .
19:140:009:0	As for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
19:140:010:0	Let burning coals fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep pits , that they rise not up again .
19:140:011:0	Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth : evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
19:140:012:0	I know that the will maintain the cause of the afflicted , and the right of the poor .
19:140:013:0	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name : the upright shall dwell in thy presence .
