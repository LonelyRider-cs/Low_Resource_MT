19:84:001:0	How amiable are thy tabernacles , O Lord of hosts !
19:84:002:0	My soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the Lord : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God .
19:84:003:0	Yea , the sparrow hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , O Lord of hosts , my King , and my God .
19:84:004:0	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house : they will be still praising thee . Selah .
19:84:005:0	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
19:84:006:0	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well ; the rain also filleth the pools .
19:84:007:0	They go from strength to strength , every one of them in Zion appeareth before God .
19:84:008:0	O Lord God of hosts , hear my prayer : give ear , O God of Jacob . Selah .
19:84:009:0	Behold , O God our shield , and look upon the face of thine anointed .
19:84:010:0	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
19:84:011:0	For the Lord God is a sun and shield : the Lord will give grace and glory : no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly .
19:84:012:0	O Lord of hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in thee .
