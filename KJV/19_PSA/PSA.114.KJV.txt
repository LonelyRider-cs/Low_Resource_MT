19:114:001:0	When Israel went out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a people of strange language ;
19:114:002:0	Judah was his sanctuary , and Israel his dominion .
19:114:003:0	The sea saw it , and fled : Jordan was driven back .
19:114:004:0	The mountains skipped like rams , and the little hills like lambs .
19:114:005:0	What ailed thee , O thou sea , that thou fleddest ? thou Jordan , that thou wast driven back ?
19:114:006:0	Ye mountains , that ye skipped like rams ; and ye little hills , like lambs ?
19:114:007:0	Tremble , thou earth , at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the God of Jacob ;
19:114:008:0	Which turned the rock into a standing water , the flint into a fountain of waters .
