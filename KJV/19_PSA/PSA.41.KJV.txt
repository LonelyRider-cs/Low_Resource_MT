19:41:001:0	Blessed is he that considereth the poor : the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble .
19:41:002:0	The Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies .
19:41:003:0	The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing : thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness .
19:41:004:0	I said , Lord , be merciful unto me : heal my soul ; for I have sinned against thee .
19:41:005:0	Mine enemies speak evil of me , When shall he die , and his name perish ?
19:41:006:0	And if he come to see me , he speaketh vanity : his heart gathereth iniquity to itself ; when he goeth abroad , he telleth it .
19:41:007:0	All that hate me whisper together against me : against me do they devise my hurt .
19:41:008:0	An evil disease , say they , cleaveth fast unto him : and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more .
19:41:009:0	Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me .
19:41:010:0	But thou , O Lord , be merciful unto me , and raise me up , that I may requite them .
19:41:011:0	By this I know that thou favourest me , because mine enemy doth not triumph over me .
19:41:012:0	And as for me , thou upholdest me in mine integrity , and settest me before thy face for ever .
19:41:013:0	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting , and to everlasting . Amen , and Amen .
