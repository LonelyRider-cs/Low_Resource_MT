19:31:001:0	In thee , O , do I put my trust ; let me never be ashamed : deliver me in thy righteousness .
19:31:002:0	Bow down thine ear to me ; deliver me speedily : be thou my strong rock , for an house of defence to save me .
19:31:003:0	For thou art my rock and my fortress ; therefore for thy name 's sake lead me , and guide me .
19:31:004:0	Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me : for thou art my strength .
19:31:005:0	Into thine hand I commit my spirit : thou hast redeemed me , O God of truth .
19:31:006:0	I have hated them that regard lying vanities : but I trust in the .
19:31:007:0	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy : for thou hast considered my trouble ; thou hast known my soul in adversities ;
19:31:008:0	And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast set my feet in a large room .
19:31:009:0	Have mercy upon me , O , for I am in trouble : mine eye is consumed with grief , yea , my soul and my belly .
19:31:010:0	For my life is spent with grief , and my years with sighing : my strength faileth because of mine iniquity , and my bones are consumed .
19:31:011:0	I was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
19:31:012:0	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind : I am like a broken vessel .
19:31:013:0	For I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
19:31:014:0	But I trusted in thee , O : I said , Thou art my God .
19:31:015:0	My times are in thy hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enemies , and from them that persecute me .
19:31:016:0	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant : save me for thy mercies ' sake .
19:31:017:0	Let me not be ashamed , O ; for I have called upon thee : let the wicked be ashamed , and let them be silent in the grave .
19:31:018:0	Let the lying lips be put to silence ; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous .
19:31:019:0	Oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
19:31:020:0	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
19:31:021:0	Blessed be the : for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city .
19:31:022:0	For I said in my haste , I am cut off from before thine eyes : nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee .
19:31:023:0	O love the , all ye his saints : for the preserveth the faithful , and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer .
19:31:024:0	Be of good courage , and he shall strengthen your heart , all ye that hope in the .
