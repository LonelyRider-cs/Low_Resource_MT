19:47:001:0	O clap your hands , all ye people ; shout unto God with the voice of triumph .
19:47:002:0	For the most high is terrible ; he is a great King over all the earth .
19:47:003:0	He shall subdue the people under us , and the nations under our feet .
19:47:004:0	He shall choose our inheritance for us , the excellency of Jacob whom he loved . Selah .
19:47:005:0	God is gone up with a shout , the with the sound of a trumpet .
19:47:006:0	Sing praises to God , sing praises : sing praises unto our King , sing praises .
19:47:007:0	For God is the King of all the earth : sing ye praises with understanding .
19:47:008:0	God reigneth over the heathen : God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness .
19:47:009:0	The princes of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Abraham : for the shields of the earth belong unto God : he is greatly exalted .
