19:37:001:0	Fret not thyself because of evildoers , neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity .
19:37:002:0	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither as the green herb .
19:37:003:0	Trust in the Lord , and do good ; so shalt thou dwell in the land , and verily thou shalt be fed .
19:37:004:0	Delight thyself also in the Lord ; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart .
19:37:005:0	Commit thy way unto the Lord ; trust also in him ; and he shall bring it to pass .
19:37:006:0	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light , and thy judgment as the noonday .
19:37:007:0	Rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for him : fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way , because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass .
19:37:008:0	Cease from anger , and forsake wrath : fret not thyself in any wise to do evil .
19:37:009:0	For evildoers shall be cut off : but those that wait upon the Lord , they shall inherit the earth .
19:37:010:0	For yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
19:37:011:0	But the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace .
19:37:012:0	The wicked plotteth against the just , and gnasheth upon him with his teeth .
19:37:013:0	The Lord shall laugh at him : for he seeth that his day is coming .
19:37:014:0	The wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
19:37:015:0	Their sword shall enter into their own heart , and their bows shall be broken .
19:37:016:0	A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked .
19:37:017:0	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken : but the Lord upholdeth the righteous .
19:37:018:0	The Lord knoweth the days of the upright : and their inheritance shall be for ever .
19:37:019:0	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time : and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
19:37:020:0	But the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
19:37:021:0	The wicked borroweth , and payeth not again : but the righteous sheweth mercy , and giveth .
19:37:022:0	For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off .
19:37:023:0	The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord : and he delighteth in his way .
19:37:024:0	Though he fall , he shall not be utterly cast down : for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand .
19:37:025:0	I have been young , and now am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread .
19:37:026:0	He is ever merciful , and lendeth ; and his seed is blessed .
19:37:027:0	Depart from evil , and do good ; and dwell for evermore .
19:37:028:0	For the Lord loveth judgment , and forsaketh not his saints ; they are preserved for ever : but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off .
19:37:029:0	The righteous shall inherit the land , and dwell therein for ever .
19:37:030:0	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom , and his tongue talketh of judgment .
19:37:031:0	The law of his God is in his heart ; none of his steps shall slide .
19:37:032:0	The wicked watcheth the righteous , and seeketh to slay him .
19:37:033:0	The Lord will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
19:37:034:0	Wait on the Lord , and keep his way , and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land : when the wicked are cut off , thou shalt see it .
19:37:035:0	I have seen the wicked in great power , and spreading himself like a green bay tree .
19:37:036:0	Yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : yea , I sought him , but he could not be found .
19:37:037:0	Mark the perfect man , and behold the upright : for the end of that man is peace .
19:37:038:0	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together : the end of the wicked shall be cut off .
19:37:039:0	But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord : he is their strength in the time of trouble .
19:37:040:0	And the Lord shall help them , and deliver them : he shall deliver them from the wicked , and save them , because they trust in him .
