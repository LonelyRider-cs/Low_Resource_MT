19:68:001:0	Let God arise , let his enemies be scattered : let them also that hate him flee before him .
19:68:002:0	As smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
19:68:003:0	But let the righteous be glad ; let them rejoice before God : yea , let them exceedingly rejoice .
19:68:004:0	Sing unto God , sing praises to his name : extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name , and rejoice before him .
19:68:005:0	A father of the fatherless , and a judge of the widows , is God in his holy habitation .
19:68:006:0	God setteth the solitary in families : he bringeth out those which are bound with chains : but the rebellious dwell in a dry land .
19:68:007:0	O God , when thou wentest forth before thy people , when thou didst march through the wilderness ; Selah :
19:68:008:0	The earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
19:68:009:0	Thou , O God , didst send a plentiful rain , whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance , when it was weary .
19:68:010:0	Thy congregation hath dwelt therein : thou , O God , hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor .
19:68:011:0	The Lord gave the word : great was the company of those that published it .
19:68:012:0	Kings of armies did flee apace : and she that tarried at home divided the spoil .
19:68:013:0	Though ye have lien among the pots , yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver , and her feathers with yellow gold .
19:68:014:0	When the Almighty scattered kings in it , it was white as snow in Zalmon .
19:68:015:0	The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan ; an high hill as the hill of Bashan .
19:68:016:0	Why leap ye , ye high hills ? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in ; yea , the will dwell in it for ever .
19:68:017:0	The chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
19:68:018:0	Thou hast ascended on high , thou hast led captivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the God might dwell among them .
19:68:019:0	Blessed be the Lord , who daily loadeth us with benefits , even the God of our salvation . Selah .
19:68:020:0	He that is our God is the God of salvation ; and unto the Lord belong the issues from death .
19:68:021:0	But God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
19:68:022:0	The Lord said , I will bring again from Bashan , I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea :
19:68:023:0	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies , and the tongue of thy dogs in the same .
19:68:024:0	They have seen thy goings , O God ; even the goings of my God , my King , in the sanctuary .
19:68:025:0	The singers went before , the players on instruments followed after ; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels .
19:68:026:0	Bless ye God in the congregations , even the Lord , from the fountain of Israel .
19:68:027:0	There is little Benjamin with their ruler , the princes of Judah and their council , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali .
19:68:028:0	Thy God hath commanded thy strength : strengthen , O God , that which thou hast wrought for us .
19:68:029:0	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee .
19:68:030:0	Rebuke the company of spearmen , the multitude of the bulls , with the calves of the people , till every one submit himself with pieces of silver : scatter thou the people that delight in war .
19:68:031:0	Princes shall come out of Egypt ; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God .
19:68:032:0	Sing unto God , ye kingdoms of the earth ; O sing praises unto the Lord ; Selah :
19:68:033:0	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
19:68:034:0	Ascribe ye strength unto God : his excellency is over Israel , and his strength is in the clouds .
19:68:035:0	O God , thou art terrible out of thy holy places : the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people . Blessed be God .
