19:95:001:0	O come , let us sing unto the Lord : let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation .
19:95:002:0	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms .
19:95:003:0	For the Lord is a great God , and a great King above all gods .
19:95:004:0	In his hand are the deep places of the earth : the strength of the hills is his also .
19:95:005:0	The sea is his , and he made it : and his hands formed the dry land .
19:95:006:0	O come , let us worship and bow down : let us kneel before the Lord our maker .
19:95:007:0	For he is our God ; and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand . To day if ye will hear his voice ,
19:95:008:0	Harden not your heart , as in the provocation , and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
19:95:009:0	When your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my work .
19:95:010:0	Forty years long was I grieved with this generation , and said , It is a people that do err in their heart , and they have not known my ways :
19:95:011:0	Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest .
