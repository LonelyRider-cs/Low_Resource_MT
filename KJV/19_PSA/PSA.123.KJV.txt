19:123:001:0	Unto thee lift I up mine eyes , O thou that dwellest in the heavens .
19:123:002:0	Behold , as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters , and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God , until that he have mercy upon us .
19:123:003:0	Have mercy upon us , O Lord , have mercy upon us : for we are exceedingly filled with contempt .
19:123:004:0	Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
