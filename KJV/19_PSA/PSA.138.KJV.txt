19:138:001:0	I will praise thee with my whole heart : before the gods will I sing praise unto thee .
19:138:002:0	I will worship toward thy holy temple , and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth : for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name .
19:138:003:0	In the day when I cried thou answeredst me , and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul .
19:138:004:0	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee , O Lord , when they hear the words of thy mouth .
19:138:005:0	Yea , they shall sing in the ways of the Lord : for great is the glory of the Lord .
19:138:006:0	Though the Lord be high , yet hath he respect unto the lowly : but the proud he knoweth afar off .
19:138:007:0	Though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and thy right hand shall save me .
19:138:008:0	The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , O Lord , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
