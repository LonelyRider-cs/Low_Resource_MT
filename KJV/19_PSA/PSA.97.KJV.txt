19:97:001:0	The Lord reigneth ; let the earth rejoice ; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof .
19:97:002:0	Clouds and darkness are round about him : righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne .
19:97:003:0	A fire goeth before him , and burneth up his enemies round about .
19:97:004:0	His lightnings enlightened the world : the earth saw , and trembled .
19:97:005:0	The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth .
19:97:006:0	The heavens declare his righteousness , and all the people see his glory .
19:97:007:0	Confounded be all they that serve graven images , that boast themselves of idols : worship him , all ye gods .
19:97:008:0	Zion heard , and was glad ; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments , O Lord .
19:97:009:0	For thou , Lord , art high above all the earth : thou art exalted far above all gods .
19:97:010:0	Ye that love the Lord , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
19:97:011:0	Light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
19:97:012:0	Rejoice in the Lord , ye righteous ; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness .
