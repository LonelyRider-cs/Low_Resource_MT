19:127:001:0	Except the Lord build the house , they labour in vain that build it : except the Lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain .
19:127:002:0	It is vain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrows : for so he giveth his beloved sleep .
19:127:003:0	Lo , children are an heritage of the Lord : and the fruit of the womb is his reward .
19:127:004:0	As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man ; so are children of the youth .
19:127:005:0	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate .
