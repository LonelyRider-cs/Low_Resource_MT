19:48:001:0	Great is the , and greatly to be praised in the city of our God , in the mountain of his holiness .
19:48:002:0	Beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount Zion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
19:48:003:0	God is known in her palaces for a refuge .
19:48:004:0	For , lo , the kings were assembled , they passed by together .
19:48:005:0	They saw it , and so they marvelled ; they were troubled , and hasted away .
19:48:006:0	Fear took hold upon them there , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
19:48:007:0	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind .
19:48:008:0	As we have heard , so have we seen in the city of the of hosts , in the city of our God : God will establish it for ever . Selah .
19:48:009:0	We have thought of thy lovingkindness , O God , in the midst of thy temple .
19:48:010:0	According to thy name , O God , so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth : thy right hand is full of righteousness .
19:48:011:0	Let mount Zion rejoice , let the daughters of Judah be glad , because of thy judgments .
19:48:012:0	Walk about Zion , and go round about her : tell the towers thereof .
19:48:013:0	Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following .
19:48:014:0	For this God is our God for ever and ever : he will be our guide even unto death .
