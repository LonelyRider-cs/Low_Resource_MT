19:26:001:0	Judge me , O Lord ; for I have walked in mine integrity : I have trusted also in the Lord ; therefore I shall not slide .
19:26:002:0	Examine me , O Lord , and prove me ; try my reins and my heart .
19:26:003:0	For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes : and I have walked in thy truth .
19:26:004:0	I have not sat with vain persons , neither will I go in with dissemblers .
19:26:005:0	I have hated the congregation of evil doers ; and will not sit with the wicked .
19:26:006:0	I will wash mine hands in innocency : so will I compass thine altar , O Lord :
19:26:007:0	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving , and tell of all thy wondrous works .
19:26:008:0	Lord , I have loved the habitation of thy house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth .
19:26:009:0	Gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men :
19:26:010:0	In whose hands is mischief , and their right hand is full of bribes .
19:26:011:0	But as for me , I will walk in mine integrity : redeem me , and be merciful unto me .
19:26:012:0	My foot standeth in an even place : in the congregations will I bless the Lord .
