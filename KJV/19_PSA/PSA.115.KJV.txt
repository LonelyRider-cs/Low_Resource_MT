19:115:001:0	Not unto us , O Lord , not unto us , but unto thy name give glory , for thy mercy , and for thy truth's sake .
19:115:002:0	Wherefore should the heathen say , Where is now their God ?
19:115:003:0	But our God is in the heavens : he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased .
19:115:004:0	Their idols are silver and gold , the work of men's hands .
19:115:005:0	They have mouths , but they speak not : eyes have they , but they see not :
19:115:006:0	They have ears , but they hear not : noses have they , but they smell not :
19:115:007:0	They have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their throat .
19:115:008:0	They that make them are like unto them ; so is every one that trusteth in them .
19:115:009:0	O Israel , trust thou in the Lord : he is their help and their shield .
19:115:010:0	O house of Aaron , trust in the Lord : he is their help and their shield .
19:115:011:0	Ye that fear the Lord , trust in the Lord : he is their help and their shield .
19:115:012:0	The Lord hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron .
19:115:013:0	He will bless them that fear the Lord , both small and great .
19:115:014:0	The Lord shall increase you more and more , you and your children .
19:115:015:0	Ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth .
19:115:016:0	The heaven , even the heavens , are the Lord's : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
19:115:017:0	The dead praise not the Lord , neither any that go down into silence .
19:115:018:0	But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore . Praise the Lord .
