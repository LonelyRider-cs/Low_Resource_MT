19:2:001:0	Why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vain thing ?
19:2:002:0	The kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the Lord , and against his anointed , saying ,
19:2:003:0	Let us break their bands asunder , and cast away their cords from us .
19:2:004:0	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh : the Lord shall have them in derision .
19:2:005:0	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath , and vex them in his sore displeasure .
19:2:006:0	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion .
19:2:007:0	I will declare the decree : the Lord hath said unto me , Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee .
19:2:008:0	Ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession .
19:2:009:0	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel .
19:2:010:0	Be wise now therefore , O ye kings : be instructed , ye judges of the earth .
19:2:011:0	Serve the Lord with fear , and rejoice with trembling .
19:2:012:0	Kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . Blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
