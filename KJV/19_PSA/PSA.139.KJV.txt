19:139:001:0	O , thou hast searched me , and known me .
19:139:002:0	Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .
19:139:003:0	Thou compassest my path and my lying down , and art acquainted with all my ways .
19:139:004:0	For there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O , thou knowest it altogether .
19:139:005:0	Thou hast beset me behind and before , and laid thine hand upon me .
19:139:006:0	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me ; it is high , I can not attain unto it .
19:139:007:0	Whither shall I go from thy spirit ? or whither shall I flee from thy presence ?
19:139:008:0	If I ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if I make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
19:139:009:0	If I take the wings of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
19:139:010:0	Even there shall thy hand lead me , and thy right hand shall hold me .
19:139:011:0	If I say , Surely the darkness shall cover me ; even the night shall be light about me .
19:139:012:0	Yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee .
19:139:013:0	For thou hast possessed my reins : thou hast covered me in my mother 's womb .
19:139:014:0	I will praise thee ; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made : marvellous are thy works ; and that my soul knoweth right well .
19:139:015:0	My substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
19:139:016:0	Thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in thy book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
19:139:017:0	How precious also are thy thoughts unto me , O God ! how great is the sum of them !
19:139:018:0	If I should count them , they are more in number than the sand : when I awake , I am still with thee .
19:139:019:0	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked , O God : depart from me therefore , ye bloody men .
19:139:020:0	For they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain .
19:139:021:0	Do not I hate them , O , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
19:139:022:0	I hate them with perfect hatred : I count them mine enemies .
19:139:023:0	Search me , O God , and know my heart : try me , and know my thoughts :
19:139:024:0	And see if there be any wicked way in me , and lead me in the way everlasting .
