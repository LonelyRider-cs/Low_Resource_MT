19:72:001:0	Give the king thy judgments , O God , and thy righteousness unto the king's son .
19:72:002:0	He shall judge thy people with righteousness , and thy poor with judgment .
19:72:003:0	The mountains shall bring peace to the people , and the little hills , by righteousness .
19:72:004:0	He shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
19:72:005:0	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure , throughout all generations .
19:72:006:0	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass : as showers that water the earth .
19:72:007:0	In his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth .
19:72:008:0	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth .
19:72:009:0	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him ; and his enemies shall lick the dust .
19:72:010:0	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents : the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts .
19:72:011:0	Yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations shall serve him .
19:72:012:0	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also , and him that hath no helper .
19:72:013:0	He shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy .
19:72:014:0	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence : and precious shall their blood be in his sight .
19:72:015:0	And he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba : prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall he be praised .
19:72:016:0	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
19:72:017:0	His name shall endure for ever : his name shall be continued as long as the sun : and men shall be blessed in him : all nations shall call him blessed .
19:72:018:0	Blessed be the Lord God , the God of Israel , who only doeth wondrous things .
19:72:019:0	And blessed be his glorious name for ever : and let the whole earth be filled with his glory ; Amen , and Amen .
19:72:020:0	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended .
