19:38:001:0	O Lord , rebuke me not in thy wrath : neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure .
19:38:002:0	For thine arrows stick fast in me , and thy hand presseth me sore .
19:38:003:0	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
19:38:004:0	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head : as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me .
19:38:005:0	My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness .
19:38:006:0	I am troubled ; I am bowed down greatly ; I go mourning all the day long .
19:38:007:0	For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease : and there is no soundness in my flesh .
19:38:008:0	I am feeble and sore broken : I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart .
19:38:009:0	Lord , all my desire is before thee ; and my groaning is not hid from thee .
19:38:010:0	My heart panteth , my strength faileth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
19:38:011:0	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore ; and my kinsmen stand afar off .
19:38:012:0	They also that seek after my life lay snares for me : and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and imagine deceits all the day long .
19:38:013:0	But I , as a deaf man , heard not ; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth .
19:38:014:0	Thus I was as a man that heareth not , and in whose mouth are no reproofs .
19:38:015:0	For in thee , O Lord , do I hope : thou wilt hear , O Lord my God .
19:38:016:0	For I said , Hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me .
19:38:017:0	For I am ready to halt , and my sorrow is continually before me .
19:38:018:0	For I will declare mine iniquity ; I will be sorry for my sin .
19:38:019:0	But mine enemies are lively , and they are strong : and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied .
19:38:020:0	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries ; because I follow the thing that good is .
19:38:021:0	Forsake me not , O Lord : O my God , be not far from me .
19:38:022:0	Make haste to help me , O Lord my salvation .
