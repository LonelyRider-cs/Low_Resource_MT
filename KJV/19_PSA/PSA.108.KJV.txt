19:108:001:0	O God , my heart is fixed ; I will sing and give praise , even with my glory .
19:108:002:0	Awake , psaltery and harp : I myself will awake early .
19:108:003:0	I will praise thee , O , among the people : and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations .
19:108:004:0	For thy mercy is great above the heavens : and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds .
19:108:005:0	Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens : and thy glory above all the earth ;
19:108:006:0	That thy beloved may be delivered : save with thy right hand , and answer me .
19:108:007:0	God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth .
19:108:008:0	Gilead is mine ; Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
19:108:009:0	Moab is my washpot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe ; over Philistia will I triumph .
19:108:010:0	Who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into Edom ?
19:108:011:0	Wilt not thou , O God , who hast cast us off ? and wilt not thou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
19:108:012:0	Give us help from trouble : for vain is the help of man .
19:108:013:0	Through God we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
