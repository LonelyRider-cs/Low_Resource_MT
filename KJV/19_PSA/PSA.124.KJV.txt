19:124:001:0	If it had not been the Lord who was on our side , now may Israel say ;
19:124:002:0	If it had not been the Lord who was on our side , when men rose up against us :
19:124:003:0	Then they had swallowed us up quick , when their wrath was kindled against us :
19:124:004:0	Then the waters had overwhelmed us , the stream had gone over our soul :
19:124:005:0	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul .
19:124:006:0	Blessed be the Lord , who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth .
19:124:007:0	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers : the snare is broken , and we are escaped .
19:124:008:0	Our help is in the name of the Lord , who made heaven and earth .
