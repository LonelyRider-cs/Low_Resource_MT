19:9:001:0	I will praise thee , O , with my whole heart ; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works .
19:9:002:0	I will be glad and rejoice in thee : I will sing praise to thy name , O thou most High .
19:9:003:0	When mine enemies are turned back , they shall fall and perish at thy presence .
19:9:004:0	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause ; thou satest in the throne judging right .
19:9:005:0	Thou hast rebuked the heathen , thou hast destroyed the wicked , thou hast put out their name for ever and ever .
19:9:006:0	O thou enemy , destructions are come to a perpetual end : and thou hast destroyed cities ; their memorial is perished with them .
19:9:007:0	But the shall endure for ever : he hath prepared his throne for judgment .
19:9:008:0	And he shall judge the world in righteousness , he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness .
19:9:009:0	The also will be a refuge for the oppressed , a refuge in times of trouble .
19:9:010:0	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
19:9:011:0	Sing praises to the , which dwelleth in Zion : declare among the people his doings .
19:9:012:0	When he maketh inquisition for blood , he remembereth them : he forgetteth not the cry of the humble .
19:9:013:0	Have mercy upon me , O ; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me , thou that liftest me up from the gates of death :
19:9:014:0	That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion : I will rejoice in thy salvation .
19:9:015:0	The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken .
19:9:016:0	The is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . Higgaion . Selah .
19:9:017:0	The wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God .
19:9:018:0	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten : the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever .
19:9:019:0	Arise , O ; let not man prevail : let the heathen be judged in thy sight .
19:9:020:0	Put them in fear , O : that the nations may know themselves to be but men . Selah .
