19:16:001:0	Preserve me , O God : for in thee do I put my trust .
19:16:002:0	O my soul , thou hast said unto the Lord , Thou art my Lord : my goodness extendeth not to thee ;
19:16:003:0	But to the saints that are in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom is all my delight .
19:16:004:0	Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god : their drink offerings of blood will I not offer , nor take up their names into my lips .
19:16:005:0	The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup : thou maintainest my lot .
19:16:006:0	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea , I have a goodly heritage .
19:16:007:0	I will bless the Lord , who hath given me counsel : my reins also instruct me in the night seasons .
19:16:008:0	I have set the Lord always before me : because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
19:16:009:0	Therefore my heart is glad , and my glory rejoiceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
19:16:010:0	For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell ; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
19:16:011:0	Thou wilt shew me the path of life : in thy presence is fulness of joy ; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore .
