19:76:001:0	In Judah is God known : his name is great in Israel .
19:76:002:0	In Salem also is his tabernacle , and his dwelling place in Zion .
19:76:003:0	There brake he the arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the battle . Selah .
19:76:004:0	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey .
19:76:005:0	The stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
19:76:006:0	At thy rebuke , O God of Jacob , both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep .
19:76:007:0	Thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry ?
19:76:008:0	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven ; the earth feared , and was still ,
19:76:009:0	When God arose to judgment , to save all the meek of the earth . Selah .
19:76:010:0	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee : the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain .
19:76:011:0	Vow , and pay unto the your God : let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared .
19:76:012:0	He shall cut off the spirit of princes : he is terrible to the kings of the earth .
