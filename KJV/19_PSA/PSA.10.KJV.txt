19:10:001:0	Why standest thou afar off , O ? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble ?
19:10:002:0	The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined .
19:10:003:0	For the wicked boasteth of his heart 's desire , and blesseth the covetous , whom the abhorreth .
19:10:004:0	The wicked , through the pride of his countenance , will not seek after God : God is not in all his thoughts .
19:10:005:0	His ways are always grievous ; thy judgments are far above out of his sight : as for all his enemies , he puffeth at them .
19:10:006:0	He hath said in his heart , I shall not be moved : for I shall never be in adversity .
19:10:007:0	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud : under his tongue is mischief and vanity .
19:10:008:0	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doth he murder the innocent : his eyes are privily set against the poor .
19:10:009:0	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
19:10:010:0	He croucheth , and humbleth himself , that the poor may fall by his strong ones .
19:10:011:0	He hath said in his heart , God hath forgotten : he hideth his face ; he will never see it .
19:10:012:0	Arise , O ; O God , lift up thine hand : forget not the humble .
19:10:013:0	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God ? he hath said in his heart , Thou wilt not require it .
19:10:014:0	Thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with thy hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
19:10:015:0	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man : seek out his wickedness till thou find none .
19:10:016:0	The is King for ever and ever : the heathen are perished out of his land .
19:10:017:0	, thou hast heard the desire of the humble : thou wilt prepare their heart , thou wilt cause thine ear to hear :
19:10:018:0	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that the man of the earth may no more oppress .
