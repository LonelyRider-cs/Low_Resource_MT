19:85:001:0	Lord , thou hast been favourable unto thy land : thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob .
19:85:002:0	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people , thou hast covered all their sin . Selah .
19:85:003:0	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath : thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger .
19:85:004:0	Turn us , O God of our salvation , and cause thine anger toward us to cease .
19:85:005:0	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever ? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations ?
19:85:006:0	Wilt thou not revive us again : that thy people may rejoice in thee ?
19:85:007:0	Shew us thy mercy , O Lord , and grant us thy salvation .
19:85:008:0	I will hear what God the Lord will speak : for he will speak peace unto his people , and to his saints : but let them not turn again to folly .
19:85:009:0	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him ; that glory may dwell in our land .
19:85:010:0	Mercy and truth are met together ; righteousness and peace have kissed each other .
19:85:011:0	Truth shall spring out of the earth ; and righteousness shall look down from heaven .
19:85:012:0	Yea , the Lord shall give that which is good ; and our land shall yield her increase .
19:85:013:0	Righteousness shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way of his steps .
