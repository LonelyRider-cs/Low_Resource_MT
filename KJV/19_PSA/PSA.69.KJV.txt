19:69:001:0	Save me , O God ; for the waters are come in unto my soul .
19:69:002:0	I sink in deep mire , where there is no standing : I am come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
19:69:003:0	I am weary of my crying : my throat is dried : mine eyes fail while I wait for my God .
19:69:004:0	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are mighty : then I restored that which I took not away .
19:69:005:0	O God , thou knowest my foolishness ; and my sins are not hid from thee .
19:69:006:0	Let not them that wait on thee , O Lord of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
19:69:007:0	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach ; shame hath covered my face .
19:69:008:0	I am become a stranger unto my brethren , and an alien unto my mother 's children .
19:69:009:0	For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me .
19:69:010:0	When I wept , and chastened my soul with fasting , that was to my reproach .
19:69:011:0	I made sackcloth also my garment ; and I became a proverb to them .
19:69:012:0	They that sit in the gate speak against me ; and I was the song of the drunkards .
19:69:013:0	But as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation .
19:69:014:0	Deliver me out of the mire , and let me not sink : let me be delivered from them that hate me , and out of the deep waters .
19:69:015:0	Let not the waterflood overflow me , neither let the deep swallow me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me .
19:69:016:0	Hear me , O ; for thy lovingkindness is good : turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies .
19:69:017:0	And hide not thy face from thy servant ; for I am in trouble : hear me speedily .
19:69:018:0	Draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of mine enemies .
19:69:019:0	Thou hast known my reproach , and my shame , and my dishonour : mine adversaries are all before thee .
19:69:020:0	Reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
19:69:021:0	They gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink .
19:69:022:0	Let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
19:69:023:0	Let their eyes be darkened , that they see not ; and make their loins continually to shake .
19:69:024:0	Pour out thine indignation upon them , and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them .
19:69:025:0	Let their habitation be desolate ; and let none dwell in their tents .
19:69:026:0	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten ; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded .
19:69:027:0	Add iniquity unto their iniquity : and let them not come into thy righteousness .
19:69:028:0	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living , and not be written with the righteous .
19:69:029:0	But I am poor and sorrowful : let thy salvation , O God , set me up on high .
19:69:030:0	I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him with thanksgiving .
19:69:031:0	This also shall please the better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs .
19:69:032:0	The humble shall see this , and be glad : and your heart shall live that seek God .
19:69:033:0	For the heareth the poor , and despiseth not his prisoners .
19:69:034:0	Let the heaven and earth praise him , the seas , and every thing that moveth therein .
19:69:035:0	For God will save Zion , and will build the cities of Judah : that they may dwell there , and have it in possession .
19:69:036:0	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it : and they that love his name shall dwell therein .
