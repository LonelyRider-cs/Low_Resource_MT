19:54:001:0	Save me , O God , by thy name , and judge me by thy strength .
19:54:002:0	Hear my prayer , O God ; give ear to the words of my mouth .
19:54:003:0	For strangers are risen up against me , and oppressors seek after my soul : they have not set God before them . Selah .
19:54:004:0	Behold , God is mine helper : the Lord is with them that uphold my soul .
19:54:005:0	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies : cut them off in thy truth .
19:54:006:0	I will freely sacrifice unto thee : I will praise thy name , O ; for it is good .
19:54:007:0	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble : and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies .
