19:93:001:0	The Lord reigneth , he is clothed with majesty ; the Lord is clothed with strength , wherewith he hath girded himself : the world also is stablished , that it cannot be moved .
19:93:002:0	Thy throne is established of old : thou art from everlasting .
19:93:003:0	The floods have lifted up , O Lord , the floods have lifted up their voice ; the floods lift up their waves .
19:93:004:0	The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters , yea , than the mighty waves of the sea .
19:93:005:0	Thy testimonies are very sure : holiness becometh thine house , O Lord , for ever .
