19:34:001:0	I will bless the at all times : his praise shall continually be in my mouth .
19:34:002:0	My soul shall make her boast in the : the humble shall hear thereof , and be glad .
19:34:003:0	O magnify the with me , and let us exalt his name together .
19:34:004:0	I sought the , and he heard me , and delivered me from all my fears .
19:34:005:0	They looked unto him , and were lightened : and their faces were not ashamed .
19:34:006:0	This poor man cried , and the heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles .
19:34:007:0	The angel of the encampeth round about them that fear him , and delivereth them .
19:34:008:0	O taste and see that the is good : blessed is the man that trusteth in him .
19:34:009:0	O fear the , ye his saints : for there is no want to them that fear him .
19:34:010:0	The young lions do lack , and suffer hunger : but they that seek the shall not want any good thing .
19:34:011:0	Come , ye children , hearken unto me : I will teach you the fear of the .
19:34:012:0	What man is he that desireth life , and loveth many days , that he may see good ?
19:34:013:0	Keep thy tongue from evil , and thy lips from speaking guile .
19:34:014:0	Depart from evil , and do good ; seek peace , and pursue it .
19:34:015:0	The eyes of the are upon the righteous , and his ears are open unto their cry .
19:34:016:0	The face of the is against them that do evil , to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth .
19:34:017:0	The righteous cry , and the heareth , and delivereth them out of all their troubles .
19:34:018:0	The is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart ; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit .
19:34:019:0	Many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the delivereth him out of them all .
19:34:020:0	He keepeth all his bones : not one of them is broken .
19:34:021:0	Evil shall slay the wicked : and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate .
19:34:022:0	The redeemeth the soul of his servants : and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate .
