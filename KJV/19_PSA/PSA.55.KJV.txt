19:55:001:0	Give ear to my prayer , O God ; and hide not thyself from my supplication .
19:55:002:0	Attend unto me , and hear me : I mourn in my complaint , and make a noise ;
19:55:003:0	Because of the voice of the enemy , because of the oppression of the wicked : for they cast iniquity upon me , and in wrath they hate me .
19:55:004:0	My heart is sore pained within me : and the terrors of death are fallen upon me .
19:55:005:0	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me , and horror hath overwhelmed me .
19:55:006:0	And I said , Oh that I had wings like a dove ! for then would I fly away , and be at rest .
19:55:007:0	Lo , then would I wander far off , and remain in the wilderness . Selah .
19:55:008:0	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest .
19:55:009:0	Destroy , O Lord , and divide their tongues : for I have seen violence and strife in the city .
19:55:010:0	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof : mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it .
19:55:011:0	Wickedness is in the midst thereof : deceit and guile depart not from her streets .
19:55:012:0	For it was not an enemy that reproached me ; then I could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me ; then I would have hid myself from him :
19:55:013:0	But it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
19:55:014:0	We took sweet counsel together , and walked unto the house of God in company .
19:55:015:0	Let death seize upon them , and let them go down quick into hell : for wickedness is in their dwellings , and among them .
19:55:016:0	As for me , I will call upon God ; and the shall save me .
19:55:017:0	Evening , and morning , and at noon , will I pray , and cry aloud : and he shall hear my voice .
19:55:018:0	He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me : for there were many with me .
19:55:019:0	God shall hear , and afflict them , even he that abideth of old . Selah . Because they have no changes , therefore they fear not God .
19:55:020:0	He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hath broken his covenant .
19:55:021:0	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter , but war was in his heart : his words were softer than oil , yet were they drawn swords .
19:55:022:0	Cast thy burden upon the , and he shall sustain thee : he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved .
19:55:023:0	But thou , O God , shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction : bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days ; but I will trust in thee .
