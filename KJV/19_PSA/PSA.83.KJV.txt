19:83:001:0	Keep not thou silence , O God : hold not thy peace , and be not still , O God .
19:83:002:0	For , lo , thine enemies make a tumult : and they that hate thee have lifted up the head .
19:83:003:0	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people , and consulted against thy hidden ones .
19:83:004:0	They have said , Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance .
19:83:005:0	For they have consulted together with one consent : they are confederate against thee :
19:83:006:0	The tabernacles of Edom , and the Ishmaelites ; of Moab , and the Hagarites ;
19:83:007:0	Gebal , and Ammon , and Amalek ; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre ;
19:83:008:0	Assur also is joined with them : they have holpen the children of Lot . Selah .
19:83:009:0	Do unto them as unto the Midianites ; as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the brook of Kishon :
19:83:010:0	Which perished at Endor : they became as dung for the earth .
19:83:011:0	Make their nobles like Oreb , and like Zeeb : yea , all their princes as Zebah , and as Zalmunna :
19:83:012:0	Who said , Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession .
19:83:013:0	O my God , make them like a wheel ; as the stubble before the wind .
19:83:014:0	As the fire burneth a wood , and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire ;
19:83:015:0	So persecute them with thy tempest , and make them afraid with thy storm .
19:83:016:0	Fill their faces with shame ; that they may seek thy name , O .
19:83:017:0	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever ; yea , let them be put to shame , and perish :
19:83:018:0	That men may know that thou , whose name alone is , art the most high over all the earth .
