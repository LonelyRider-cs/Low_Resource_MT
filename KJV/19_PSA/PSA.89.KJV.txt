19:89:001:0	I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever : with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations .
19:89:002:0	For I have said , Mercy shall be built up for ever : thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens .
19:89:003:0	I have made a covenant with my chosen , I have sworn unto David my servant ,
19:89:004:0	Thy seed will I establish for ever , and build up thy throne to all generations . Selah .
19:89:005:0	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders , O Lord : thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints .
19:89:006:0	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord ? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord ?
19:89:007:0	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him .
19:89:008:0	O Lord God of hosts , who is a strong Lord like unto thee ? or to thy faithfulness round about thee ?
19:89:009:0	Thou rulest the raging of the sea : when the waves thereof arise , thou stillest them .
19:89:010:0	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces , as one that is slain ; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm .
19:89:011:0	The heavens are thine , the earth also is thine : as for the world and the fulness thereof , thou hast founded them .
19:89:012:0	The north and the south thou hast created them : Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name .
19:89:013:0	Thou hast a mighty arm : strong is thy hand , and high is thy right hand .
19:89:014:0	Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne : mercy and truth shall go before thy face .
19:89:015:0	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , O Lord , in the light of thy countenance .
19:89:016:0	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day : and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted .
19:89:017:0	For thou art the glory of their strength : and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted .
19:89:018:0	For the Lord is our defence ; and the Holy One of Israel is our king .
19:89:019:0	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , I have laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of the people .
19:89:020:0	I have found David my servant ; with my holy oil have I anointed him :
19:89:021:0	With whom my hand shall be established : mine arm also shall strengthen him .
19:89:022:0	The enemy shall not exact upon him ; nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
19:89:023:0	And I will beat down his foes before his face , and plague them that hate him .
19:89:024:0	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him : and in my name shall his horn be exalted .
19:89:025:0	I will set his hand also in the sea , and his right hand in the rivers .
19:89:026:0	He shall cry unto me , Thou art my father , my God , and the rock of my salvation .
19:89:027:0	Also I will make him my firstborn , higher than the kings of the earth .
19:89:028:0	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore , and my covenant shall stand fast with him .
19:89:029:0	His seed also will I make to endure for ever , and his throne as the days of heaven .
19:89:030:0	If his children forsake my law , and walk not in my judgments ;
19:89:031:0	If they break my statutes , and keep not my commandments ;
19:89:032:0	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
19:89:033:0	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail .
19:89:034:0	My covenant will I not break , nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips .
19:89:035:0	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David .
19:89:036:0	His seed shall endure for ever , and his throne as the sun before me .
19:89:037:0	It shall be established for ever as the moon , and as a faithful witness in heaven . Selah .
19:89:038:0	But thou hast cast off and abhorred , thou hast been wroth with thine anointed .
19:89:039:0	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant : thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground .
19:89:040:0	Thou hast broken down all his hedges ; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin .
19:89:041:0	All that pass by the way spoil him : he is a reproach to his neighbours .
19:89:042:0	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries ; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice .
19:89:043:0	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword , and hast not made him to stand in the battle .
19:89:044:0	Thou hast made his glory to cease , and cast his throne down to the ground .
19:89:045:0	The days of his youth hast thou shortened : thou hast covered him with shame . Selah .
19:89:046:0	How long , Lord ? wilt thou hide thyself for ever ? shall thy wrath burn like fire ?
19:89:047:0	Remember how short my time is : wherefore hast thou made all men in vain ?
19:89:048:0	What man is he that liveth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? Selah .
19:89:049:0	Lord , where are thy former lovingkindnesses , which thou swarest unto David in thy truth ?
19:89:050:0	Remember , Lord , the reproach of thy servants ; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people ;
19:89:051:0	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached , O Lord ; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed .
19:89:052:0	Blessed be the Lord for evermore . Amen , and Amen .
