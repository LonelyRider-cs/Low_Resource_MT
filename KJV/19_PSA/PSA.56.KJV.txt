19:56:001:0	Be merciful unto me , O God : for man would swallow me up ; he fighting daily oppresseth me .
19:56:002:0	Mine enemies would daily swallow me up : for they be many that fight against me , O thou most High .
19:56:003:0	What time I am afraid , I will trust in thee .
19:56:004:0	In God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me .
19:56:005:0	Every day they wrest my words : all their thoughts are against me for evil .
19:56:006:0	They gather themselves together , they hide themselves , they mark my steps , when they wait for my soul .
19:56:007:0	Shall they escape by iniquity ? in thine anger cast down the people , O God .
19:56:008:0	Thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
19:56:009:0	When I cry unto thee , then shall mine enemies turn back : this I know ; for God is for me .
19:56:010:0	In God will I praise his word : in the Lord will I praise his word .
19:56:011:0	In God have I put my trust : I will not be afraid what man can do unto me .
19:56:012:0	Thy vows are upon me , O God : I will render praises unto thee .
19:56:013:0	For thou hast delivered my soul from death : wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living ?
