19:81:001:0	Sing aloud unto God our strength : make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob .
19:81:002:0	Take a psalm , and bring hither the timbrel , the pleasant harp with the psaltery .
19:81:003:0	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon , in the time appointed , on our solemn feast day .
19:81:004:0	For this was a statute for Israel , and a law of the God of Jacob .
19:81:005:0	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of Egypt : where I heard a language that I understood not .
19:81:006:0	I removed his shoulder from the burden : his hands were delivered from the pots .
19:81:007:0	Thou calledst in trouble , and I delivered thee ; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder : I proved thee at the waters of Meribah . Selah .
19:81:008:0	Hear , O my people , and I will testify unto thee : O Israel , if thou wilt hearken unto me ;
19:81:009:0	There shall no strange god be in thee ; neither shalt thou worship any strange god .
19:81:010:0	I am the Lord thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt : open thy mouth wide , and I will fill it .
19:81:011:0	But my people would not hearken to my voice ; and Israel would none of me .
19:81:012:0	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust : and they walked in their own counsels .
19:81:013:0	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me , and Israel had walked in my ways !
19:81:014:0	I should soon have subdued their enemies , and turned my hand against their adversaries .
19:81:015:0	The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him : but their time should have endured for ever .
19:81:016:0	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee .
