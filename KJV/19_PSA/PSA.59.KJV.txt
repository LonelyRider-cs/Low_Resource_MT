19:59:001:0	Deliver me from mine enemies , O my God : defend me from them that rise up against me .
19:59:002:0	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity , and save me from bloody men .
19:59:003:0	For , lo , they lie in wait for my soul : the mighty are gathered against me ; not for my transgression , nor for my sin , O .
19:59:004:0	They run and prepare themselves without my fault : awake to help me , and behold .
19:59:005:0	Thou therefore , O God of hosts , the God of Israel , awake to visit all the heathen : be not merciful to any wicked transgressors . Selah .
19:59:006:0	They return at evening : they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
19:59:007:0	Behold , they belch out with their mouth : swords are in their lips : for who , say they , doth hear ?
19:59:008:0	But thou , O , shalt laugh at them ; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision .
19:59:009:0	Because of his strength will I wait upon thee : for God is my defence .
19:59:010:0	The God of my mercy shall prevent me : God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies .
19:59:011:0	Slay them not , lest my people forget : scatter them by thy power ; and bring them down , O Lord our shield .
19:59:012:0	For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speak .
19:59:013:0	Consume them in wrath , consume them , that they may not be : and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth . Selah .
19:59:014:0	And at evening let them return ; and let them make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
19:59:015:0	Let them wander up and down for meat , and grudge if they be not satisfied .
19:59:016:0	But I will sing of thy power ; yea , I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
19:59:017:0	Unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mercy .
