19:135:001:0	Praise ye the Lord . Praise ye the name of the Lord ; praise him , O ye servants of the Lord .
19:135:002:0	Ye that stand in the house of the Lord , in the courts of the house of our God ,
19:135:003:0	Praise the Lord ; for the Lord is good : sing praises unto his name ; for it is pleasant .
19:135:004:0	For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself , and Israel for his peculiar treasure .
19:135:005:0	For I know that the Lord is great , and that our Lord is above all gods .
19:135:006:0	Whatsoever the Lord pleased , that did he in heaven , and in earth , in the seas , and all deep places .
19:135:007:0	He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain ; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries .
19:135:008:0	Who smote the firstborn of Egypt , both of man and beast .
19:135:009:0	Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee , O Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his servants .
19:135:010:0	Who smote great nations , and slew mighty kings ;
19:135:011:0	Sihon king of the Amorites , and Og king of Bashan , and all the kingdoms of Canaan :
19:135:012:0	And gave their land for an heritage , an heritage unto Israel his people .
19:135:013:0	Thy name , O Lord , endureth for ever ; and thy memorial , O Lord , throughout all generations .
19:135:014:0	For the Lord will judge his people , and he will repent himself concerning his servants .
19:135:015:0	The idols of the heathen are silver and gold , the work of men's hands .
19:135:016:0	They have mouths , but they speak not ; eyes have they , but they see not ;
19:135:017:0	They have ears , but they hear not ; neither is there any breath in their mouths .
19:135:018:0	They that make them are like unto them : so is every one that trusteth in them .
19:135:019:0	Bless the Lord , O house of Israel : bless the Lord , O house of Aaron :
19:135:020:0	Bless the Lord , O house of Levi : ye that fear the Lord , bless the Lord .
19:135:021:0	Blessed be the Lord out of Zion , which dwelleth at Jerusalem . Praise ye the Lord .
