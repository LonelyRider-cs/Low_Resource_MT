19:23:001:0	The is my shepherd ; I shall not want .
19:23:002:0	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters .
19:23:003:0	He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake .
19:23:004:0	Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
19:23:005:0	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
19:23:006:0	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the for ever .
