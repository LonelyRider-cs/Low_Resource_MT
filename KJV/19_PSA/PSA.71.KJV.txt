19:71:001:0	In thee , O Lord , do I put my trust : let me never be put to confusion .
19:71:002:0	Deliver me in thy righteousness , and cause me to escape : incline thine ear unto me , and save me .
19:71:003:0	Be thou my strong habitation , whereunto I may continually resort : thou hast given commandment to save me ; for thou art my rock and my fortress .
19:71:004:0	Deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
19:71:005:0	For thou art my hope , O Lord God : thou art my trust from my youth .
19:71:006:0	By thee have I been holden up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
19:71:007:0	I am as a wonder unto many ; but thou art my strong refuge .
19:71:008:0	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day .
19:71:009:0	Cast me not off in the time of old age ; forsake me not when my strength faileth .
19:71:010:0	For mine enemies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together ,
19:71:011:0	Saying , God hath forsaken him : persecute and take him ; for there is none to deliver him .
19:71:012:0	O God , be not far from me : O my God , make haste for my help .
19:71:013:0	Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
19:71:014:0	But I will hope continually , and will yet praise thee more and more .
19:71:015:0	My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day ; for I know not the numbers thereof .
19:71:016:0	I will go in the strength of the Lord God : I will make mention of thy righteousness , even of thine only .
19:71:017:0	O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works .
19:71:018:0	Now also when I am old and grayheaded , O God , forsake me not ; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation , and thy power to every one that is to come .
19:71:019:0	Thy righteousness also , O God , is very high , who hast done great things : O God , who is like unto thee !
19:71:020:0	Thou , which hast shewed me great and sore troubles , shalt quicken me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth .
19:71:021:0	Thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort me on every side .
19:71:022:0	I will also praise thee with the psaltery , even thy truth , O my God : unto thee will I sing with the harp , O thou Holy One of Israel .
19:71:023:0	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee ; and my soul , which thou hast redeemed .
19:71:024:0	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long : for they are confounded , for they are brought unto shame , that seek my hurt .
