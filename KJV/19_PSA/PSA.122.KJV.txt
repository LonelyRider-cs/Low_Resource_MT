19:122:001:0	I was glad when they said unto me , Let us go into the house of the Lord .
19:122:002:0	Our feet shall stand within thy gates , O Jerusalem .
19:122:003:0	Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together :
19:122:004:0	Whither the tribes go up , the tribes of the Lord , unto the testimony of Israel , to give thanks unto the name of the Lord .
19:122:005:0	For there are set thrones of judgment , the thrones of the house of David .
19:122:006:0	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee .
19:122:007:0	Peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
19:122:008:0	For my brethren and companions' sakes , I will now say , Peace be within thee .
19:122:009:0	Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good .
