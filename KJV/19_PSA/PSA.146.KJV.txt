19:146:001:0	Praise ye the Lord . Praise the Lord , O my soul .
19:146:002:0	While I live will I praise the Lord : I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being .
19:146:003:0	Put not your trust in princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help .
19:146:004:0	His breath goeth forth , he returneth to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish .
19:146:005:0	Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in the Lord his God :
19:146:006:0	Which made heaven , and earth , the sea , and all that therein is : which keepeth truth for ever :
19:146:007:0	Which executeth judgment for the oppressed : which giveth food to the hungry . The Lord looseth the prisoners :
19:146:008:0	The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind : the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down : the Lord loveth the righteous :
19:146:009:0	The Lord preserveth the strangers ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down .
19:146:010:0	The Lord shall reign for ever , even thy God , O Zion , unto all generations . Praise ye the Lord .
