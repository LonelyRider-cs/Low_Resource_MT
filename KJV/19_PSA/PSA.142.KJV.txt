19:142:001:0	I cried unto the with my voice ; with my voice unto the did I make my supplication .
19:142:002:0	I poured out my complaint before him ; I shewed before him my trouble .
19:142:003:0	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me , then thou knewest my path . In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
19:142:004:0	I looked on my right hand , and beheld , but there was no man that would know me : refuge failed me ; no man cared for my soul .
19:142:005:0	I cried unto thee , O : I said , Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living .
19:142:006:0	Attend unto my cry ; for I am brought very low : deliver me from my persecutors ; for they are stronger than I .
19:142:007:0	Bring my soul out of prison , that I may praise thy name : the righteous shall compass me about ; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me .
