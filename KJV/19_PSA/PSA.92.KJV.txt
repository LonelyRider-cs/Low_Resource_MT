19:92:001:0	It is a good thing to give thanks unto the , and to sing praises unto thy name , O most High :
19:92:002:0	To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning , and thy faithfulness every night ,
19:92:003:0	Upon an instrument of ten strings , and upon the psaltery ; upon the harp with a solemn sound .
19:92:004:0	For thou , , hast made me glad through thy work : I will triumph in the works of thy hands .
19:92:005:0	O , how great are thy works ! and thy thoughts are very deep .
19:92:006:0	A brutish man knoweth not ; neither doth a fool understand this .
19:92:007:0	When the wicked spring as the grass , and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish ; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever :
19:92:008:0	But thou , , art most high for evermore .
19:92:009:0	For , lo , thine enemies , O , for , lo , thine enemies shall perish ; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered .
19:92:010:0	But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn : I shall be anointed with fresh oil .
19:92:011:0	Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies , and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me .
19:92:012:0	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree : he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon .
19:92:013:0	Those that be planted in the house of the shall flourish in the courts of our God .
19:92:014:0	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age ; they shall be fat and flourishing ;
19:92:015:0	To shew that the is upright : he is my rock , and there is no unrighteousness in him .
