19:57:001:0	Be merciful unto me , O God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
19:57:002:0	I will cry unto God most high ; unto God that performeth all things for me .
19:57:003:0	He shall send from heaven , and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up . Selah . God shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
19:57:004:0	My soul is among lions : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
19:57:005:0	Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens ; let thy glory be above all the earth .
19:57:006:0	They have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
19:57:007:0	My heart is fixed , O God , my heart is fixed : I will sing and give praise .
19:57:008:0	Awake up , my glory ; awake , psaltery and harp : I myself will awake early .
19:57:009:0	I will praise thee , O Lord , among the people : I will sing unto thee among the nations .
19:57:010:0	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens , and thy truth unto the clouds .
19:57:011:0	Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens : let thy glory be above all the earth .
