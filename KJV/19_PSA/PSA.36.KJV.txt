19:36:001:0	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart , that there is no fear of God before his eyes .
19:36:002:0	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes , until his iniquity be found to be hateful .
19:36:003:0	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit : he hath left off to be wise , and to do good .
19:36:004:0	He deviseth mischief upon his bed ; he setteth himself in a way that is not good ; he abhorreth not evil .
19:36:005:0	Thy mercy , O , is in the heavens ; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds .
19:36:006:0	Thy righteousness is like the great mountains ; thy judgments are a great deep : O , thou preservest man and beast .
19:36:007:0	How excellent is thy lovingkindness , O God ! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings .
19:36:008:0	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house ; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures .
19:36:009:0	For with thee is the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light .
19:36:010:0	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee ; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart .
19:36:011:0	Let not the foot of pride come against me , and let not the hand of the wicked remove me .
19:36:012:0	There are the workers of iniquity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
