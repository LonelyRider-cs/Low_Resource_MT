19:147:001:0	Praise ye the Lord : for it is good to sing praises unto our God ; for it is pleasant ; and praise is comely .
19:147:002:0	The Lord doth build up Jerusalem : he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel .
19:147:003:0	He healeth the broken in heart , and bindeth up their wounds .
19:147:004:0	He telleth the number of the stars ; he calleth them all by their names .
19:147:005:0	Great is our Lord , and of great power : his understanding is infinite .
19:147:006:0	The Lord lifteth up the meek : he casteth the wicked down to the ground .
19:147:007:0	Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving ; sing praise upon the harp unto our God :
19:147:008:0	Who covereth the heaven with clouds , who prepareth rain for the earth , who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains .
19:147:009:0	He giveth to the beast his food , and to the young ravens which cry .
19:147:010:0	He delighteth not in the strength of the horse : he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man .
19:147:011:0	The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him , in those that hope in his mercy .
19:147:012:0	Praise the Lord , O Jerusalem ; praise thy God , O Zion .
19:147:013:0	For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates ; he hath blessed thy children within thee .
19:147:014:0	He maketh peace in thy borders , and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat .
19:147:015:0	He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth : his word runneth very swiftly .
19:147:016:0	He giveth snow like wool : he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes .
19:147:017:0	He casteth forth his ice like morsels : who can stand before his cold ?
19:147:018:0	He sendeth out his word , and melteth them : he causeth his wind to blow , and the waters flow .
19:147:019:0	He sheweth his word unto Jacob , his statutes and his judgments unto Israel .
19:147:020:0	He hath not dealt so with any nation : and as for his judgments , they have not known them . Praise ye the Lord .
