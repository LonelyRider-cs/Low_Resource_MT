17:3:001:0	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes that were with him .
17:3:002:0	And all the king's servants , that were in the king's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . But Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
17:3:003:0	Then the king's servants , which were in the king's gate , said unto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king's commandment ?
17:3:004:0	Now it came to pass , when they spake daily unto him , and he hearkened not unto them , that they told Haman , to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand : for he had told them that he was a Jew .
17:3:005:0	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , then was Haman full of wrath .
17:3:006:0	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai .
17:3:007:0	In the first month , that is , the month Nisan , in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus , they cast Pur , that is , the lot , before Haman from day to day , and from month to month , to the twelfth month , that is , the month Adar .
17:3:008:0	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus , There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom ; and their laws are diverse from all people ; neither keep they the king's laws : therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them .
17:3:009:0	If it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king's treasuries .
17:3:010:0	And the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews' enemy .
17:3:011:0	And the king said unto Haman , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
17:3:012:0	Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month , and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants , and to the governors that were over every province , and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people after their language ; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written , and sealed with the king's ring .
17:3:013:0	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish , all Jews , both young and old , little children and women , in one day , even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar , and to take the spoil of them for a prey .
17:3:014:0	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
17:3:015:0	The posts went out , being hastened by the king's commandment , and the decree was given in Shushan the palace . And the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city Shushan was perplexed .
