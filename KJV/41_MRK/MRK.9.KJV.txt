41:9:001:0	And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
41:9:002:0	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
41:9:003:0	And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
41:9:004:0	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
41:9:005:0	And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
41:9:006:0	For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
41:9:007:0	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
41:9:008:0	And suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
41:9:009:0	And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
41:9:010:0	And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
41:9:011:0	And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
41:9:012:0	And he answered and told them , Elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
41:9:013:0	But I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
41:9:014:0	And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
41:9:015:0	And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
41:9:016:0	And he asked the scribes , What question ye with them ?
41:9:017:0	And one of the multitude answered and said , Master , I have brought unto thee my son , which hath a dumb spirit ;
41:9:018:0	And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
41:9:019:0	He answereth him , and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me .
41:9:020:0	And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
41:9:021:0	And he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ? And he said , Of a child .
41:9:022:0	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
41:9:023:0	Jesus said unto him , If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
41:9:024:0	And straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
41:9:025:0	When Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
41:9:026:0	And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
41:9:027:0	But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
41:9:028:0	And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ?
41:9:029:0	And he said unto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
41:9:030:0	And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
41:9:031:0	For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
41:9:032:0	But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
41:9:033:0	And he came to Capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
41:9:034:0	But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
41:9:035:0	And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
41:9:036:0	And he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
41:9:037:0	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
41:9:038:0	And John answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us : and we forbad him , because he followeth not us .
41:9:039:0	But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
41:9:040:0	For he that is not against us is on our part .
41:9:041:0	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
41:9:042:0	And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
41:9:043:0	And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
41:9:044:0	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
41:9:045:0	And if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
41:9:046:0	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
41:9:047:0	And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
41:9:048:0	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
41:9:049:0	For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
41:9:050:0	Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
