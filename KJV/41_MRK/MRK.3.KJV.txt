41:3:001:0	And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
41:3:002:0	And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
41:3:003:0	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
41:3:004:0	And he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? But they held their peace .
41:3:005:0	And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
41:3:006:0	And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
41:3:007:0	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
41:3:008:0	And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
41:3:009:0	And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
41:3:010:0	For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
41:3:011:0	And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
41:3:012:0	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
41:3:013:0	And he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
41:3:014:0	And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
41:3:015:0	And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
41:3:016:0	And Simon he surnamed Peter ;
41:3:017:0	And James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder :
41:3:018:0	And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
41:3:019:0	And Judas Iscariot , which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
41:3:020:0	And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
41:3:021:0	And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
41:3:022:0	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils .
41:3:023:0	And he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41:3:024:0	And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
41:3:025:0	And if a house be divided against itself , that house can not stand .
41:3:026:0	And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he can not stand , but hath an end .
41:3:027:0	No man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
41:3:028:0	Verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
41:3:029:0	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation :
41:3:030:0	Because they said , He hath an unclean spirit .
41:3:031:0	There came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
41:3:032:0	And the multitude sat about him , and they said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
41:3:033:0	And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ?
41:3:034:0	And he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
41:3:035:0	For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .
