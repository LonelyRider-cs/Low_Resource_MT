41:8:001:0	In those days the multitude being very great , and having nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples unto him , and saith unto them ,
41:8:002:0	I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
41:8:003:0	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
41:8:004:0	And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
41:8:005:0	And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven .
41:8:006:0	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
41:8:007:0	And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
41:8:008:0	So they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
41:8:009:0	And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
41:8:010:0	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
41:8:011:0	And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
41:8:012:0	And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
41:8:013:0	And he left them , and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
41:8:014:0	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
41:8:015:0	And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
41:8:016:0	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
41:8:017:0	And when Jesus knew it , he saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
41:8:018:0	Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
41:8:019:0	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say unto him , Twelve .
41:8:020:0	And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven .
41:8:021:0	And he said unto them , How is it that ye do not understand ?
41:8:022:0	And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
41:8:023:0	And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
41:8:024:0	And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walking .
41:8:025:0	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
41:8:026:0	And he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
41:8:027:0	And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Whom do men say that I am ?
41:8:028:0	And they answered , John the Baptist : but some say , Elias ; and others , One of the prophets .
41:8:029:0	And he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
41:8:030:0	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
41:8:031:0	And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41:8:032:0	And he spake that saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
41:8:033:0	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
41:8:034:0	And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
41:8:035:0	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it .
41:8:036:0	For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
41:8:037:0	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
41:8:038:0	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
