41:14:001:0	After two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
41:14:002:0	But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
41:14:003:0	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
41:14:004:0	And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ?
41:14:005:0	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her .
41:14:006:0	And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
41:14:007:0	For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
41:14:008:0	She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
41:14:009:0	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
41:14:010:0	And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
41:14:011:0	And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
41:14:012:0	And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
41:14:013:0	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
41:14:014:0	And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
41:14:015:0	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
41:14:016:0	And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
41:14:017:0	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
41:14:018:0	And as they sat and did eat , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
41:14:019:0	And they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
41:14:020:0	And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
41:14:021:0	The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
41:14:022:0	And as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
41:14:023:0	And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
41:14:024:0	And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
41:14:025:0	Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
41:14:026:0	And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
41:14:027:0	And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
41:14:028:0	But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee .
41:14:029:0	But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I .
41:14:030:0	And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
41:14:031:0	But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all .
41:14:032:0	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
41:14:033:0	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
41:14:034:0	And saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here , and watch .
41:14:035:0	And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
41:14:036:0	And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
41:14:037:0	And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
41:14:038:0	Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
41:14:039:0	And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
41:14:040:0	And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
41:14:041:0	And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41:14:042:0	Rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
41:14:043:0	And immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
41:14:044:0	And he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
41:14:045:0	And as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
41:14:046:0	And they laid their hands on him , and took him .
41:14:047:0	And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
41:14:048:0	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
41:14:049:0	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
41:14:050:0	And they all forsook him , and fled .
41:14:051:0	And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
41:14:052:0	And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
41:14:053:0	And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
41:14:054:0	And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
41:14:055:0	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
41:14:056:0	For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
41:14:057:0	And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
41:14:058:0	We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
41:14:059:0	But neither so did their witness agree together .
41:14:060:0	And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
41:14:061:0	But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
41:14:062:0	And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
41:14:063:0	Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ?
41:14:064:0	Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
41:14:065:0	And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
41:14:066:0	And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
41:14:067:0	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
41:14:068:0	But he denied , saying , I know not , neither understand I what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
41:14:069:0	And a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
41:14:070:0	And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
41:14:071:0	But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
41:14:072:0	And the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept .
