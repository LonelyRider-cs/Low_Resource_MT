41:10:001:0	And he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
41:10:002:0	And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
41:10:003:0	And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ?
41:10:004:0	And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
41:10:005:0	And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
41:10:006:0	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
41:10:007:0	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ;
41:10:008:0	And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
41:10:009:0	What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
41:10:010:0	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
41:10:011:0	And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
41:10:012:0	And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
41:10:013:0	And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
41:10:014:0	But when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
41:10:015:0	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
41:10:016:0	And he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
41:10:017:0	And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
41:10:018:0	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God .
41:10:019:0	Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
41:10:020:0	And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth .
41:10:021:0	Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
41:10:022:0	And he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
41:10:023:0	And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
41:10:024:0	And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
41:10:025:0	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
41:10:026:0	And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
41:10:027:0	And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
41:10:028:0	Then Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
41:10:029:0	And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel's ,
41:10:030:0	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
41:10:031:0	But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
41:10:032:0	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
41:10:033:0	Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles :
41:10:034:0	And they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
41:10:035:0	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , come unto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
41:10:036:0	And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
41:10:037:0	They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
41:10:038:0	But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
41:10:039:0	And they said unto him , We can . And Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
41:10:040:0	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
41:10:041:0	And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
41:10:042:0	But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
41:10:043:0	But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
41:10:044:0	And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
41:10:045:0	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
41:10:046:0	And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
41:10:047:0	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
41:10:048:0	And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
41:10:049:0	And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
41:10:050:0	And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
41:10:051:0	And Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
41:10:052:0	And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
