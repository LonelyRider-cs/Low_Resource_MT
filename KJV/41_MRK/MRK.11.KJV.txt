41:11:001:0	And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
41:11:002:0	And saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
41:11:003:0	And if any man say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
41:11:004:0	And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
41:11:005:0	And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
41:11:006:0	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
41:11:007:0	And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
41:11:008:0	And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
41:11:009:0	And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
41:11:010:0	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest .
41:11:011:0	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
41:11:012:0	And on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry :
41:11:013:0	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
41:11:014:0	And Jesus answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . And his disciples heard it .
41:11:015:0	And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
41:11:016:0	And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
41:11:017:0	And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
41:11:018:0	And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
41:11:019:0	And when even was come , he went out of the city .
41:11:020:0	And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
41:11:021:0	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
41:11:022:0	And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God .
41:11:023:0	For verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
41:11:024:0	Therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
41:11:025:0	And when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
41:11:026:0	But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses .
41:11:027:0	And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
41:11:028:0	And say unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
41:11:029:0	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41:11:030:0	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? answer me .
41:11:031:0	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
41:11:032:0	But if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
41:11:033:0	And they answered and said unto Jesus , We cannot tell . And Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
