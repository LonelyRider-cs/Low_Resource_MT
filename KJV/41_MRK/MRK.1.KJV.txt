41:1:001:0	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
41:1:002:0	As it is written in the prophets , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
41:1:003:0	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
41:1:004:0	John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
41:1:005:0	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
41:1:006:0	And John was clothed with camel's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
41:1:007:0	And preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
41:1:008:0	I indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost .
41:1:009:0	And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
41:1:010:0	And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
41:1:011:0	And there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
41:1:012:0	And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
41:1:013:0	And he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
41:1:014:0	Now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
41:1:015:0	And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
41:1:016:0	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
41:1:017:0	And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
41:1:018:0	And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
41:1:019:0	And when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
41:1:020:0	And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
41:1:021:0	And they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
41:1:022:0	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
41:1:023:0	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
41:1:024:0	Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
41:1:025:0	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
41:1:026:0	And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
41:1:027:0	And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
41:1:028:0	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
41:1:029:0	And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41:1:030:0	But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
41:1:031:0	And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
41:1:032:0	And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
41:1:033:0	And all the city was gathered together at the door .
41:1:034:0	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
41:1:035:0	And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
41:1:036:0	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
41:1:037:0	And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
41:1:038:0	And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
41:1:039:0	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
41:1:040:0	And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
41:1:041:0	And Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
41:1:042:0	And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
41:1:043:0	And he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
41:1:044:0	And saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
41:1:045:0	But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
