1:14:001:0	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , and Tidal king of nations ;
1:14:002:0	That these made war with Bera king of Sodom , and with Birsha king of Gomorrah , Shinab king of Admah , and Shemeber king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar .
1:14:003:0	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim , which is the salt sea .
1:14:004:0	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
1:14:005:0	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzims in Ham , and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim ,
1:14:006:0	And the Horites in their mount Seir , unto El–paran , which is by the wilderness .
1:14:007:0	And they returned , and came to En–mishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that dwelt in Hazazon–tamar .
1:14:008:0	And there went out the king of Sodom , and the king of Gomorrah , and the king of Admah , and the king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ; ) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim ;
1:14:009:0	With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam , and with Tidal king of nations , and Amraphel king of Shinar , and Arioch king of Ellasar ; four kings with five .
1:14:010:0	And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and fell there ; and they that remained fled to the mountain .
1:14:011:0	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
1:14:012:0	And they took Lot , Abram's brother's son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
1:14:013:0	And there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eshcol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
1:14:014:0	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and eighteen , and pursued them unto Dan .
1:14:015:0	And he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
1:14:016:0	And he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother Lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
1:14:017:0	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer , and of the kings that were with him , at the valley of Shaveh , which is the king's dale .
1:14:018:0	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was the priest of the most high God .
1:14:019:0	And he blessed him , and said , Blessed be Abram of the most high God , possessor of heaven and earth :
1:14:020:0	And blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand . And he gave him tithes of all .
1:14:021:0	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram , Give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
1:14:022:0	And Abram said to the king of Sodom , I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord , the most high God , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
1:14:023:0	That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet , and that I will not take any thing that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , I have made Abram rich :
1:14:024:0	Save only that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men which went with me , Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre ; let them take their portion .
