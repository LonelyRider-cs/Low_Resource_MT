1:45:001:0	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . And there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
1:45:002:0	And he wept aloud : and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard .
1:45:003:0	And Joseph said unto his brethren , I am Joseph ; doth my father yet live ? And his brethren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
1:45:004:0	And Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . And they came near . And he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
1:45:005:0	Now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
1:45:006:0	For these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
1:45:007:0	And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
1:45:008:0	So now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
1:45:009:0	Haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith thy son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
1:45:010:0	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children 's children , and thy flocks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
1:45:011:0	And there will I nourish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
1:45:012:0	And , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
1:45:013:0	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
1:45:014:0	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin 's neck , and wept ; and Benjamin wept upon his neck .
1:45:015:0	Moreover he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
1:45:016:0	And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , Joseph 's brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
1:45:017:0	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto thy brethren , This do ye ; lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
1:45:018:0	And take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
1:45:019:0	Now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
1:45:020:0	Also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours .
1:45:021:0	And the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
1:45:022:0	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
1:45:023:0	And to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
1:45:024:0	So he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
1:45:025:0	And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father ,
1:45:026:0	And told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . And Jacob 's heart fainted , for he believed them not .
1:45:027:0	And they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
1:45:028:0	And Israel said , It is enough ; Joseph my son is yet alive : I will go and see him before I die .
