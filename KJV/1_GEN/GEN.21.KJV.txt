1:21:001:0	And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said , and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken .
1:21:002:0	For Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
1:21:003:0	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .
1:21:004:0	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
1:21:005:0	And Abraham was an hundred years old , when his son Isaac was born unto him .
1:21:006:0	And Sarah said , God hath made me to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with me .
1:21:007:0	And she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children suck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
1:21:008:0	And the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
1:21:009:0	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , which she had born unto Abraham , mocking .
1:21:010:0	Wherefore she said unto Abraham , Cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
1:21:011:0	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son .
1:21:012:0	And God said unto Abraham , Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
1:21:013:0	And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
1:21:014:0	And Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave it unto Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Beer–sheba .
1:21:015:0	And the water was spent in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
1:21:016:0	And she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . And she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
1:21:017:0	And God heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven , and said unto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ? fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
1:21:018:0	Arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thine hand ; for I will make him a great nation .
1:21:019:0	And God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
1:21:020:0	And God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
1:21:021:0	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
1:21:022:0	And it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest :
1:21:023:0	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me , nor with my son , nor with my son's son : but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee , thou shalt do unto me , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned .
1:21:024:0	And Abraham said , I will swear .
1:21:025:0	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water , which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away .
1:21:026:0	And Abimelech said , I wot not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard I of it , but to day .
1:21:027:0	And Abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto Abimelech ; and both of them made a covenant .
1:21:028:0	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
1:21:029:0	And Abimelech said unto Abraham , What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ?
1:21:030:0	And he said , For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that I have digged this well .
1:21:031:0	Wherefore he called that place Beer–sheba ; because there they sware both of them .
1:21:032:0	Thus they made a covenant at Beer–sheba : then Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
1:21:033:0	And Abraham planted a grove in Beer–sheba , and called there on the name of the Lord , the everlasting God .
1:21:034:0	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days .
