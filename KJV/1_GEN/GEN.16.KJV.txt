1:16:001:0	Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
1:16:002:0	And Sarai said unto Abram , Behold now , the Lord hath restrained me from bearing : I pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that I may obtain children by her . And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai .
1:16:003:0	And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
1:16:004:0	And he went in unto Hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
1:16:005:0	And Sarai said unto Abram , My wrong be upon thee : I have given my maid into thy bosom ; and when she saw that she had conceived , I was despised in her eyes : the Lord judge between me and thee .
1:16:006:0	But Abram said unto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thy hand ; do to her as it pleaseth thee . And when Sarai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
1:16:007:0	And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
1:16:008:0	And he said , Hagar , Sarai's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ? And she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
1:16:009:0	And the angel of the Lord said unto her , Return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
1:16:010:0	And the angel of the Lord said unto her , I will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
1:16:011:0	And the angel of the Lord said unto her , Behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction .
1:16:012:0	And he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man's hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
1:16:013:0	And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her , Thou God seest me : for she said , Have I also here looked after him that seeth me ?
1:16:014:0	Wherefore the well was called Beer–lahai–roi ; behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
1:16:015:0	And Hagar bare Abram a son : and Abram called his son's name , which Hagar bare , Ishmael .
1:16:016:0	And Abram was fourscore and six years old , when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram .
