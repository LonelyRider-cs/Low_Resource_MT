1:15:001:0	After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision , saying , Fear not , Abram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
1:15:002:0	And Abram said , Lord God , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ?
1:15:003:0	And Abram said , Behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
1:15:004:0	And , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
1:15:005:0	And he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
1:15:006:0	And he believed in the Lord ; and he counted it to him for righteousness .
1:15:007:0	And he said unto him , I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans , to give thee this land to inherit it .
1:15:008:0	And he said , Lord God , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it ?
1:15:009:0	And he said unto him , Take me an heifer of three years old , and a she goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon .
1:15:010:0	And he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
1:15:011:0	And when the fowls came down upon the carcases , Abram drove them away .
1:15:012:0	And when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
1:15:013:0	And he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
1:15:014:0	And also that nation , whom they shall serve , will I judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
1:15:015:0	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
1:15:016:0	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full .
1:15:017:0	And it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces .
1:15:018:0	In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates :
1:15:019:0	The Kenites , and the Kenizzites , and the Kadmonites ,
1:15:020:0	And the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaims ,
1:15:021:0	And the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
