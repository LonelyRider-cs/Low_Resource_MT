1:33:001:0	And Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau came , and with him four hundred men . And he divided the children unto Leah , and unto Rachel , and unto the two handmaids .
1:33:002:0	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph hindermost .
1:33:003:0	And he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
1:33:004:0	And Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
1:33:005:0	And he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , Who are those with thee ? And he said , The children which God hath graciously given thy servant .
1:33:006:0	Then the handmaidens came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
1:33:007:0	And Leah also with her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came Joseph near and Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
1:33:008:0	And he said , What meanest thou by all this drove which I met ? And he said , These are to find grace in the sight of my lord .
1:33:009:0	And Esau said , I have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
1:33:010:0	And Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
1:33:011:0	Take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . And he urged him , and he took it .
1:33:012:0	And he said , Let us take our journey , and let us go , and I will go before thee .
1:33:013:0	And he said unto him , My lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me : and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
1:33:014:0	Let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
1:33:015:0	And Esau said , Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me . And he said , What needeth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
1:33:016:0	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir .
1:33:017:0	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built him an house , and made booths for his cattle : therefore the name of the place is called Succoth .
1:33:018:0	And Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Paddan–aram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
1:33:019:0	And he bought a parcel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem's father , for an hundred pieces of money .
1:33:020:0	And he erected there an altar , and called it El–elohe–Israel .
