1:28:001:0	And Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
1:28:002:0	Arise , go to Paddan–aram , to the house of Bethuel thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother 's brother .
1:28:003:0	And God Almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
1:28:004:0	And give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
1:28:005:0	And Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Paddan–aram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother .
1:28:006:0	When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Paddan–aram , to take him a wife from thence ; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan ;
1:28:007:0	And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Paddan–aram ;
1:28:008:0	And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father ;
1:28:009:0	Then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
1:28:010:0	And Jacob went out from Beer–sheba , and went toward Haran .
1:28:011:0	And he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
1:28:012:0	And he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
1:28:013:0	And , behold , the stood above it , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ;
1:28:014:0	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
1:28:015:0	And , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
1:28:016:0	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the is in this place ; and I knew it not .
1:28:017:0	And he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
1:28:018:0	And Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
1:28:019:0	And he called the name of that place Beth–el : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
1:28:020:0	And Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
1:28:021:0	So that I come again to my father 's house in peace ; then shall the be my God :
1:28:022:0	And this stone , which I have set for a pillar , shall be God 's house : and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee .
