1:22:001:0	And it came to pass after these things , that God did tempt Abraham , and said unto him , Abraham : and he said , Behold , here I am .
1:22:002:0	And he said , Take now thy son , thine only son Isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
1:22:003:0	And Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
1:22:004:0	Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
1:22:005:0	And Abraham said unto his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you .
1:22:006:0	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
1:22:007:0	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my son . And he said , Behold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
1:22:008:0	And Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
1:22:009:0	And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
1:22:010:0	And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
1:22:011:0	And the angel of the called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I .
1:22:012:0	And he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
1:22:013:0	And Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
1:22:014:0	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh : as it is said to this day , In the mount of the it shall be seen .
1:22:015:0	And the angel of the called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time ,
1:22:016:0	And said , By myself have I sworn , saith the , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son :
1:22:017:0	That in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
1:22:018:0	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
1:22:019:0	So Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer–sheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beer–sheba .
1:22:020:0	And it came to pass after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , Behold , Milcah , she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor ;
1:22:021:0	Huz his firstborn , and Buz his brother , and Kemuel the father of Aram ,
1:22:022:0	And Chesed , and Hazo , and Pildash , and Jidlaph , and Bethuel .
1:22:023:0	And Bethuel begat Rebekah : these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor , Abraham 's brother .
1:22:024:0	And his concubine , whose name was Reumah , she bare also Tebah , and Gaham , and Thahash , and Maachah .
