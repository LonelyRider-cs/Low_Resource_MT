1:25:001:0	Then again Abraham took a wife , and her name was Keturah .
1:25:002:0	And she bare him Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah .
1:25:003:0	And Jokshan begat Sheba , and Dedan . And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim .
1:25:004:0	And the sons of Midian ; Ephah , and Epher , and Hanoch , and Abida , and Eldaah . All these were the children of Keturah .
1:25:005:0	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac .
1:25:006:0	But unto the sons of the concubines , which Abraham had , Abraham gave gifts , and sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , unto the east country .
1:25:007:0	And these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived , an hundred threescore and fifteen years .
1:25:008:0	Then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
1:25:009:0	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ;
1:25:010:0	The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth : there was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
1:25:011:0	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai–roi .
1:25:012:0	Now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bare unto Abraham :
1:25:013:0	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebaioth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
1:25:014:0	And Mishma , and Dumah , and Massa ,
1:25:015:0	Hadar , and Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah :
1:25:016:0	These are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their castles ; twelve princes according to their nations .
1:25:017:0	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
1:25:018:0	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur , that is before Egypt , as thou goest toward Assyria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
1:25:019:0	And these are the generations of Isaac , Abraham 's son : Abraham begat Isaac :
1:25:020:0	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan–aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
1:25:021:0	And Isaac entreated the for his wife , because she was barren : and the was entreated of him , and Rebekah his wife conceived .
1:25:022:0	And the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? And she went to enquire of the .
1:25:023:0	And the said unto her , Two nations are in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger .
1:25:024:0	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
1:25:025:0	And the first came out red , all over like an hairy garment ; and they called his name Esau .
1:25:026:0	And after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Esau 's heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .
1:25:027:0	And the boys grew : and Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
1:25:028:0	And Isaac loved Esau , because he did eat of his venison : but Rebekah loved Jacob .
1:25:029:0	And Jacob sod pottage : and Esau came from the field , and he was faint :
1:25:030:0	And Esau said to Jacob , Feed me , I pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for I am faint : therefore was his name called Edom .
1:25:031:0	And Jacob said , Sell me this day thy birthright .
1:25:032:0	And Esau said , Behold , I am at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to me ?
1:25:033:0	And Jacob said , Swear to me this day ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto Jacob .
1:25:034:0	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Esau despised his birthright .
