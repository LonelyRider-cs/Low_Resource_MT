1:8:001:0	And God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters assuaged ;
1:8:002:0	The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
1:8:003:0	And the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
1:8:004:0	And the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
1:8:005:0	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
1:8:006:0	And it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made :
1:8:007:0	And he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
1:8:008:0	Also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
1:8:009:0	But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
1:8:010:0	And he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
1:8:011:0	And the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
1:8:012:0	And he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the dove ; which returned not again unto him any more .
1:8:013:0	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth : and Noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and , behold , the face of the ground was dry .
1:8:014:0	And in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
1:8:015:0	And God spake unto Noah , saying ,
1:8:016:0	Go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons' wives with thee .
1:8:017:0	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
1:8:018:0	And Noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons' wives with him :
1:8:019:0	Every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
1:8:020:0	And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
1:8:021:0	And the Lord smelled a sweet savour ; and the Lord said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake ; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done .
1:8:022:0	While the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
