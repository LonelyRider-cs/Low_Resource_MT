1:10:008:0	And Cush begat Nimrod : he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
1:10:009:0	He was a mighty hunter before the Lord : wherefore it is said , Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord .
1:10:010:0	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
1:10:011:0	Out of that land went forth Asshur , and builded Nineveh , and the city Rehoboth , and Calah ,
1:10:012:0	And Resen between Nineveh and Calah : the same is a great city .
1:10:013:0	And Mizraim begat Ludim , and Anamim , and Lehabim , and Naphtuhim ,

1:10:017:0	And the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite ,
1:10:018:0	And the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite : and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad .
1:10:019:0	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboiim , even unto Lasha .
1:10:020:0	These are the sons of Ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
1:10:021:0	Unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
1:10:022:0	The children of Shem ; Elam , and Asshur , and Arphaxad , and Lud , and Aram .
1:10:023:0	And the children of Aram ; Uz , and Hul , and Gether , and Mash .
1:10:024:0	And Arphaxad begat Salah ; and Salah begat Eber .
1:10:025:0	And unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother's name was Joktan .
1:10:026:0	And Joktan begat Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah ,
1:10:027:0	And Hadoram , and Uzal , and Diklah ,

1:10:030:0	And their dwelling was from Mesha , as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east .
1:10:031:0	These are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
1:10:032:0	These are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
