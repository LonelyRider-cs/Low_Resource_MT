1:37:001:0	And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
1:37:002:0	These are the generations of Jacob . Joseph , being seventeen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren ; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah , and with the sons of Zilpah , his father 's wives : and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report .
1:37:003:0	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
1:37:004:0	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren , they hated him , and could not speak peaceably unto him .
1:37:005:0	And Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
1:37:006:0	And he said unto them , Hear , I pray you , this dream which I have dreamed :
1:37:007:0	For , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
1:37:008:0	And his brethren said to him , Shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
1:37:009:0	And he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
1:37:010:0	And he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebuked him , and said unto him , What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
1:37:011:0	And his brethren envied him ; but his father observed the saying .
1:37:012:0	And his brethren went to feed their father 's flock in Shechem .
1:37:013:0	And Israel said unto Joseph , Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send thee unto them . And he said to him , Here am I .
1:37:014:0	And he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flocks ; and bring me word again . So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
1:37:015:0	And a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
1:37:016:0	And he said , I seek my brethren : tell me , I pray thee , where they feed their flocks .
1:37:017:0	And the man said , They are departed hence ; for I heard them say , Let us go to Dothan . And Joseph went after his brethren , and found them in Dothan .
1:37:018:0	And when they saw him afar off , even before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
1:37:019:0	And they said one to another , Behold , this dreamer cometh .
1:37:020:0	Come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
1:37:021:0	And Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
1:37:022:0	And Reuben said unto them , Shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
1:37:023:0	And it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
1:37:024:0	And they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
1:37:025:0	And they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
1:37:026:0	And Judah said unto his brethren , What profit is it if we slay our brother , and conceal his blood ?
1:37:027:0	Come , and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . And his brethren were content .
1:37:028:0	Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
1:37:029:0	And Reuben returned unto the pit ; and , behold , Joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
1:37:030:0	And he returned unto his brethren , and said , The child is not ; and I , whither shall I go ?
1:37:031:0	And they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
1:37:032:0	And they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no .
1:37:033:0	And he knew it , and said , It is my son 's coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him ; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
1:37:034:0	And Jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
1:37:035:0	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . Thus his father wept for him .
1:37:036:0	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh 's , and captain of the guard .
