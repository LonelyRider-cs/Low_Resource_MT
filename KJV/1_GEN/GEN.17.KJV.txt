1:17:001:0	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
1:17:002:0	And I will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
1:17:003:0	And Abram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying ,
1:17:004:0	As for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
1:17:005:0	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
1:17:006:0	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
1:17:007:0	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
1:17:008:0	And I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
1:17:009:0	And God said unto Abraham , Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee in their generations .
1:17:010:0	This is my covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy seed after thee ; Every man child among you shall be circumcised .
1:17:011:0	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you .
1:17:012:0	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
1:17:013:0	He that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
1:17:014:0	And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken my covenant .
1:17:015:0	And God said unto Abraham , As for Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall her name be .
1:17:016:0	And I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
1:17:017:0	Then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
1:17:018:0	And Abraham said unto God , O that Ishmael might live before thee !
1:17:019:0	And God said , Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
1:17:020:0	And as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : Behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
1:17:021:0	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
1:17:022:0	And he left off talking with him , and God went up from Abraham .
1:17:023:0	And Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham 's house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
1:17:024:0	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
1:17:025:0	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
1:17:026:0	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised , and Ishmael his son .
1:17:027:0	And all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
