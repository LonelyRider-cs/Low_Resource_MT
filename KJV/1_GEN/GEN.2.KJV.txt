1:2:001:0	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
1:2:002:0	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
1:2:003:0	And God blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .
1:2:004:0	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
1:2:005:0	And every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
1:2:006:0	But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
1:2:007:0	And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
1:2:008:0	And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
1:2:009:0	And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
1:2:010:0	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
1:2:011:0	The name of the first is Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
1:2:012:0	And the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
1:2:013:0	And the name of the second river is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
1:2:014:0	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria . And the fourth river is Euphrates .
1:2:015:0	And the Lord God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
1:2:016:0	And the Lord God commanded the man , saying , Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
1:2:017:0	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
1:2:018:0	And the Lord God said , It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help meet for him .
1:2:019:0	And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof .
1:2:020:0	And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him .
1:2:021:0	And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ;
1:2:022:0	And the rib , which the Lord God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
1:2:023:0	And Adam said , This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man .
1:2:024:0	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
1:2:025:0	And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
