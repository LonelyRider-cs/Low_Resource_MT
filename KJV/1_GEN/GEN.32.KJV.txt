1:32:001:0	And Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
1:32:002:0	And when Jacob saw them , he said , This is God's host : and he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
1:32:003:0	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir , the country of Edom .
1:32:004:0	And he commanded them , saying , Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau ; Thy servant Jacob saith thus , I have sojourned with Laban , and stayed there until now :
1:32:005:0	And I have oxen , and asses , flocks , and menservants , and womenservants : and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in thy sight .
1:32:006:0	And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , We came to thy brother Esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred men with him .
1:32:007:0	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
1:32:008:0	And said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
1:32:009:0	And Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the Lord which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee :
1:32:010:0	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
1:32:011:0	Deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
1:32:012:0	And thou saidst , I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbered for multitude .
1:32:013:0	And he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother ;
1:32:014:0	Two hundred she goats , and twenty he goats , two hundred ewes , and twenty rams ,
1:32:015:0	Thirty milch camels with their colts , forty kine , and ten bulls , twenty she asses , and ten foals .
1:32:016:0	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
1:32:017:0	And he commanded the foremost , saying , When Esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , Whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose are these before thee ?
1:32:018:0	Then thou shalt say , They be thy servant Jacob's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
1:32:019:0	And so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
1:32:020:0	And say ye moreover , Behold , thy servant Jacob is behind us . For he said , I will appease him with the present that goeth before me , and afterward I will see his face ; peradventure he will accept of me .
1:32:021:0	So went the present over before him : and himself lodged that night in the company .
1:32:022:0	And he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two womenservants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford Jabbok .
1:32:023:0	And he took them , and sent them over the brook , and sent over that he had .
1:32:024:0	And Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
1:32:025:0	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
1:32:026:0	And he said , Let me go , for the day breaketh . And he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
1:32:027:0	And he said unto him , What is thy name ? And he said , Jacob .
1:32:028:0	And he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
1:32:029:0	And Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . And he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? And he blessed him there .
1:32:030:0	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved .
1:32:031:0	And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him , and he halted upon his thigh .
1:32:032:0	Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank , which is upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank .
