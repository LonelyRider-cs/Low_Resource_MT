1:19:001:0	And there came two angels to Sodom at even ; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
1:19:002:0	And he said , Behold now , my lords , turn in , I pray you , into your servant's house , and tarry all night , and wash your feet , and ye shall rise up early , and go on your ways . And they said , Nay ; but we will abide in the street all night .
1:19:003:0	And he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bake unleavened bread , and they did eat .
1:19:004:0	But before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
1:19:005:0	And they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
1:19:006:0	And Lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him ,
1:19:007:0	And said , I pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
1:19:008:0	Behold now , I have two daughters which have not known man ; let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : only unto these men do nothing ; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof .
1:19:009:0	And they said , Stand back . And they said again , This one fellow came in to sojourn , and he will needs be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with them . And they pressed sore upon the man , even Lot , and came near to break the door .
1:19:010:0	But the men put forth their hand , and pulled Lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
1:19:011:0	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
1:19:012:0	And the men said unto Lot , Hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring them out of this place :
1:19:013:0	For we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord ; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it .
1:19:014:0	And Lot went out , and spake unto his sons in law , which married his daughters , and said , Up , get you out of this place ; for the Lord will destroy this city . But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law .
1:19:015:0	And when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
1:19:016:0	And while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the Lord being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
1:19:017:0	And it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
1:19:018:0	And Lot said unto them , Oh , not so , my Lord :
1:19:019:0	Behold now , thy servant hath found grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life ; and I cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and I die :
1:19:020:0	Behold now , this city is near to flee unto , and it is a little one : Oh , let me escape thither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
1:19:021:0	And he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
1:19:022:0	Haste thee , escape thither ; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither . Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar .
1:19:023:0	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar .
1:19:024:0	Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven ;
1:19:025:0	And he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
1:19:026:0	But his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
1:19:027:0	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord :
1:19:028:0	And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
1:19:029:0	And it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt .
1:19:030:0	And Lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
1:19:031:0	And the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
1:19:032:0	Come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
1:19:033:0	And they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
1:19:034:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn said unto the younger , Behold , I lay yesternight with my father : let us make him drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
1:19:035:0	And they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
1:19:036:0	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father .
1:19:037:0	And the firstborn bare a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
1:19:038:0	And the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Benâ€“ammi : the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
