1:24:001:0	And Abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things .
1:24:002:0	And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
1:24:003:0	And I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell :
1:24:004:0	But thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
1:24:005:0	And the servant said unto him , Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land : must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
1:24:006:0	And Abraham said unto him , Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
1:24:007:0	The Lord God of heaven , which took me from my father's house , and from the land of my kindred , and which spake unto me , and that sware unto me , saying , Unto thy seed will I give this land ; he shall send his angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence .
1:24:008:0	And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
1:24:009:0	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter .
1:24:010:0	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
1:24:011:0	And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
1:24:012:0	And he said , O Lord God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master Abraham .
1:24:013:0	Behold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
1:24:014:0	And let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom I shall say , Let down thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drink ; and she shall say , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac ; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master .
1:24:015:0	And it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham's brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
1:24:016:0	And the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
1:24:017:0	And the servant ran to meet her , and said , Let me , I pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
1:24:018:0	And she said , Drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
1:24:019:0	And when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
1:24:020:0	And she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
1:24:021:0	And the man wondering at her held his peace , to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
1:24:022:0	And it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
1:24:023:0	And said , Whose daughter art thou ? tell me , I pray thee : is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in ?
1:24:024:0	And she said unto him , I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , which she bare unto Nahor .
1:24:025:0	She said moreover unto him , We have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
1:24:026:0	And the man bowed down his head , and worshipped the Lord .
1:24:027:0	And he said , Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth : I being in the way , the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren .
1:24:028:0	And the damsel ran , and told them of her mother's house these things .
1:24:029:0	And Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
1:24:030:0	And it came to pass , when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands , and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister , saying , Thus spake the man unto me ; that he came unto the man ; and , behold , he stood by the camels at the well .
1:24:031:0	And he said , Come in , thou blessed of the Lord ; wherefore standest thou without ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
1:24:032:0	And the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the men's feet that were with him .
1:24:033:0	And there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine errand . And he said , Speak on .
1:24:034:0	And he said , I am Abraham's servant .
1:24:035:0	And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
1:24:036:0	And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
1:24:037:0	And my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell :
1:24:038:0	But thou shalt go unto my father's house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
1:24:039:0	And I said unto my master , Peradventure the woman will not follow me .
1:24:040:0	And he said unto me , The Lord , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father's house :
1:24:041:0	Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
1:24:042:0	And I came this day unto the well , and said , O Lord God of my master Abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which I go :
1:24:043:0	Behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and I say to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
1:24:044:0	And she say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master's son .
1:24:045:0	And before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
1:24:046:0	And she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
1:24:047:0	And I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ? And she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor's son , whom Milcah bare unto him : and I put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
1:24:048:0	And I bowed down my head , and worshipped the Lord , and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son .
1:24:049:0	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
1:24:050:0	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said , The thing proceedeth from the Lord : we cannot speak unto thee bad or good .
1:24:051:0	Behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be thy master's son's wife , as the Lord hath spoken .
1:24:052:0	And it came to pass , that , when Abraham's servant heard their words , he worshipped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth .
1:24:053:0	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
1:24:054:0	And they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tarried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , Send me away unto my master .
1:24:055:0	And her brother and her mother said , Let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
1:24:056:0	And he said unto them , Hinder me not , seeing the Lord hath prospered my way ; send me away that I may go to my master .
1:24:057:0	And they said , We will call the damsel , and enquire at her mouth .
1:24:058:0	And they called Rebekah , and said unto her , Wilt thou go with this man ? And she said , I will go .
1:24:059:0	And they sent away Rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and Abraham's servant , and his men .
1:24:060:0	And they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
1:24:061:0	And Rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man : and the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
1:24:062:0	And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahaiâ€“roi ; for he dwelt in the south country .
1:24:063:0	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
1:24:064:0	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she lighted off the camel .
1:24:065:0	For she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? And the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a veil , and covered herself .
1:24:066:0	And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done .
1:24:067:0	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent , and took Rebekah , and she became his wife ; and he loved her : and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death .
