1:27:001:0	And it came to pass , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his eldest son , and said unto him , My son : and he said unto him , Behold , here am I .
1:27:002:0	And he said , Behold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death :
1:27:003:0	Now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
1:27:004:0	And make me savoury meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
1:27:005:0	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son . And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
1:27:006:0	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son , saying , Behold , I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother , saying ,
1:27:007:0	Bring me venison , and make me savoury meat , that I may eat , and bless thee before the before my death .
1:27:008:0	Now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
1:27:009:0	Go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
1:27:010:0	And thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
1:27:011:0	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man :
1:27:012:0	My father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
1:27:013:0	And his mother said unto him , Upon me be thy curse , my son : only obey my voice , and go fetch me them .
1:27:014:0	And he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savoury meat , such as his father loved .
1:27:015:0	And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jacob her younger son :
1:27:016:0	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
1:27:017:0	And she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
1:27:018:0	And he came unto his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I ; who art thou , my son ?
1:27:019:0	And Jacob said unto his father , I am Esau thy firstborn ; I have done according as thou badest me : arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
1:27:020:0	And Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? And he said , Because the thy God brought it to me .
1:27:021:0	And Isaac said unto Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Esau or not .
1:27:022:0	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
1:27:023:0	And he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau 's hands : so he blessed him .
1:27:024:0	And he said , Art thou my very son Esau ? And he said , I am .
1:27:025:0	And he said , Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless thee . And he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he drank .
1:27:026:0	And his father Isaac said unto him , Come near now , and kiss me , my son .
1:27:027:0	And he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the hath blessed :
1:27:028:0	Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
1:27:029:0	Let people serve thee , and nations bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother 's sons bow down to thee : cursed be every one that curseth thee , and blessed be he that blesseth thee .
1:27:030:0	And it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
1:27:031:0	And he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that thy soul may bless me .
1:27:032:0	And Isaac his father said unto him , Who art thou ? And he said , I am thy son , thy firstborn Esau .
1:27:033:0	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly , and said , Who ? where is he that hath taken venison , and brought it me , and I have eaten of all before thou camest , and have blessed him ? yea , and he shall be blessed .
1:27:034:0	And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
1:27:035:0	And he said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away thy blessing .
1:27:036:0	And he said , Is not he rightly named Jacob ? for he hath supplanted me these two times : he took away my birthright ; and , behold , now he hath taken away my blessing . And he said , Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ?
1:27:037:0	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
1:27:038:0	And Esau said unto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . And Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
1:27:039:0	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
1:27:040:0	And by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
1:27:041:0	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him : and Esau said in his heart , The days of mourning for my father are at hand ; then will I slay my brother Jacob .
1:27:042:0	And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , Behold , thy brother Esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
1:27:043:0	Now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran ;
1:27:044:0	And tarry with him a few days , until thy brother 's fury turn away ;
1:27:045:0	Until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him : then I will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should I be deprived also of you both in one day ?
1:27:046:0	And Rebekah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
