43:6:001:0	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias .
43:6:002:0	And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
43:6:003:0	And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
43:6:004:0	And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
43:6:005:0	When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
43:6:006:0	And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
43:6:007:0	Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
43:6:008:0	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , saith unto him ,
43:6:009:0	There is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
43:6:010:0	And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
43:6:011:0	And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
43:6:012:0	When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
43:6:013:0	Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
43:6:014:0	Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
43:6:015:0	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
43:6:016:0	And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
43:6:017:0	And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
43:6:018:0	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
43:6:019:0	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
43:6:020:0	But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid .
43:6:021:0	Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
43:6:022:0	The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
43:6:023:0	( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
43:6:024:0	When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
43:6:025:0	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
43:6:026:0	Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
43:6:027:0	Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .
43:6:028:0	Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ?
43:6:029:0	Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
43:6:030:0	They said therefore unto him , What sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
43:6:031:0	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
43:6:032:0	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
43:6:033:0	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
43:6:034:0	Then said they unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread .
43:6:035:0	And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
43:6:036:0	But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
43:6:037:0	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
43:6:038:0	For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
43:6:039:0	And this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
43:6:040:0	And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
43:6:041:0	The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven .
43:6:042:0	And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ?
43:6:043:0	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
43:6:044:0	No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
43:6:045:0	It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
43:6:046:0	Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
43:6:047:0	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
43:6:048:0	I am that bread of life .
43:6:049:0	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
43:6:050:0	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
43:6:051:0	I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
43:6:052:0	The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
43:6:053:0	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
43:6:054:0	Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
43:6:055:0	For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
43:6:056:0	He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
43:6:057:0	As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
43:6:058:0	This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
43:6:059:0	These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
43:6:060:0	Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
43:6:061:0	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , Doth this offend you ?
43:6:062:0	What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
43:6:063:0	It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
43:6:064:0	But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
43:6:065:0	And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my Father .
43:6:066:0	From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
43:6:067:0	Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
43:6:068:0	Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
43:6:069:0	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God .
43:6:070:0	Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
43:6:071:0	He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
