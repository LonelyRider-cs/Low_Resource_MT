43:19:001:0	Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him .
43:19:002:0	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
43:19:003:0	And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
43:19:004:0	Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
43:19:005:0	Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
43:19:006:0	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
43:19:007:0	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
43:19:008:0	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
43:19:009:0	And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
43:19:010:0	Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
43:19:011:0	Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
43:19:012:0	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar 's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
43:19:013:0	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
43:19:014:0	And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
43:19:015:0	But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
43:19:016:0	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away .
43:19:017:0	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :
43:19:018:0	Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
43:19:019:0	And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was , JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS .
43:19:020:0	This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
43:19:021:0	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews .
43:19:022:0	Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
43:19:023:0	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
43:19:024:0	They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did .
43:19:025:0	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
43:19:026:0	When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
43:19:027:0	Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
43:19:028:0	After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
43:19:029:0	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a sponge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
43:19:030:0	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
43:19:031:0	The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
43:19:032:0	Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
43:19:033:0	But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
43:19:034:0	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
43:19:035:0	And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
43:19:036:0	For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken .
43:19:037:0	And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced .
43:19:038:0	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
43:19:039:0	And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
43:19:040:0	Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
43:19:041:0	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
43:19:042:0	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
