43:1:001:0	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43:1:002:0	The same was in the beginning with God .
43:1:003:0	All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
43:1:004:0	In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
43:1:005:0	And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
43:1:006:0	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
43:1:007:0	The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
43:1:008:0	He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
43:1:009:0	That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
43:1:010:0	He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
43:1:011:0	He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
43:1:012:0	But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
43:1:013:0	Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
43:1:014:0	And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
43:1:015:0	John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
43:1:016:0	And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
43:1:017:0	For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
43:1:018:0	No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
43:1:019:0	And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
43:1:020:0	And he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , I am not the Christ .
43:1:021:0	And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No .
43:1:022:0	Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ?
43:1:023:0	He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Esaias .
43:1:024:0	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees .
43:1:025:0	And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
43:1:026:0	John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ;
43:1:027:0	He it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe 's latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
43:1:028:0	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43:1:029:0	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
43:1:030:0	This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
43:1:031:0	And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
43:1:032:0	And John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
43:1:033:0	And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost .
43:1:034:0	And I saw , and bare record that this is the Son of God .
43:1:035:0	Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ;
43:1:036:0	And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God !
43:1:037:0	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
43:1:038:0	Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? They said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
43:1:039:0	He saith unto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
43:1:040:0	One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
43:1:041:0	He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
43:1:042:0	And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
43:1:043:0	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me .
43:1:044:0	Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
43:1:045:0	Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
43:1:046:0	And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see .
43:1:047:0	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
43:1:048:0	Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
43:1:049:0	Nathanael answered and saith unto him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel .
43:1:050:0	Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
43:1:051:0	And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
