43:12:001:0	Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
43:12:002:0	There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
43:12:003:0	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
43:12:004:0	Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , which should betray him ,
43:12:005:0	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
43:12:006:0	This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
43:12:007:0	Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
43:12:008:0	For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
43:12:009:0	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
43:12:010:0	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
43:12:011:0	Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
43:12:012:0	On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
43:12:013:0	Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
43:12:014:0	And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
43:12:015:0	Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt .
43:12:016:0	These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
43:12:017:0	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
43:12:018:0	For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
43:12:019:0	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
43:12:020:0	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
43:12:021:0	The same came therefore to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus .
43:12:022:0	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
43:12:023:0	And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
43:12:024:0	Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
43:12:025:0	He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
43:12:026:0	If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
43:12:027:0	Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour .
43:12:028:0	Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
43:12:029:0	The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him .
43:12:030:0	Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
43:12:031:0	Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
43:12:032:0	And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
43:12:033:0	This he said , signifying what death he should die .
43:12:034:0	The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
43:12:035:0	Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
43:12:036:0	While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
43:12:037:0	But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
43:12:038:0	That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
43:12:039:0	Therefore they could not believe , because that Esaias said again ,
43:12:040:0	He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
43:12:041:0	These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
43:12:042:0	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
43:12:043:0	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
43:12:044:0	Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
43:12:045:0	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
43:12:046:0	I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
43:12:047:0	And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
43:12:048:0	He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
43:12:049:0	For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
43:12:050:0	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said unto me , so I speak .
