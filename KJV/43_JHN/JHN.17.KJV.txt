43:17:001:0	These words spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee :
43:17:002:0	As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
43:17:003:0	And this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .
43:17:004:0	I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
43:17:005:0	And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
43:17:006:0	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
43:17:007:0	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
43:17:008:0	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
43:17:009:0	I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
43:17:010:0	And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
43:17:011:0	And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
43:17:012:0	While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
43:17:013:0	And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
43:17:014:0	I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43:17:015:0	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
43:17:016:0	They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43:17:017:0	Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
43:17:018:0	As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
43:17:019:0	And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
43:17:020:0	Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ;
43:17:021:0	That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
43:17:022:0	And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
43:17:023:0	I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
43:17:024:0	Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
43:17:025:0	O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
43:17:026:0	And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
