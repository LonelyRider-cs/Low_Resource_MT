43:20:001:0	The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
43:20:002:0	Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
43:20:003:0	Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
43:20:004:0	So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
43:20:005:0	And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
43:20:006:0	Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
43:20:007:0	And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
43:20:008:0	Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
43:20:009:0	For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
43:20:010:0	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
43:20:011:0	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
43:20:012:0	And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
43:20:013:0	And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
43:20:014:0	And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
43:20:015:0	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
43:20:016:0	Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turned herself , and saith unto him , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master .
43:20:017:0	Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
43:20:018:0	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
43:20:019:0	Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
43:20:020:0	And when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
43:20:021:0	Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
43:20:022:0	And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Ghost :
43:20:023:0	Whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
43:20:024:0	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
43:20:025:0	The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe .
43:20:026:0	And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
43:20:027:0	Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
43:20:028:0	And Thomas answered and said unto him , My Lord and my God .
43:20:029:0	Jesus saith unto him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
43:20:030:0	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
43:20:031:0	But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
