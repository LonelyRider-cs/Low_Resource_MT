43:4:001:0	When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John ,
43:4:002:0	( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , )
43:4:003:0	He left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee .
43:4:004:0	And he must needs go through Samaria .
43:4:005:0	Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43:4:006:0	Now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
43:4:007:0	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
43:4:008:0	( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
43:4:009:0	Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans .
43:4:010:0	Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
43:4:011:0	The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
43:4:012:0	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
43:4:013:0	Jesus answered and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
43:4:014:0	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
43:4:015:0	The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
43:4:016:0	Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
43:4:017:0	The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband :
43:4:018:0	For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
43:4:019:0	The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
43:4:020:0	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
43:4:021:0	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
43:4:022:0	Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
43:4:023:0	But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
43:4:024:0	God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
43:4:025:0	The woman saith unto him , I know that Messias cometh , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
43:4:026:0	Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he .
43:4:027:0	And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ?
43:4:028:0	The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
43:4:029:0	Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ?
43:4:030:0	Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
43:4:031:0	In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat .
43:4:032:0	But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not of .
43:4:033:0	Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
43:4:034:0	Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
43:4:035:0	Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
43:4:036:0	And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
43:4:037:0	And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth .
43:4:038:0	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
43:4:039:0	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
43:4:040:0	So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
43:4:041:0	And many more believed because of his own word ;
43:4:042:0	And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
43:4:043:0	Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
43:4:044:0	For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
43:4:045:0	Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
43:4:046:0	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
43:4:047:0	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
43:4:048:0	Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
43:4:049:0	The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
43:4:050:0	Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
43:4:051:0	And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
43:4:052:0	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
43:4:053:0	So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
43:4:054:0	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee .
