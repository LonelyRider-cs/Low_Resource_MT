43:16:001:0	These things have I spoken unto you , that ye should not be offended .
43:16:002:0	They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
43:16:003:0	And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
43:16:004:0	But these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . And these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
43:16:005:0	But now I go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
43:16:006:0	But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
43:16:007:0	Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
43:16:008:0	And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
43:16:009:0	Of sin , because they believe not on me ;
43:16:010:0	Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ;
43:16:011:0	Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
43:16:012:0	I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
43:16:013:0	Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
43:16:014:0	He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
43:16:015:0	All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
43:16:016:0	A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
43:16:017:0	Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
43:16:018:0	They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we can not tell what he saith .
43:16:019:0	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
43:16:020:0	Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
43:16:021:0	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
43:16:022:0	And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
43:16:023:0	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
43:16:024:0	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
43:16:025:0	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
43:16:026:0	At that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you :
43:16:027:0	For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
43:16:028:0	I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
43:16:029:0	His disciples said unto him , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb .
43:16:030:0	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
43:16:031:0	Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ?
43:16:032:0	Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
43:16:033:0	These things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . In the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world .
