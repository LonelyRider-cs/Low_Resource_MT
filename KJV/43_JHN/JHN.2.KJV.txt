43:2:001:0	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
43:2:002:0	And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
43:2:003:0	And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine .
43:2:004:0	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
43:2:005:0	His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
43:2:006:0	And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
43:2:007:0	Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
43:2:008:0	And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . And they bare it .
43:2:009:0	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
43:2:010:0	And saith unto him , Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
43:2:011:0	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
43:2:012:0	After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
43:2:013:0	And the Jews' passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem ,
43:2:014:0	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
43:2:015:0	And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers' money , and overthrew the tables ;
43:2:016:0	And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise .
43:2:017:0	And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
43:2:018:0	Then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
43:2:019:0	Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
43:2:020:0	Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
43:2:021:0	But he spake of the temple of his body .
43:2:022:0	When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
43:2:023:0	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
43:2:024:0	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
43:2:025:0	And needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
