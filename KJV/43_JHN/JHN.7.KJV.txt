43:7:001:0	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him .
43:7:002:0	Now the Jews ' feast of tabernacles was at hand .
43:7:003:0	His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
43:7:004:0	For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
43:7:005:0	For neither did his brethren believe in him .
43:7:006:0	Then Jesus said unto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
43:7:007:0	The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
43:7:008:0	Go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast ; for my time is not yet full come .
43:7:009:0	When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
43:7:010:0	But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
43:7:011:0	Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
43:7:012:0	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
43:7:013:0	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
43:7:014:0	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
43:7:015:0	And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
43:7:016:0	Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
43:7:017:0	If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
43:7:018:0	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
43:7:019:0	Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ?
43:7:020:0	The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
43:7:021:0	Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
43:7:022:0	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
43:7:023:0	If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
43:7:024:0	Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
43:7:025:0	Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
43:7:026:0	But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
43:7:027:0	Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
43:7:028:0	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
43:7:029:0	But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me .
43:7:030:0	Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
43:7:031:0	And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
43:7:032:0	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
43:7:033:0	Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
43:7:034:0	Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come .
43:7:035:0	Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
43:7:036:0	What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ?
43:7:037:0	In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
43:7:038:0	He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
43:7:039:0	( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
43:7:040:0	Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet .
43:7:041:0	Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
43:7:042:0	Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ?
43:7:043:0	So there was a division among the people because of him .
43:7:044:0	And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
43:7:045:0	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ?
43:7:046:0	The officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
43:7:047:0	Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceived ?
43:7:048:0	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
43:7:049:0	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed .
43:7:050:0	Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , )
43:7:051:0	Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
43:7:052:0	They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .
43:7:053:0	And every man went unto his own house .
