30:6:001:0	Woe to them that are at ease in Zion , and trust in the mountain of Samaria , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel came !
30:6:002:0	Pass ye unto Calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great : then go down to Gath of the Philistines : be they better than these kingdoms ? or their border greater than your border ?
30:6:003:0	Ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
30:6:004:0	That lie upon beds of ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
30:6:005:0	That chant to the sound of the viol , and invent to themselves instruments of musick , like David ;
30:6:006:0	That drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief ointments : but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
30:6:007:0	Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive , and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed .
30:6:008:0	The Lord God hath sworn by himself , saith the Lord the God of hosts , I abhor the excellency of Jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein .
30:6:009:0	And it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
30:6:010:0	And a man's uncle shall take him up , and he that burneth him , to bring out the bones out of the house , and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house , Is there yet any with thee ? and he shall say , No . Then shall he say , Hold thy tongue : for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord .
30:6:011:0	For , behold , the Lord commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
30:6:012:0	Shall horses run upon the rock ? will one plow there with oxen ? for ye have turned judgment into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock :
30:6:013:0	Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought , which say , Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength ?
30:6:014:0	But , behold , I will raise up against you a nation , O house of Israel , saith the Lord the God of hosts ; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness .
