30:2:001:0	Thus saith the ; For three transgressions of Moab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime :
30:2:002:0	But I will send a fire upon Moab , and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth : and Moab shall die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet :
30:2:003:0	And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , saith the .
30:2:004:0	Thus saith the ; For three transgressions of Judah , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have despised the law of the , and have not kept his commandments , and their lies caused them to err , after the which their fathers have walked :
30:2:005:0	But I will send a fire upon Judah , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem .
30:2:006:0	Thus saith the ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
30:2:007:0	That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
30:2:008:0	And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar , and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god .
30:2:009:0	Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
30:2:010:0	Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
30:2:011:0	And I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazarites . Is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? saith the .
30:2:012:0	But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink ; and commanded the prophets , saying , Prophesy not .
30:2:013:0	Behold , I am pressed under you , as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves .
30:2:014:0	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the mighty deliver himself :
30:2:015:0	Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
30:2:016:0	And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith the .
