61:3:001:0	This second epistle , beloved , I now write unto you ; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance :
61:3:002:0	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
61:3:003:0	Knowing this first , that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts ,
61:3:004:0	And saying , Where is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
61:3:005:0	For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
61:3:006:0	Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
61:3:007:0	But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
61:3:008:0	But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
61:3:009:0	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us-ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
61:3:010:0	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
61:3:011:0	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
61:3:012:0	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
61:3:013:0	Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
61:3:014:0	Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
61:3:015:0	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
61:3:016:0	As also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction .
61:3:017:0	Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
61:3:018:0	But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
