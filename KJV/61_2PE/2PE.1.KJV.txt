61:1:001:0	Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
61:1:002:0	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
61:1:003:0	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
61:1:004:0	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
61:1:005:0	And beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ;
61:1:006:0	And to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience godliness ;
61:1:007:0	And to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness charity .
61:1:008:0	For if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61:1:009:0	But he that lacketh these things is blind , and can not see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
61:1:010:0	Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
61:1:011:0	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
61:1:012:0	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
61:1:013:0	Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
61:1:014:0	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
61:1:015:0	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
61:1:016:0	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
61:1:017:0	For he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
61:1:018:0	And this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
61:1:019:0	We have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts :
61:1:020:0	Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
61:1:021:0	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
