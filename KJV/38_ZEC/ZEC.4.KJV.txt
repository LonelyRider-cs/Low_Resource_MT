38:4:001:0	And the angel that talked with me came again , and waked me , as a man that is wakened out of his sleep ,
38:4:002:0	And said unto me , What seest thou ? And I said , I have looked , and behold a candlestick all of gold , with a bowl upon the top of it , and his seven lamps thereon , and seven pipes to the seven lamps , which are upon the top thereof :
38:4:003:0	And two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
38:4:004:0	So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me , saying , What are these , my lord ?
38:4:005:0	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me , Knowest thou not what these be ? And I said , No , my lord .
38:4:006:0	Then he answered and spake unto me , saying , This is the word of the unto Zerubbabel , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the of hosts .
38:4:007:0	Who art thou , O great mountain ? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain : and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings , crying , Grace , grace unto it .
38:4:008:0	Moreover the word of the came unto me , saying ,
38:4:009:0	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the of hosts hath sent me unto you .
38:4:010:0	For who hath despised the day of small things ? for they shall rejoice , and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven ; they are the eyes of the , which run to and fro through the whole earth .
38:4:011:0	Then answered I , and said unto him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
38:4:012:0	And I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
38:4:013:0	And he answered me and said , Knowest thou not what these be ? And I said , No , my lord .
38:4:014:0	Then said he , These are the two anointed ones , that stand by the Lord of the whole earth .
