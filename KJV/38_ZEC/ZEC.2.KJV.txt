38:2:001:0	I lifted up mine eyes again , and looked , and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand .
38:2:002:0	Then said I , Whither goest thou ? And he said unto me , To measure Jerusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
38:2:003:0	And , behold , the angel that talked with me went forth , and another angel went out to meet him ,
38:2:004:0	And said unto him , Run , speak to this young man , saying , Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein :
38:2:005:0	For I , saith the Lord , will be unto her a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of her .
38:2:006:0	Ho , ho , come forth , and flee from the land of the north , saith the Lord : for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven , saith the Lord .
38:2:007:0	Deliver thyself , O Zion , that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon .
38:2:008:0	For thus saith the Lord of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
38:2:009:0	For , behold , I will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me .
38:2:010:0	Sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion : for , lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the Lord .
38:2:011:0	And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
38:2:012:0	And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land , and shall choose Jerusalem again .
38:2:013:0	Be silent , O all flesh , before the Lord : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation .
