38:8:001:0	Again the word of the of hosts came to me , saying ,
38:8:002:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I was jealous for her with great fury .
38:8:003:0	Thus saith the ; I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the of hosts the holy mountain .
38:8:004:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
38:8:005:0	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof .
38:8:006:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days , should it also be marvellous in mine eyes ? saith the of hosts .
38:8:007:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; Behold , I will save my people from the east country , and from the west country ;
38:8:008:0	And I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness .
38:8:009:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; Let your hands be strong , ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets , which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the of hosts was laid , that the temple might be built .
38:8:010:0	For before these days there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction : for I set all men every one against his neighbour .
38:8:011:0	But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days , saith the of hosts .
38:8:012:0	For the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
38:8:013:0	And it shall come to pass , that as ye were a curse among the heathen , O house of Judah , and house of Israel ; so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let your hands be strong .
38:8:014:0	For thus saith the of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith the of hosts , and I repented not :
38:8:015:0	So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah : fear ye not .
38:8:016:0	These are the things that ye shall do ; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
38:8:017:0	And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are things that I hate , saith the .
38:8:018:0	And the word of the of hosts came unto me , saying ,
38:8:019:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; The fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth , and the fast of the seventh , and the fast of the tenth , shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness , and cheerful feasts ; therefore love the truth and peace .
38:8:020:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; It shall yet come to pass , that there shall come people , and the inhabitants of many cities :
38:8:021:0	And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go speedily to pray before the , and to seek the of hosts : I will go also .
38:8:022:0	Yea , many people and strong nations shall come to seek the of hosts in Jerusalem , and to pray before the .
38:8:023:0	Thus saith the of hosts ; In those days it shall come to pass , that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations , even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew , saying , We will go with you : for we have heard that God is with you .
