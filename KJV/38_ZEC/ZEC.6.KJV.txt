38:6:001:0	And I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four chariots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
38:6:002:0	In the first chariot were red horses ; and in the second chariot black horses ;
38:6:003:0	And in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses .
38:6:004:0	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me , What are these , my lord ?
38:6:005:0	And the angel answered and said unto me , These are the four spirits of the heavens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
38:6:006:0	The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after them ; and the grisled go forth toward the south country .
38:6:007:0	And the bay went forth , and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth : and he said , Get you hence , walk to and fro through the earth . So they walked to and fro through the earth .
38:6:008:0	Then cried he upon me , and spake unto me , saying , Behold , these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country .
38:6:009:0	And the word of the came unto me , saying ,
38:6:010:0	Take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah ;
38:6:011:0	Then take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest ;
38:6:012:0	And speak unto him , saying , Thus speaketh the of hosts , saying , Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temple of the :
38:6:013:0	Even he shall build the temple of the ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
38:6:014:0	And the crowns shall be to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the .
38:6:015:0	And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the , and ye shall know that the of hosts hath sent me unto you . And this shall come to pass , if ye will diligently obey the voice of the your God .
