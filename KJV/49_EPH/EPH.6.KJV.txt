49:6:001:0	Children , obey your parents in the Lord : for this is right .
49:6:002:0	Honour thy father and mother ; ( which is the first commandment with promise ; )
49:6:003:0	That it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
49:6:004:0	And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
49:6:005:0	Servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
49:6:006:0	Not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ;
49:6:007:0	With good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men :
49:6:008:0	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
49:6:009:0	And , ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening : knowing that your Master also is in heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with him .
49:6:010:0	Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
49:6:011:0	Put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
49:6:012:0	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
49:6:013:0	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
49:6:014:0	Stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ;
49:6:015:0	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
49:6:016:0	Above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
49:6:017:0	And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
49:6:018:0	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ;
49:6:019:0	And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel ,
49:6:020:0	For which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
49:6:021:0	But that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
49:6:022:0	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
49:6:023:0	Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49:6:024:0	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity . Amen .
