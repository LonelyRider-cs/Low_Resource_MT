49:2:001:0	And you hath he quickened , who were dead in trespasses and sins ;
49:2:002:0	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
49:2:003:0	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
49:2:004:0	But God , who is rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
49:2:005:0	Even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
49:2:006:0	And hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus :
49:2:007:0	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
49:2:008:0	For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
49:2:009:0	Not of works , lest any man should boast .
49:2:010:0	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
49:2:011:0	Wherefore remember , that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands ;
49:2:012:0	That at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
49:2:013:0	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ .
49:2:014:0	For he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
49:2:015:0	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
49:2:016:0	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
49:2:017:0	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off , and to them that were nigh .
49:2:018:0	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father .
49:2:019:0	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellowcitizens with the saints , and of the household of God ;
49:2:020:0	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
49:2:021:0	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord :
49:2:022:0	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit .
