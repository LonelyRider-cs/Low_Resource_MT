49:4:001:0	I therefore , the prisoner of the Lord , beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called ,
49:4:002:0	With all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
49:4:003:0	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49:4:004:0	There is one body , and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ;
49:4:005:0	One Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49:4:006:0	One God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
49:4:007:0	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
49:4:008:0	Wherefore he saith , When he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
49:4:009:0	( Now that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
49:4:010:0	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things . )
49:4:011:0	And he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
49:4:012:0	For the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
49:4:013:0	Till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
49:4:014:0	That we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
49:4:015:0	But speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Christ :
49:4:016:0	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
49:4:017:0	This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
49:4:018:0	Having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
49:4:019:0	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
49:4:020:0	But ye have not so learned Christ ;
49:4:021:0	If so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in Jesus :
49:4:022:0	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ;
49:4:023:0	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind ;
49:4:024:0	And that ye put on the new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness .
49:4:025:0	Wherefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
49:4:026:0	Be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wrath :
49:4:027:0	Neither give place to the devil .
49:4:028:0	Let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
49:4:029:0	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
49:4:030:0	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
49:4:031:0	Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice :
49:4:032:0	And be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as God for Christ 's sake hath forgiven you .
