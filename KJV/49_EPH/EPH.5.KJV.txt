49:5:001:0	Be ye therefore followers of God , as dear children ;
49:5:002:0	And walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour .
49:5:003:0	But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ;
49:5:004:0	Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .
49:5:005:0	For this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49:5:006:0	Let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
49:5:007:0	Be not ye therefore partakers with them .
49:5:008:0	For ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
49:5:009:0	( For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
49:5:010:0	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord .
49:5:011:0	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
49:5:012:0	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
49:5:013:0	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
49:5:014:0	Wherefore he saith , Awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light .
49:5:015:0	See then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise ,
49:5:016:0	Redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
49:5:017:0	Wherefore be ye not unwise , but understanding what the will of the Lord is .
49:5:018:0	And be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the Spirit ;
49:5:019:0	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
49:5:020:0	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
49:5:021:0	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
49:5:022:0	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
49:5:023:0	For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
49:5:024:0	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
49:5:025:0	Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
49:5:026:0	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word ,
49:5:027:0	That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
49:5:028:0	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
49:5:029:0	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church :
49:5:030:0	For we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
49:5:031:0	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
49:5:032:0	This is a great mystery : but I speak concerning Christ and the church .
49:5:033:0	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
