33:2:001:0	Woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
33:2:002:0	And they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
33:2:003:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold , against this family do I devise an evil , from which ye shall not remove your necks ; neither shall ye go haughtily : for this time is evil .
33:2:004:0	In that day shall one take up a parable against you , and lament with a doleful lamentation , and say , We be utterly spoiled : he hath changed the portion of my people : how hath he removed it from me ! turning away he hath divided our fields .
33:2:005:0	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord .
33:2:006:0	Prophesy ye not , say they to them that prophesy : they shall not prophesy to them , that they shall not take shame .
33:2:007:0	O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the Lord straitened ? are these his doings ? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
33:2:008:0	Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war .
33:2:009:0	The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
33:2:010:0	Arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
33:2:011:0	If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie , saying , I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink ; he shall even be the prophet of this people .
33:2:012:0	I will surely assemble , O Jacob , all of thee ; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel ; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah , as the flock in the midst of their fold : they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men .
33:2:013:0	The breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
