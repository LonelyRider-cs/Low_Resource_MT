33:7:001:0	Woe is me ! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits , as the grapegleanings of the vintage : there is no cluster to eat : my soul desired the firstripe fruit .
33:7:002:0	The good man is perished out of the earth : and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
33:7:003:0	That they may do evil with both hands earnestly , the prince asketh , and the judge asketh for a reward ; and the great man , he uttereth his mischievous desire : so they wrap it up .
33:7:004:0	The best of them is as a brier : the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge : the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh ; now shall be their perplexity .
33:7:005:0	Trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom .
33:7:006:0	For the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man's enemies are the men of his own house .
33:7:007:0	Therefore I will look unto the Lord ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
33:7:008:0	Rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the Lord shall be a light unto me .
33:7:009:0	I will bear the indignation of the Lord , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
33:7:010:0	Then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , Where is the Lord thy God ? mine eyes shall behold her : now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets .
33:7:011:0	In the day that thy walls are to be built , in that day shall the decree be far removed .
33:7:012:0	In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
33:7:013:0	Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
33:7:014:0	Feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of Carmel : let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old .
33:7:015:0	According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things .
33:7:016:0	The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
33:7:017:0	They shall lick the dust like a serpent , they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth : they shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall fear because of thee .
33:7:018:0	Who is a God like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? he retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy .
33:7:019:0	He will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
33:7:020:0	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob , and the mercy to Abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
