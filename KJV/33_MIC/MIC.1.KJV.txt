33:1:001:0	The word of the that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
33:1:002:0	Hear , all ye people ; hearken , O earth , and all that therein is : and let the Lord be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
33:1:003:0	For , behold , the cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
33:1:004:0	And the mountains shall be molten under him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as the waters that are poured down a steep place .
33:1:005:0	For the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . What is the transgression of Jacob ? is it not Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? are they not Jerusalem ?
33:1:006:0	Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard : and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and I will discover the foundations thereof .
33:1:007:0	And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces , and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire , and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate : for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot , and they shall return to the hire of an harlot .
33:1:008:0	Therefore I will wail and howl , I will go stripped and naked : I will make a wailing like the dragons , and mourning as the owls .
33:1:009:0	For her wound is incurable ; for it is come unto Judah ; he is come unto the gate of my people , even to Jerusalem .
33:1:010:0	Declare ye it not at Gath , weep ye not at all : in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust .
33:1:011:0	Pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Saphir , having thy shame naked : the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth–ezel ; he shall receive of you his standing .
33:1:012:0	For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good : but evil came down from the unto the gate of Jerusalem .
33:1:013:0	O thou inhabitant of Lachish , bind the chariot to the swift beast : she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion : for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee .
33:1:014:0	Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth–gath : the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel .
33:1:015:0	Yet will I bring an heir unto thee , O inhabitant of Mareshah : he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel .
33:1:016:0	Make thee bald , and poll thee for thy delicate children ; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle ; for they are gone into captivity from thee .
