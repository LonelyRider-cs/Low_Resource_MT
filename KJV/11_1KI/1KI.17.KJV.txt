11:17:001:0	And Elijah the Tishbite , who was of the inhabitants of Gilead , said unto Ahab , As the Lord God of Israel liveth , before whom I stand , there shall not be dew nor rain these years , but according to my word .
11:17:002:0	And the word of the Lord came unto him , saying ,
11:17:003:0	Get thee hence , and turn thee eastward , and hide thyself by the brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
11:17:004:0	And it shall be , that thou shalt drink of the brook ; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there .
11:17:005:0	So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord : for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
11:17:006:0	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the brook .
11:17:007:0	And it came to pass after a while , that the brook dried up , because there had been no rain in the land .
11:17:008:0	And the word of the Lord came unto him , saying ,
11:17:009:0	Arise , get thee to Zarephath , which belongeth to Zidon , and dwell there : behold , I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee .
11:17:010:0	So he arose and went to Zarephath . And when he came to the gate of the city , behold , the widow woman was there gathering of sticks : and he called to her , and said , Fetch me , I pray thee , a little water in a vessel , that I may drink .
11:17:011:0	And as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
11:17:012:0	And she said , As the Lord thy God liveth , I have not a cake , but an handful of meal in a barrel , and a little oil in a cruse : and , behold , I am gathering two sticks , that I may go in and dress it for me and my son , that we may eat it , and die .
11:17:013:0	And Elijah said unto her , Fear not ; go and do as thou hast said : but make me thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto me , and after make for thee and for thy son .
11:17:014:0	For thus saith the Lord God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth .
11:17:015:0	And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
11:17:016:0	And the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Elijah .
11:17:017:0	And it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
11:17:018:0	And she said unto Elijah , What have I to do with thee , O thou man of God ? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance , and to slay my son ?
11:17:019:0	And he said unto her , Give me thy son . And he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft , where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
11:17:020:0	And he cried unto the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn , by slaying her son ?
11:17:021:0	And he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried unto the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , I pray thee , let this child's soul come into him again .
11:17:022:0	And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
11:17:023:0	And Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , thy son liveth .
11:17:024:0	And the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth .
