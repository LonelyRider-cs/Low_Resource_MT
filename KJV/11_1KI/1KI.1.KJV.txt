11:1:001:0	Now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he gat no heat .
11:1:002:0	Wherefore his servants said unto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
11:1:003:0	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
11:1:004:0	And the damsel was very fair , and cherished the king , and ministered to him : but the king knew her not .
11:1:005:0	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
11:1:006:0	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
11:1:007:0	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest : and they following Adonijah helped him .
11:1:008:0	But Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
11:1:009:0	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by En–rogel , and called all his brethren the king's sons , and all the men of Judah the king's servants :
11:1:010:0	But Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he called not .
11:1:011:0	Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath–sheba the mother of Solomon , saying , Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign , and David our lord knoweth it not ?
11:1:012:0	Now therefore come , let me , I pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of thy son Solomon .
11:1:013:0	Go and get thee in unto king David , and say unto him , Didst not thou , my lord , O king , swear unto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ? why then doth Adonijah reign ?
11:1:014:0	Behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , I also will come in after thee , and confirm thy words .
11:1:015:0	And Bath–sheba went in unto the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king .
11:1:016:0	And Bath–sheba bowed , and did obeisance unto the king . And the king said , What wouldest thou ?
11:1:017:0	And she said unto him , My lord , thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne .
11:1:018:0	And now , behold , Adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not :
11:1:019:0	And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
11:1:020:0	And thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
11:1:021:0	Otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders .
11:1:022:0	And , lo , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet also came in .
11:1:023:0	And they told the king , saying , Behold Nathan the prophet . And when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
11:1:024:0	And Nathan said , My lord , O king , hast thou said , Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ?
11:1:025:0	For he is gone down this day , and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the king's sons , and the captains of the host , and Abiathar the priest ; and , behold , they eat and drink before him , and say , God save king Adonijah .
11:1:026:0	But me , even me thy servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and thy servant Solomon , hath he not called .
11:1:027:0	Is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
11:1:028:0	Then king David answered and said , Call me Bath–sheba . And she came into the king's presence , and stood before the king .
11:1:029:0	And the king sware , and said , As the Lord liveth , that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
11:1:030:0	Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
11:1:031:0	Then Bath–sheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , Let my lord king David live for ever .
11:1:032:0	And king David said , Call me Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada . And they came before the king .
11:1:033:0	The king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon :
11:1:034:0	And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel : and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , God save king Solomon .
11:1:035:0	Then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
11:1:036:0	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king , and said , Amen : the Lord God of my lord the king say so too .
11:1:037:0	As the Lord hath been with my lord the king , even so be he with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David .
11:1:038:0	So Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
11:1:039:0	And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon . And they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
11:1:040:0	And all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
11:1:041:0	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating . And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet , he said , Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar ?
11:1:042:0	And while he yet spake , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
11:1:043:0	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah , Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king .
11:1:044:0	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule :
11:1:045:0	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon : and they are come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again . This is the noise that ye have heard .
11:1:046:0	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom .
11:1:047:0	And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . And the king bowed himself upon the bed .
11:1:048:0	And also thus said the king , Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
11:1:049:0	And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid , and rose up , and went every man his way .
11:1:050:0	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon , and arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
11:1:051:0	And it was told Solomon , saying , Behold , Adonijah feareth king Solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword .
11:1:052:0	And Solomon said , If he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die .
11:1:053:0	So king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to thine house .
