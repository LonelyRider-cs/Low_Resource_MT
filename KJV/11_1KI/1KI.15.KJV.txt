11:15:001:0	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah .
11:15:002:0	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem . And his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
11:15:003:0	And he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the his God , as the heart of David his father .
11:15:004:0	Nevertheless for David 's sake did the his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem :
11:15:005:0	Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
11:15:006:0	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life .
11:15:007:0	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
11:15:008:0	And Abijam slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in the city of David : and Asa his son reigned in his stead .
11:15:009:0	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah .
11:15:010:0	And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem . And his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
11:15:011:0	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the , as did David his father .
11:15:012:0	And he took away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
11:15:013:0	And also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook Kidron .
11:15:014:0	But the high places were not removed : nevertheless Asa 's heart was perfect with the all his days .
11:15:015:0	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the , silver , and gold , and vessels .
11:15:016:0	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
11:15:017:0	And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
11:15:018:0	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the , and the treasures of the king 's house , and delivered them into the hand of his servants : and king Asa sent them to Ben–hadad , the son of Tabrimon , the son of Hezion , king of Syria , that dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
11:15:019:0	There is a league between me and thee , and between my father and thy father : behold , I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold ; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me .
11:15:020:0	So Ben–hadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel–beth–maachah , and all Chinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
11:15:021:0	And it came to pass , when Baasha heard thereof , that he left off building of Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah .
11:15:022:0	Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had builded ; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
11:15:023:0	The rest of all the acts of Asa , and all his might , and all that he did , and the cities which he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet .
11:15:024:0	And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead .
11:15:025:0	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned over Israel two years .
11:15:026:0	And he did evil in the sight of the , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
11:15:027:0	And Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
11:15:028:0	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead .
11:15:029:0	And it came to pass , when he reigned , that he smote all the house of Jeroboam ; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed , until he had destroyed him , according unto the saying of the , which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite :
11:15:030:0	Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the God of Israel to anger .
11:15:031:0	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
11:15:032:0	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
11:15:033:0	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah , twenty and four years .
11:15:034:0	And he did evil in the sight of the , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
