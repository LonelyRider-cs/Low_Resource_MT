11:4:001:0	So king Solomon was king over all Israel .
11:4:002:0	And these were the princes which he had ; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest ,
11:4:003:0	Elihoreph and Ahiah , the sons of Shisha , scribes ; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , the recorder .
11:4:004:0	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host : and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests :
11:4:005:0	And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers : and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer , and the king's friend :
11:4:006:0	And Ahishar was over the household : and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute .
11:4:007:0	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel , which provided victuals for the king and his household : each man his month in a year made provision .
11:4:008:0	And these are their names : The son of Hur , in mount Ephraim :
11:4:009:0	The son of Dekar , in Makaz , and in Shaalbim , and Beth–shemesh , and Elon–beth–hanan :
11:4:010:0	The son of Hesed , in Aruboth ; to him pertained Soco , and all the land of Hepher :
11:4:011:0	The son of Abinadab , in all the region of Dor ; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife :
11:4:012:0	Baana the son of Ahilud ; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth–shean , which is by Zarethan beneath Jezreel , from Beth–shean to Abel–meholah , even unto the place that is beyond Jokmeam :
11:4:013:0	The son of Geber , in Ramoth–gilead ; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him also pertained the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars :
11:4:014:0	Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim :
11:4:015:0	Ahimaaz was in Naphtali ; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife :
11:4:016:0	Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth :
11:4:017:0	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah , in Issachar :
11:4:018:0	Shimei the son of Elah , in Benjamin :
11:4:019:0	Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
11:4:020:0	Judah and Israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking , and making merry .
11:4:021:0	And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines , and unto the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
11:4:022:0	And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour , and threescore measures of meal ,
11:4:023:0	Ten fat oxen , and twenty oxen out of the pastures , and an hundred sheep , beside harts , and roebucks , and fallowdeer , and fatted fowl .
11:4:024:0	For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
11:4:025:0	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beer–sheba , all the days of Solomon .
11:4:026:0	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen .
11:4:027:0	And those officers provided victual for king Solomon , and for all that came unto king Solomon's table , every man in his month : they lacked nothing .
11:4:028:0	Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were , every man according to his charge .
11:4:029:0	And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
11:4:030:0	And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
11:4:031:0	For he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Chalcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all nations round about .
11:4:032:0	And he spake three thousand proverbs : and his songs were a thousand and five .
11:4:033:0	And he spake of trees , from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he spake also of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
11:4:034:0	And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , which had heard of his wisdom .
