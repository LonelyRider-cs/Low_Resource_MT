11:14:001:0	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick .
11:14:002:0	And Jeroboam said to his wife , Arise , I pray thee , and disguise thyself , that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam ; and get thee to Shiloh : behold , there is Ahijah the prophet , which told me that I should be king over this people .
11:14:003:0	And take with thee ten loaves , and cracknels , and a cruse of honey , and go to him : he shall tell thee what shall become of the child .
11:14:004:0	And Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . But Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
11:14:005:0	And the said unto Ahijah , Behold , the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son ; for he is sick : thus and thus shalt thou say unto her : for it shall be , when she cometh in , that she shall feign herself to be another woman .
11:14:006:0	And it was so , when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet , as she came in at the door , that he said , Come in , thou wife of Jeroboam ; why feignest thou thyself to be another ? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings .
11:14:007:0	Go , tell Jeroboam , Thus saith the God of Israel , Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel ,
11:14:008:0	And rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
11:14:009:0	But hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
11:14:010:0	Therefore , behold , I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam , and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel , and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam , as a man taketh away dung , till it be all gone .
11:14:011:0	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the hath spoken it .
11:14:012:0	Arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
11:14:013:0	And all Israel shall mourn for him , and bury him : for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam .
11:14:014:0	Moreover the shall raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day : but what ? even now .
11:14:015:0	For the shall smite Israel , as a reed is shaken in the water , and he shall root up Israel out of this good land , which he gave to their fathers , and shall scatter them beyond the river , because they have made their groves , provoking the to anger .
11:14:016:0	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
11:14:017:0	And Jeroboam 's wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah : and when she came to the threshold of the door , the child died ;
11:14:018:0	And they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the , which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet .
11:14:019:0	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
11:14:020:0	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years : and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his stead .
11:14:021:0	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah . Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the did choose out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his name there . And his mother 's name was Naamah an Ammonitess .
11:14:022:0	And Judah did evil in the sight of the , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
11:14:023:0	For they also built them high places , and images , and groves , on every high hill , and under every green tree .
11:14:024:0	And there were also sodomites in the land : and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the cast out before the children of Israel .
11:14:025:0	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem :
11:14:026:0	And he took away the treasures of the house of the , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
11:14:027:0	And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
11:14:028:0	And it was so , when the king went into the house of the , that the guard bare them , and brought them back into the guard chamber .
11:14:029:0	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
11:14:030:0	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days .
11:14:031:0	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . And his mother 's name was Naamah an Ammonitess . And Abijam his son reigned in his stead .
