52:2:001:0	For yourselves , brethren , know our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain :
52:2:002:0	But even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
52:2:003:0	For our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
52:2:004:0	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
52:2:005:0	For neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloak of covetousness ; God is witness :
52:2:006:0	Nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the apostles of Christ .
52:2:007:0	But we were gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children :
52:2:008:0	So being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
52:2:009:0	For ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
52:2:010:0	Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe :
52:2:011:0	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
52:2:012:0	That ye would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
52:2:013:0	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing , because , when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us , ye received it not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of God , which effectually worketh also in you that believe .
52:2:014:0	For ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews :
52:2:015:0	Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
52:2:016:0	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
52:2:017:0	But we , brethren , being taken from you for a short time in presence , not in heart , endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
52:2:018:0	Wherefore we would have come unto you , even I Paul , once and again ; but Satan hindered us .
52:2:019:0	For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?
52:2:020:0	For ye are our glory and joy .
