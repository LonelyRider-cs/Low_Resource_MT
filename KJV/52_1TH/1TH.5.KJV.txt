52:5:001:0	But of the times and the seasons , brethren , ye have no need that I write unto you .
52:5:002:0	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
52:5:003:0	For when they shall say , Peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape .
52:5:004:0	But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief .
52:5:005:0	Ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
52:5:006:0	Therefore let us not sleep , as do others ; but let us watch and be sober .
52:5:007:0	For they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night .
52:5:008:0	But let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
52:5:009:0	For God hath not appointed us to wrath , but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52:5:010:0	Who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
52:5:011:0	Wherefore comfort yourselves together , and edify one another , even as also ye do .
52:5:012:0	And we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
52:5:013:0	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . And be at peace among yourselves .
52:5:014:0	Now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
52:5:015:0	See that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
52:5:016:0	Rejoice evermore .
52:5:017:0	Pray without ceasing .
52:5:018:0	In every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
52:5:019:0	Quench not the Spirit .
52:5:020:0	Despise not prophesyings .
52:5:021:0	Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good .
52:5:022:0	Abstain from all appearance of evil .
52:5:023:0	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52:5:024:0	Faithful is he that calleth you , who also will do it .
52:5:025:0	Brethren , pray for us .
52:5:026:0	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss .
52:5:027:0	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren .
52:5:028:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
