46:14:001:0	Follow after charity , and desire spiritual gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy .
46:14:002:0	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
46:14:003:0	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
46:14:004:0	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
46:14:005:0	I would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
46:14:006:0	Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
46:14:007:0	And even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
46:14:008:0	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
46:14:009:0	So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
46:14:010:0	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
46:14:011:0	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
46:14:012:0	Even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
46:14:013:0	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .
46:14:014:0	For if I pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is unfruitful .
46:14:015:0	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
46:14:016:0	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
46:14:017:0	For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
46:14:018:0	I thank my God , I speak with tongues more than ye all :
46:14:019:0	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
46:14:020:0	Brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
46:14:021:0	In the law it is written , With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people ; and yet for all that will they not hear me , saith the Lord .
46:14:022:0	Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
46:14:023:0	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
46:14:024:0	But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
46:14:025:0	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
46:14:026:0	How is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , every one of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . Let all things be done unto edifying .
46:14:027:0	If any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
46:14:028:0	But if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
46:14:029:0	Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
46:14:030:0	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
46:14:031:0	For ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
46:14:032:0	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
46:14:033:0	For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
46:14:034:0	Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
46:14:035:0	And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
46:14:036:0	What ? came the word of God out from you ? or came it unto you only ?
46:14:037:0	If any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
46:14:038:0	But if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
46:14:039:0	Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
46:14:040:0	Let all things be done decently and in order .
