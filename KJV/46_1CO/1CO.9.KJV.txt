46:9:001:0	Am I not an apostle ? am I not free ? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord ? are not ye my work in the Lord ?
46:9:002:0	If I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
46:9:003:0	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this ,
46:9:004:0	Have we not power to eat and to drink ?
46:9:005:0	Have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
46:9:006:0	Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power to forbear working ?
46:9:007:0	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
46:9:008:0	Say I these things as a man ? or saith not the law the same also ?
46:9:009:0	For it is written in the law of Moses , Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn . Doth God take care for oxen ?
46:9:010:0	Or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
46:9:011:0	If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
46:9:012:0	If others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? Nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
46:9:013:0	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar ?
46:9:014:0	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel .
46:9:015:0	But I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
46:9:016:0	For though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
46:9:017:0	For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
46:9:018:0	What is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
46:9:019:0	For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
46:9:020:0	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
46:9:021:0	To them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
46:9:022:0	To the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
46:9:023:0	And this I do for the gospel's sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
46:9:024:0	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain .
46:9:025:0	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
46:9:026:0	I therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight I , not as one that beateth the air :
46:9:027:0	But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
