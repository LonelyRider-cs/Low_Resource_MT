46:11:001:0	Be ye followers of me , even as I also am of Christ .
46:11:002:0	Now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
46:11:003:0	But I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
46:11:004:0	Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonoureth his head .
46:11:005:0	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven .
46:11:006:0	For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
46:11:007:0	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
46:11:008:0	For the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
46:11:009:0	Neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
46:11:010:0	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
46:11:011:0	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
46:11:012:0	For as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of God .
46:11:013:0	Judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
46:11:014:0	Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
46:11:015:0	But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
46:11:016:0	But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
46:11:017:0	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
46:11:018:0	For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
46:11:019:0	For there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
46:11:020:0	When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's supper .
46:11:021:0	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
46:11:022:0	What ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not .
46:11:023:0	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread :
46:11:024:0	And when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
46:11:025:0	After the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
46:11:026:0	For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord 's death till he come .
46:11:027:0	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
46:11:028:0	But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
46:11:029:0	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord 's body .
46:11:030:0	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
46:11:031:0	For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
46:11:032:0	But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
46:11:033:0	Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
46:11:034:0	And if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . And the rest will I set in order when I come .
