46:16:001:0	Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I have given order to the churches of Galatia , even so do ye .
46:16:002:0	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
46:16:003:0	And when I come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem .
46:16:004:0	And if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
46:16:005:0	Now I will come unto you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
46:16:006:0	And it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go .
46:16:007:0	For I will not see you now by the way ; but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
46:16:008:0	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
46:16:009:0	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
46:16:010:0	Now if Timothy come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
46:16:011:0	Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
46:16:012:0	As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
46:16:013:0	Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
46:16:014:0	Let all your things be done with charity .
46:16:015:0	I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
46:16:016:0	That ye submit yourselves unto such , and to every one that helpeth with us , and laboureth .
46:16:017:0	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
46:16:018:0	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours : therefore acknowledge ye them that are such .
46:16:019:0	The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
46:16:020:0	All the brethren greet you . Greet ye one another with an holy kiss .
46:16:021:0	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand .
46:16:022:0	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be Anathema Maranatha .
46:16:023:0	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
46:16:024:0	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
