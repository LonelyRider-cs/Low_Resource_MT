46:6:001:0	Dare any of you , having a matter against another , go to law before the unjust , and not before the saints ?
46:6:002:0	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
46:6:003:0	Know ye not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things that pertain to this life ?
46:6:004:0	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
46:6:005:0	I speak to your shame . Is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
46:6:006:0	But brother goeth to law with brother , and that before the unbelievers .
46:6:007:0	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . Why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
46:6:008:0	Nay , ye do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
46:6:009:0	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? Be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
46:6:010:0	Nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of God .
46:6:011:0	And such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
46:6:012:0	All things are lawful unto me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but I will not be brought under the power of any .
46:6:013:0	Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but God shall destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
46:6:014:0	And God hath both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
46:6:015:0	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
46:6:016:0	What ? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ? for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
46:6:017:0	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit .
46:6:018:0	Flee fornication . Every sin that a man doeth is without the body ; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body .
46:6:019:0	What ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
46:6:020:0	For ye are bought with a price : therefore glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's .
