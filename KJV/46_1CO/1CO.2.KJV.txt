46:2:001:0	And I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
46:2:002:0	For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
46:2:003:0	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
46:2:004:0	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
46:2:005:0	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
46:2:006:0	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
46:2:007:0	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
46:2:008:0	Which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46:2:009:0	But as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
46:2:010:0	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
46:2:011:0	For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
46:2:012:0	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
46:2:013:0	Which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
46:2:014:0	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
46:2:015:0	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things , yet he himself is judged of no man .
46:2:016:0	For who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he may instruct him ? But we have the mind of Christ .
