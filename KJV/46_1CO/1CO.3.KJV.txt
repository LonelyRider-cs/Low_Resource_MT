46:3:001:0	And I , brethren , could not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in Christ .
46:3:002:0	I have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
46:3:003:0	For ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ?
46:3:004:0	For while one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ?
46:3:005:0	Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
46:3:006:0	I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
46:3:007:0	So then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
46:3:008:0	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
46:3:009:0	For we are labourers together with God : ye are God 's husbandry , ye are God 's building .
46:3:010:0	According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
46:3:011:0	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46:3:012:0	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
46:3:013:0	Every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
46:3:014:0	If any man 's work abide which he hath built thereupon , he shall receive a reward .
46:3:015:0	If any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
46:3:016:0	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
46:3:017:0	If any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
46:3:018:0	Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
46:3:019:0	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , He taketh the wise in their own craftiness .
46:3:020:0	And again , The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain .
46:3:021:0	Therefore let no man glory in men . For all things are yours ;
46:3:022:0	Whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ;
46:3:023:0	And ye are Christ 's ; and Christ is God 's .
