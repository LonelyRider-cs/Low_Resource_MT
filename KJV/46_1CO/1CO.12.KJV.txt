46:12:001:0	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , I would not have you ignorant .
46:12:002:0	Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
46:12:003:0	Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
46:12:004:0	Now there are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit .
46:12:005:0	And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
46:12:006:0	And there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all .
46:12:007:0	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal .
46:12:008:0	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ;
46:12:009:0	To another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit ;
46:12:010:0	To another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues :
46:12:011:0	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit , dividing to every man severally as he will .
46:12:012:0	For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Christ .
46:12:013:0	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit .
46:12:014:0	For the body is not one member , but many .
46:12:015:0	If the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
46:12:016:0	And if the ear shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
46:12:017:0	If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
46:12:018:0	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
46:12:019:0	And if they were all one member , where were the body ?
46:12:020:0	But now are they many members , yet but one body .
46:12:021:0	And the eye can not say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
46:12:022:0	Nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
46:12:023:0	And those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
46:12:024:0	For our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked :
46:12:025:0	That there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
46:12:026:0	And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
46:12:027:0	Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
46:12:028:0	And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
46:12:029:0	Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles ?
46:12:030:0	Have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
46:12:031:0	But covet earnestly the best gifts : and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way .
