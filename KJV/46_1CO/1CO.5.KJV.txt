46:5:001:0	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father 's wife .
46:5:002:0	And ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
46:5:003:0	For I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
46:5:004:0	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
46:5:005:0	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46:5:006:0	Your glorying is not good . Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
46:5:007:0	Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us :
46:5:008:0	Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46:5:009:0	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators :
46:5:010:0	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
46:5:011:0	But now I have written unto you not to keep company , if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such an one no not to eat .
46:5:012:0	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without ? do not ye judge them that are within ?
46:5:013:0	But them that are without God judgeth . Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
