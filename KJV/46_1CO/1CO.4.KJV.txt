46:4:001:0	Let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of Christ , and stewards of the mysteries of God .
46:4:002:0	Moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
46:4:003:0	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
46:4:004:0	For I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
46:4:005:0	Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
46:4:006:0	And these things , brethren , I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes ; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written , that no one of you be puffed up for one against another .
46:4:007:0	For who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
46:4:008:0	Now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
46:4:009:0	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
46:4:010:0	We are fools for Christ 's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
46:4:011:0	Even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ;
46:4:012:0	And labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it :
46:4:013:0	Being defamed , we entreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
46:4:014:0	I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons I warn you .
46:4:015:0	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
46:4:016:0	Wherefore I beseech you , be ye followers of me .
46:4:017:0	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ , as I teach every where in every church .
46:4:018:0	Now some are puffed up , as though I would not come to you .
46:4:019:0	But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are puffed up , but the power .
46:4:020:0	For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
46:4:021:0	What will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
