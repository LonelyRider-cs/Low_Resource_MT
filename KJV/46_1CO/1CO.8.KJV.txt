46:8:001:0	Now as touching things offered unto idols , we know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffeth up , but charity edifieth .
46:8:002:0	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
46:8:003:0	But if any man love God , the same is known of him .
46:8:004:0	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
46:8:005:0	For though there be that are called gods , whether in heaven or in earth , ( as there be gods many , and lords many , )
46:8:006:0	But to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
46:8:007:0	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
46:8:008:0	But meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
46:8:009:0	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
46:8:010:0	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple , shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols ;
46:8:011:0	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom Christ died ?
46:8:012:0	But when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
46:8:013:0	Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
