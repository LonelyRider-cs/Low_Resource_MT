42:2:001:0	And it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus , that all the world should be taxed .
42:2:002:0	( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
42:2:003:0	And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
42:2:004:0	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
42:2:005:0	To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
42:2:006:0	And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
42:2:007:0	And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
42:2:008:0	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
42:2:009:0	And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
42:2:010:0	And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
42:2:011:0	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
42:2:012:0	And this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .
42:2:013:0	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
42:2:014:0	Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men .
42:2:015:0	And it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
42:2:016:0	And they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
42:2:017:0	And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
42:2:018:0	And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
42:2:019:0	But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
42:2:020:0	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
42:2:021:0	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42:2:022:0	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
42:2:023:0	( As it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
42:2:024:0	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
42:2:025:0	And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
42:2:026:0	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
42:2:027:0	And he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
42:2:028:0	Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
42:2:029:0	Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
42:2:030:0	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
42:2:031:0	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
42:2:032:0	A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
42:2:033:0	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
42:2:034:0	And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
42:2:035:0	( Yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed .
42:2:036:0	And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
42:2:037:0	And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
42:2:038:0	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
42:2:039:0	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
42:2:040:0	And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
42:2:041:0	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
42:2:042:0	And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
42:2:043:0	And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
42:2:044:0	But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
42:2:045:0	And when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him .
42:2:046:0	And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
42:2:047:0	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
42:2:048:0	And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing .
42:2:049:0	And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that I must be about my Father 's business ?
42:2:050:0	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
42:2:051:0	And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
42:2:052:0	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and man .
