42:14:001:0	And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
42:14:002:0	And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
42:14:003:0	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
42:14:004:0	And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
42:14:005:0	And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
42:14:006:0	And they could not answer him again to these things .
42:14:007:0	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them ,
42:14:008:0	When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
42:14:009:0	And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
42:14:010:0	But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
42:14:011:0	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
42:14:012:0	Then said he also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
42:14:013:0	But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
42:14:014:0	And thou shalt be blessed ; for they can not recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
42:14:015:0	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
42:14:016:0	Then said he unto him , A certain man made a great supper , and bade many :
42:14:017:0	And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready .
42:14:018:0	And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
42:14:019:0	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
42:14:020:0	And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come .
42:14:021:0	So that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
42:14:022:0	And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
42:14:023:0	And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
42:14:024:0	For I say unto you , That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
42:14:025:0	And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
42:14:026:0	If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple .
42:14:027:0	And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple .
42:14:028:0	For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
42:14:029:0	Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
42:14:030:0	Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
42:14:031:0	Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
42:14:032:0	Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
42:14:033:0	So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple .
42:14:034:0	Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
42:14:035:0	It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
