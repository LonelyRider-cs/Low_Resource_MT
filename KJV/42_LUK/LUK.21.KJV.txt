42:21:001:0	And he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
42:21:002:0	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
42:21:003:0	And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
42:21:004:0	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
42:21:005:0	And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said ,
42:21:006:0	As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
42:21:007:0	And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
42:21:008:0	And he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
42:21:009:0	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
42:21:010:0	Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom :
42:21:011:0	And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
42:21:012:0	But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
42:21:013:0	And it shall turn to you for a testimony .
42:21:014:0	Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
42:21:015:0	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
42:21:016:0	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
42:21:017:0	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake .
42:21:018:0	But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
42:21:019:0	In your patience possess ye your souls .
42:21:020:0	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
42:21:021:0	Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
42:21:022:0	For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
42:21:023:0	But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
42:21:024:0	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
42:21:025:0	And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
42:21:026:0	Men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
42:21:027:0	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
42:21:028:0	And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
42:21:029:0	And he spake to them a parable ; Behold the fig tree , and all the trees ;
42:21:030:0	When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
42:21:031:0	So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand .
42:21:032:0	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
42:21:033:0	Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
42:21:034:0	And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
42:21:035:0	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
42:21:036:0	Watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
42:21:037:0	And in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives .
42:21:038:0	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him .
