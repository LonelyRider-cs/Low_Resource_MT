42:15:001:0	Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him .
42:15:002:0	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
42:15:003:0	And he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
42:15:004:0	What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
42:15:005:0	And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42:15:006:0	And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
42:15:007:0	I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
42:15:008:0	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
42:15:009:0	And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
42:15:010:0	Likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
42:15:011:0	And he said , A certain man had two sons :
42:15:012:0	And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living .
42:15:013:0	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
42:15:014:0	And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
42:15:015:0	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
42:15:016:0	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
42:15:017:0	And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
42:15:018:0	I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
42:15:019:0	And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
42:15:020:0	And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
42:15:021:0	And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
42:15:022:0	But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
42:15:023:0	And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
42:15:024:0	For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry .
42:15:025:0	Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
42:15:026:0	And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
42:15:027:0	And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
42:15:028:0	And he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and entreated him .
42:15:029:0	And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
42:15:030:0	But as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
42:15:031:0	And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
42:15:032:0	It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
