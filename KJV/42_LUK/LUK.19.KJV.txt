42:19:001:0	And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho .
42:19:002:0	And , behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
42:19:003:0	And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
42:19:004:0	And he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
42:19:005:0	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
42:19:006:0	And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
42:19:007:0	And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
42:19:008:0	And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord ; Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
42:19:009:0	And Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
42:19:010:0	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
42:19:011:0	And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
42:19:012:0	He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
42:19:013:0	And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
42:19:014:0	But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us .
42:19:015:0	And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
42:19:016:0	Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
42:19:017:0	And he said unto him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
42:19:018:0	And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
42:19:019:0	And he said likewise to him , Be thou also over five cities .
42:19:020:0	And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
42:19:021:0	For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
42:19:022:0	And he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow :
42:19:023:0	Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
42:19:024:0	And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
42:19:025:0	( And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . )
42:19:026:0	For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
42:19:027:0	But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
42:19:028:0	And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
42:19:029:0	And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
42:19:030:0	Saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
42:19:031:0	And if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
42:19:032:0	And they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
42:19:033:0	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?
42:19:034:0	And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
42:19:035:0	And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
42:19:036:0	And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
42:19:037:0	And when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
42:19:038:0	Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
42:19:039:0	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
42:19:040:0	And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
42:19:041:0	And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
42:19:042:0	Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
42:19:043:0	For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
42:19:044:0	And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
42:19:045:0	And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
42:19:046:0	Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
42:19:047:0	And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
42:19:048:0	And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
