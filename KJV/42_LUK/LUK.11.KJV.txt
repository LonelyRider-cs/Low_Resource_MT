42:11:001:0	And it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples .
42:11:002:0	And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
42:11:003:0	Give us day by day our daily bread .
42:11:004:0	And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
42:11:005:0	And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ;
42:11:006:0	For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
42:11:007:0	And he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee .
42:11:008:0	I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
42:11:009:0	And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
42:11:010:0	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
42:11:011:0	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
42:11:012:0	Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
42:11:013:0	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
42:11:014:0	And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
42:11:015:0	But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils .
42:11:016:0	And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
42:11:017:0	But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
42:11:018:0	If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub .
42:11:019:0	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
42:11:020:0	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
42:11:021:0	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
42:11:022:0	But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
42:11:023:0	He that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
42:11:024:0	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
42:11:025:0	And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
42:11:026:0	Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
42:11:027:0	And it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
42:11:028:0	But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it .
42:11:029:0	And when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
42:11:030:0	For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
42:11:031:0	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
42:11:032:0	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
42:11:033:0	No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
42:11:034:0	The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
42:11:035:0	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
42:11:036:0	If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
42:11:037:0	And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
42:11:038:0	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
42:11:039:0	And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
42:11:040:0	Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
42:11:041:0	But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
42:11:042:0	But woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
42:11:043:0	Woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
42:11:044:0	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
42:11:045:0	Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
42:11:046:0	And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
42:11:047:0	Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
42:11:048:0	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
42:11:049:0	Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
42:11:050:0	That the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
42:11:051:0	From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
42:11:052:0	Woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
42:11:053:0	And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
42:11:054:0	Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
