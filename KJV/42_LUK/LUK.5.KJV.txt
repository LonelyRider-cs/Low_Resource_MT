42:5:001:0	And it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret ,
42:5:002:0	And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
42:5:003:0	And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
42:5:004:0	Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
42:5:005:0	And Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
42:5:006:0	And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
42:5:007:0	And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
42:5:008:0	When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
42:5:009:0	For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
42:5:010:0	And so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
42:5:011:0	And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
42:5:012:0	And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
42:5:013:0	And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
42:5:014:0	And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
42:5:015:0	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
42:5:016:0	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
42:5:017:0	And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
42:5:018:0	And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
42:5:019:0	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
42:5:020:0	And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
42:5:021:0	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
42:5:022:0	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ?
42:5:023:0	Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
42:5:024:0	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .
42:5:025:0	And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
42:5:026:0	And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to day .
42:5:027:0	And after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Follow me .
42:5:028:0	And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
42:5:029:0	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
42:5:030:0	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
42:5:031:0	And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick .
42:5:032:0	I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
42:5:033:0	And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
42:5:034:0	And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
42:5:035:0	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
42:5:036:0	And he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
42:5:037:0	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
42:5:038:0	But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
42:5:039:0	No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , The old is better .
