42:4:001:0	And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
42:4:002:0	Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
42:4:003:0	And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
42:4:004:0	And Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
42:4:005:0	And the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
42:4:006:0	And the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
42:4:007:0	If thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine .
42:4:008:0	And Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
42:4:009:0	And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
42:4:010:0	For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
42:4:011:0	And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
42:4:012:0	And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
42:4:013:0	And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
42:4:014:0	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
42:4:015:0	And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
42:4:016:0	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
42:4:017:0	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
42:4:018:0	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
42:4:019:0	To preach the acceptable year of the Lord .
42:4:020:0	And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
42:4:021:0	And he began to say unto them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
42:4:022:0	And all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Joseph's son ?
42:4:023:0	And he said unto them , Ye will surely say unto me this proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country .
42:4:024:0	And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is accepted in his own country .
42:4:025:0	But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
42:4:026:0	But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
42:4:027:0	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
42:4:028:0	And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
42:4:029:0	And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
42:4:030:0	But he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
42:4:031:0	And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
42:4:032:0	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
42:4:033:0	And in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
42:4:034:0	Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God .
42:4:035:0	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
42:4:036:0	And they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
42:4:037:0	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
42:4:038:0	And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon's house . And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
42:4:039:0	And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
42:4:040:0	Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
42:4:041:0	And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
42:4:042:0	And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
42:4:043:0	And he said unto them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent .
42:4:044:0	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
