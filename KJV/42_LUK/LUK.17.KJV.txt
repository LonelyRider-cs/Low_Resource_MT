42:17:001:0	Then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come !
42:17:002:0	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
42:17:003:0	Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
42:17:004:0	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
42:17:005:0	And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
42:17:006:0	And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
42:17:007:0	But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
42:17:008:0	And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
42:17:009:0	Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not .
42:17:010:0	So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
42:17:011:0	And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
42:17:012:0	And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
42:17:013:0	And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
42:17:014:0	And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
42:17:015:0	And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
42:17:016:0	And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
42:17:017:0	And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
42:17:018:0	There are not found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger .
42:17:019:0	And he said unto him , Arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
42:17:020:0	And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation :
42:17:021:0	Neither shall they say , Lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of God is within you .
42:17:022:0	And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
42:17:023:0	And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
42:17:024:0	For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
42:17:025:0	But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
42:17:026:0	And as it was in the days of Noah , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
42:17:027:0	They did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
42:17:028:0	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
42:17:029:0	But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
42:17:030:0	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed .
42:17:031:0	In that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
42:17:032:0	Remember Lot's wife .
42:17:033:0	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
42:17:034:0	I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
42:17:035:0	Two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
42:17:036:0	Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
42:17:037:0	And they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? And he said unto them , Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together .
