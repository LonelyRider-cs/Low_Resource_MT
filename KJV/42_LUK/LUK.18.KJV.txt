42:18:001:0	And he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
42:18:002:0	Saying , There was in a city a judge , which feared not God , neither regarded man :
42:18:003:0	And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary .
42:18:004:0	And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ;
42:18:005:0	Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
42:18:006:0	And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith .
42:18:007:0	And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
42:18:008:0	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
42:18:009:0	And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
42:18:010:0	Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
42:18:011:0	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
42:18:012:0	I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess .
42:18:013:0	And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner .
42:18:014:0	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
42:18:015:0	And they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
42:18:016:0	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
42:18:017:0	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
42:18:018:0	And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
42:18:019:0	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , God .
42:18:020:0	Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
42:18:021:0	And he said , All these have I kept from my youth up .
42:18:022:0	Now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
42:18:023:0	And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
42:18:024:0	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
42:18:025:0	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
42:18:026:0	And they that heard it said , Who then can be saved ?
42:18:027:0	And he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God .
42:18:028:0	Then Peter said , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee .
42:18:029:0	And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God's sake ,
42:18:030:0	Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
42:18:031:0	Then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
42:18:032:0	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
42:18:033:0	And they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
42:18:034:0	And they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
42:18:035:0	And it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
42:18:036:0	And hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
42:18:037:0	And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by .
42:18:038:0	And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
42:18:039:0	And they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
42:18:040:0	And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
42:18:041:0	Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight .
42:18:042:0	And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
42:18:043:0	And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
