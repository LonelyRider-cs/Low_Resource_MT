42:3:001:0	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene ,
42:3:002:0	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
42:3:003:0	And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
42:3:004:0	As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
42:3:005:0	Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
42:3:006:0	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
42:3:007:0	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42:3:008:0	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
42:3:009:0	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
42:3:010:0	And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ?
42:3:011:0	He answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
42:3:012:0	Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , Master , what shall we do ?
42:3:013:0	And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you .
42:3:014:0	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
42:3:015:0	And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
42:3:016:0	John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
42:3:017:0	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
42:3:018:0	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
42:3:019:0	But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip 's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,
42:3:020:0	Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
42:3:021:0	Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
42:3:022:0	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
