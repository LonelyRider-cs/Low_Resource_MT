42:6:001:0	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
42:6:002:0	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
42:6:003:0	And Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
42:6:004:0	How he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
42:6:005:0	And he said unto them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
42:6:006:0	And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
42:6:007:0	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
42:6:008:0	But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth .
42:6:009:0	Then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
42:6:010:0	And looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
42:6:011:0	And they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
42:6:012:0	And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
42:6:013:0	And when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
42:6:014:0	Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
42:6:015:0	Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes ,
42:6:016:0	And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor .
42:6:017:0	And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
42:6:018:0	And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
42:6:019:0	And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
42:6:020:0	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
42:6:021:0	Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
42:6:022:0	Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man's sake .
42:6:023:0	Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
42:6:024:0	But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
42:6:025:0	Woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
42:6:026:0	Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
42:6:027:0	But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies , do good to them which hate you ,
42:6:028:0	Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
42:6:029:0	And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also .
42:6:030:0	Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
42:6:031:0	And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
42:6:032:0	For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
42:6:033:0	And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
42:6:034:0	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
42:6:035:0	But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
42:6:036:0	Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
42:6:037:0	Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
42:6:038:0	Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
42:6:039:0	And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
42:6:040:0	The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
42:6:041:0	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
42:6:042:0	Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye .
42:6:043:0	For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
42:6:044:0	For every tree is known by his own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
42:6:045:0	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
42:6:046:0	And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
42:6:047:0	Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
42:6:048:0	He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
42:6:049:0	But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
