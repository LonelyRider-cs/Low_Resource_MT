42:20:001:0	And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
42:20:002:0	And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
42:20:003:0	And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
42:20:004:0	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
42:20:005:0	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
42:20:006:0	But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet .
42:20:007:0	And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
42:20:008:0	And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
42:20:009:0	Then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
42:20:010:0	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
42:20:011:0	And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
42:20:012:0	And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
42:20:013:0	Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
42:20:014:0	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
42:20:015:0	So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
42:20:016:0	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
42:20:017:0	And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
42:20:018:0	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
42:20:019:0	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
42:20:020:0	And they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
42:20:021:0	And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly :
42:20:022:0	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or no ?
42:20:023:0	But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
42:20:024:0	Shew me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Caesar's .
42:20:025:0	And he said unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's , and unto God the things which be God's .
42:20:026:0	And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
42:20:027:0	Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
42:20:028:0	Saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man's brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
42:20:029:0	There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
42:20:030:0	And the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
42:20:031:0	And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
42:20:032:0	Last of all the woman died also .
42:20:033:0	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
42:20:034:0	And Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
42:20:035:0	But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
42:20:036:0	Neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
42:20:037:0	Now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
42:20:038:0	For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
42:20:039:0	Then certain of the scribes answering said , Master , thou hast well said .
42:20:040:0	And after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
42:20:041:0	And he said unto them , How say they that Christ is David's son ?
42:20:042:0	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
42:20:043:0	Till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
42:20:044:0	David therefore calleth him Lord , how is he then his son ?
42:20:045:0	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
42:20:046:0	Beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
42:20:047:0	Which devour widows' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation .
