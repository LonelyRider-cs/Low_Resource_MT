42:22:001:0	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover .
42:22:002:0	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
42:22:003:0	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
42:22:004:0	And he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
42:22:005:0	And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
42:22:006:0	And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
42:22:007:0	Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
42:22:008:0	And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat .
42:22:009:0	And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
42:22:010:0	And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
42:22:011:0	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
42:22:012:0	And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
42:22:013:0	And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
42:22:014:0	And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
42:22:015:0	And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer :
42:22:016:0	For I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
42:22:017:0	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
42:22:018:0	For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
42:22:019:0	And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
42:22:020:0	Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
42:22:021:0	But , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
42:22:022:0	And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
42:22:023:0	And they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
42:22:024:0	And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
42:22:025:0	And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
42:22:026:0	But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
42:22:027:0	For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
42:22:028:0	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations .
42:22:029:0	And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ;
42:22:030:0	That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42:22:031:0	And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
42:22:032:0	But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
42:22:033:0	And he said unto him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
42:22:034:0	And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
42:22:035:0	And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing .
42:22:036:0	Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
42:22:037:0	For I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
42:22:038:0	And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough .
42:22:039:0	And he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
42:22:040:0	And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
42:22:041:0	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
42:22:042:0	Saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
42:22:043:0	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him .
42:22:044:0	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
42:22:045:0	And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
42:22:046:0	And said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
42:22:047:0	And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
42:22:048:0	But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
42:22:049:0	When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
42:22:050:0	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
42:22:051:0	And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him .
42:22:052:0	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
42:22:053:0	When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
42:22:054:0	Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest's house . And Peter followed afar off .
42:22:055:0	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
42:22:056:0	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
42:22:057:0	And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not .
42:22:058:0	And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not .
42:22:059:0	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
42:22:060:0	And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
42:22:061:0	And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
42:22:062:0	And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
42:22:063:0	And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
42:22:064:0	And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
42:22:065:0	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
42:22:066:0	And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
42:22:067:0	Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe :
42:22:068:0	And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
42:22:069:0	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
42:22:070:0	Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
42:22:071:0	And they said , What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
