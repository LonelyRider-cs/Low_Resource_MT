42:9:001:0	Then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
42:9:002:0	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
42:9:003:0	And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
42:9:004:0	And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
42:9:005:0	And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
42:9:006:0	And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
42:9:007:0	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
42:9:008:0	And of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
42:9:009:0	And Herod said , John have I beheaded : but who is this , of whom I hear such things ? And he desired to see him .
42:9:010:0	And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
42:9:011:0	And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
42:9:012:0	And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
42:9:013:0	But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
42:9:014:0	For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company .
42:9:015:0	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
42:9:016:0	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
42:9:017:0	And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
42:9:018:0	And it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
42:9:019:0	They answering said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
42:9:020:0	He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
42:9:021:0	And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
42:9:022:0	Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
42:9:023:0	And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
42:9:024:0	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
42:9:025:0	For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
42:9:026:0	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father's , and of the holy angels .
42:9:027:0	But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
42:9:028:0	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
42:9:029:0	And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
42:9:030:0	And , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias :
42:9:031:0	Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem .
42:9:032:0	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
42:9:033:0	And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
42:9:034:0	While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
42:9:035:0	And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
42:9:036:0	And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
42:9:037:0	And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
42:9:038:0	And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
42:9:039:0	And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
42:9:040:0	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
42:9:041:0	And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither .
42:9:042:0	And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
42:9:043:0	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
42:9:044:0	Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
42:9:045:0	But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
42:9:046:0	Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
42:9:047:0	And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
42:9:048:0	And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
42:9:049:0	And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
42:9:050:0	And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
42:9:051:0	And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
42:9:052:0	And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
42:9:053:0	And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
42:9:054:0	And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ?
42:9:055:0	But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
42:9:056:0	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives , but to save them . And they went to another village .
42:9:057:0	And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
42:9:058:0	And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
42:9:059:0	And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
42:9:060:0	Jesus said unto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God .
42:9:061:0	And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
42:9:062:0	And Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
