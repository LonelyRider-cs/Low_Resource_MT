42:24:001:0	Now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
42:24:002:0	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
42:24:003:0	And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
42:24:004:0	And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
42:24:005:0	And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
42:24:006:0	He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
42:24:007:0	Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
42:24:008:0	And they remembered his words ,
42:24:009:0	And returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
42:24:010:0	It was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
42:24:011:0	And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
42:24:012:0	Then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
42:24:013:0	And , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
42:24:014:0	And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
42:24:015:0	And it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
42:24:016:0	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
42:24:017:0	And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
42:24:018:0	And the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
42:24:019:0	And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people :
42:24:020:0	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
42:24:021:0	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
42:24:022:0	Yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
42:24:023:0	And when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , which said that he was alive .
42:24:024:0	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
42:24:025:0	Then he said unto them , O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
42:24:026:0	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ?
42:24:027:0	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
42:24:028:0	And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
42:24:029:0	But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . And he went in to tarry with them .
42:24:030:0	And it came to pass , as he sat at the table with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
42:24:031:0	And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
42:24:032:0	And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
42:24:033:0	And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
42:24:034:0	Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
42:24:035:0	And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
42:24:036:0	And as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
42:24:037:0	But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
42:24:038:0	And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
42:24:039:0	Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
42:24:040:0	And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
42:24:041:0	And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ?
42:24:042:0	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
42:24:043:0	And he took it , and did eat before them .
42:24:044:0	And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
42:24:045:0	Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
42:24:046:0	And said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
42:24:047:0	And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
42:24:048:0	And ye are witnesses of these things .
42:24:049:0	And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
42:24:050:0	And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
42:24:051:0	And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
42:24:052:0	And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy :
42:24:053:0	And were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
