42:10:001:0	After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
42:10:002:0	Therefore said he unto them , The harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
42:10:003:0	Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves .
42:10:004:0	Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
42:10:005:0	And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house .
42:10:006:0	And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
42:10:007:0	And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
42:10:008:0	And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
42:10:009:0	And heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
42:10:010:0	But into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
42:10:011:0	Even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
42:10:012:0	But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
42:10:013:0	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42:10:014:0	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
42:10:015:0	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
42:10:016:0	He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
42:10:017:0	And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name .
42:10:018:0	And he said unto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven .
42:10:019:0	Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
42:10:020:0	Notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
42:10:021:0	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
42:10:022:0	All things are delivered to me of my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him .
42:10:023:0	And he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
42:10:024:0	For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
42:10:025:0	And , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
42:10:026:0	He said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
42:10:027:0	And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
42:10:028:0	And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
42:10:029:0	But he , willing to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbour ?
42:10:030:0	And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
42:10:031:0	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
42:10:032:0	And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
42:10:033:0	But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
42:10:034:0	And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
42:10:035:0	And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
42:10:036:0	Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
42:10:037:0	And he said , He that shewed mercy on him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
42:10:038:0	Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
42:10:039:0	And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus' feet , and heard his word .
42:10:040:0	But Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
42:10:041:0	And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
42:10:042:0	But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
