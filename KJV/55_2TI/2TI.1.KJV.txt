55:1:001:0	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus ,
55:1:002:0	To Timothy , my dearly beloved son : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55:1:003:0	I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
55:1:004:0	Greatly desiring to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
55:1:005:0	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
55:1:006:0	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
55:1:007:0	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind .
55:1:008:0	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner : but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God ;
55:1:009:0	Who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
55:1:010:0	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ , who hath abolished death , and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel :
55:1:011:0	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
55:1:012:0	For the which cause I also suffer these things : nevertheless I am not ashamed : for I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day .
55:1:013:0	Hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
55:1:014:0	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us .
55:1:015:0	This thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
55:1:016:0	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus ; for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain :
55:1:017:0	But , when he was in Rome , he sought me out very diligently , and found me .
55:1:018:0	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
