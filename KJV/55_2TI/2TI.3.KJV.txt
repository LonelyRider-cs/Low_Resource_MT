55:3:001:0	This know also , that in the last days perilous times shall come .
55:3:002:0	For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
55:3:003:0	Without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good ,
55:3:004:0	Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
55:3:005:0	Having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
55:3:006:0	For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
55:3:007:0	Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
55:3:008:0	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
55:3:009:0	But they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as theirs also was .
55:3:010:0	But thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , charity , patience ,
55:3:011:0	Persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
55:3:012:0	Yea , and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution .
55:3:013:0	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse , deceiving , and being deceived .
55:3:014:0	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing of whom thou hast learned them ;
55:3:015:0	And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
55:3:016:0	All scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
55:3:017:0	That the man of God may be perfect , thoroughly furnished unto all good works .
