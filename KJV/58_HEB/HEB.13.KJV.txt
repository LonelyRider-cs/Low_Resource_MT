58:13:001:0	Let brotherly love continue .
58:13:002:0	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers : for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
58:13:003:0	Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
58:13:004:0	Marriage is honourable in all , and the bed undefiled : but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge .
58:13:005:0	Let your conversation be without covetousness ; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee .
58:13:006:0	So that we may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me .
58:13:007:0	Remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
58:13:008:0	Jesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever .
58:13:009:0	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
58:13:010:0	We have an altar , whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle .
58:13:011:0	For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
58:13:012:0	Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
58:13:013:0	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp , bearing his reproach .
58:13:014:0	For here have we no continuing city , but we seek one to come .
58:13:015:0	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
58:13:016:0	But to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
58:13:017:0	Obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
58:13:018:0	Pray for us : for we trust we have a good conscience , in all things willing to live honestly .
58:13:019:0	But I beseech you the rather to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
58:13:020:0	Now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
58:13:021:0	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
58:13:022:0	And I beseech you , brethren , suffer the word of exhortation : for I have written a letter unto you in few words .
58:13:023:0	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
58:13:024:0	Salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . They of Italy salute you .
58:13:025:0	Grace be with you all . Amen .
