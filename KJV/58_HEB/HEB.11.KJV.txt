58:11:001:0	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen .
58:11:002:0	For by it the elders obtained a good report .
58:11:003:0	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
58:11:004:0	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
58:11:005:0	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
58:11:006:0	But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
58:11:007:0	By faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
58:11:008:0	By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
58:11:009:0	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
58:11:010:0	For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
58:11:011:0	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
58:11:012:0	Therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
58:11:013:0	These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
58:11:014:0	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
58:11:015:0	And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
58:11:016:0	But now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
58:11:017:0	By faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered up Isaac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
58:11:018:0	Of whom it was said , That in Isaac shall thy seed be called :
58:11:019:0	Accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
58:11:020:0	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
58:11:021:0	By faith Jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
58:11:022:0	By faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
58:11:023:0	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
58:11:024:0	By faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ;
58:11:025:0	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
58:11:026:0	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
58:11:027:0	By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
58:11:028:0	Through faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
58:11:029:0	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
58:11:030:0	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .
58:11:031:0	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
58:11:032:0	And what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
58:11:033:0	Who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
58:11:034:0	Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
58:11:035:0	Women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
58:11:036:0	And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
58:11:037:0	They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
58:11:038:0	( Of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
58:11:039:0	And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise :
58:11:040:0	God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect .
