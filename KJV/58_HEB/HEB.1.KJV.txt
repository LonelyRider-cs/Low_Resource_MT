58:1:001:0	God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
58:1:002:0	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
58:1:003:0	Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high ;
58:1:004:0	Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
58:1:005:0	For unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
58:1:006:0	And again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
58:1:007:0	And of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
58:1:008:0	But unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
58:1:009:0	Thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
58:1:010:0	And , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
58:1:011:0	They shall perish ; but thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment ;
58:1:012:0	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
58:1:013:0	But to which of the angels said he at any time , Sit on my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
58:1:014:0	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?
