58:10:001:0	For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
58:10:002:0	For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
58:10:003:0	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
58:10:004:0	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
58:10:005:0	Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me :
58:10:006:0	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
58:10:007:0	Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
58:10:008:0	Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ;
58:10:009:0	Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
58:10:010:0	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58:10:011:0	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins :
58:10:012:0	But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
58:10:013:0	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
58:10:014:0	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
58:10:015:0	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
58:10:016:0	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
58:10:017:0	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more .
58:10:018:0	Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
58:10:019:0	Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
58:10:020:0	By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
58:10:021:0	And having an high priest over the house of God ;
58:10:022:0	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
58:10:023:0	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
58:10:024:0	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works :
58:10:025:0	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
58:10:026:0	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
58:10:027:0	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
58:10:028:0	He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
58:10:029:0	Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
58:10:030:0	For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people .
58:10:031:0	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58:10:032:0	But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
58:10:033:0	Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
58:10:034:0	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
58:10:035:0	Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
58:10:036:0	For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
58:10:037:0	For yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry .
58:10:038:0	Now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
58:10:039:0	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
