24:1:001:0	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
24:1:002:0	To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
24:1:003:0	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
24:1:004:0	Then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
24:1:005:0	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee ; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee , and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations .
24:1:006:0	Then said I , Ah , Lord God ! behold , I cannot speak : for I am a child .
24:1:007:0	But the Lord said unto me , Say not , I am a child : for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
24:1:008:0	Be not afraid of their faces : for I am with thee to deliver thee , saith the Lord .
24:1:009:0	Then the Lord put forth his hand , and touched my mouth . And the Lord said unto me , Behold , I have put my words in thy mouth .
24:1:010:0	See , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
24:1:011:0	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying , Jeremiah , what seest thou ? And I said , I see a rod of an almond tree .
24:1:012:0	Then said the Lord unto me , Thou hast well seen : for I will hasten my word to perform it .
24:1:013:0	And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time , saying , What seest thou ? And I said , I see a seething pot ; and the face thereof is toward the north .
24:1:014:0	Then the Lord said unto me , Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
24:1:015:0	For , lo , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , saith the Lord ; and they shall come , and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof round about , and against all the cities of Judah .
24:1:016:0	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
24:1:017:0	Thou therefore gird up thy loins , and arise , and speak unto them all that I command thee : be not dismayed at their faces , lest I confound thee before them .
24:1:018:0	For , behold , I have made thee this day a defenced city , and an iron pillar , and brasen walls against the whole land , against the kings of Judah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
24:1:019:0	And they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , saith the Lord , to deliver thee .
