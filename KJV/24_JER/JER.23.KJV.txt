24:23:001:0	Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ! saith the .
24:23:002:0	Therefore thus saith the God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people ; Ye have scattered my flock , and driven them away , and have not visited them : behold , I will visit upon you the evil of your doings , saith the .
24:23:003:0	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
24:23:004:0	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the .
24:23:005:0	Behold , the days come , saith the , that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch , and a King shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
24:23:006:0	In his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely : and this is his name whereby he shall be called , THE OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS .
24:23:007:0	Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the , that they shall no more say , The liveth , which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
24:23:008:0	But , The liveth , which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I had driven them ; and they shall dwell in their own land .
24:23:009:0	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets ; all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine hath overcome , because of the , and because of the words of his holiness .
24:23:010:0	For the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
24:23:011:0	For both prophet and priest are profane ; yea , in my house have I found their wickedness , saith the .
24:23:012:0	Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , saith the .
24:23:013:0	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria ; they prophesied in Baal , and caused my people Israel to err .
24:23:014:0	I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing : they commit adultery , and walk in lies : they strengthen also the hands of evildoers , that none doth return from his wickedness : they are all of them unto me as Sodom , and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah .
24:23:015:0	Therefore thus saith the of hosts concerning the prophets ; Behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
24:23:016:0	Thus saith the of hosts , Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you : they make you vain : they speak a vision of their own heart , and not out of the mouth of the .
24:23:017:0	They say still unto them that despise me , The hath said , Ye shall have peace ; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart , No evil shall come upon you .
24:23:018:0	For who hath stood in the counsel of the , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
24:23:019:0	Behold , a whirlwind of the is gone forth in fury , even a grievous whirlwind : it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked .
24:23:020:0	The anger of the shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
24:23:021:0	I have not sent these prophets , yet they ran : I have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied .
24:23:022:0	But if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
24:23:023:0	Am I a God at hand , saith the , and not a God afar off ?
24:23:024:0	Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him ? saith the . Do not I fill heaven and earth ? saith the .
24:23:025:0	I have heard what the prophets said , that prophesy lies in my name , saying , I have dreamed , I have dreamed .
24:23:026:0	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies ? yea , they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ;
24:23:027:0	Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal .
24:23:028:0	The prophet that hath a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hath my word , let him speak my word faithfully . What is the chaff to the wheat ? saith the .
24:23:029:0	Is not my word like as a fire ? saith the ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ?
24:23:030:0	Therefore , behold , I am against the prophets , saith the , that steal my words every one from his neighbour .
24:23:031:0	Behold , I am against the prophets , saith the , that use their tongues , and say , He saith .
24:23:032:0	Behold , I am against them that prophesy false dreams , saith the , and do tell them , and cause my people to err by their lies , and by their lightness ; yet I sent them not , nor commanded them : therefore they shall not profit this people at all , saith the .
24:23:033:0	And when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , saying , What is the burden of the ? thou shalt then say unto them , What burden ? I will even forsake you , saith the .
24:23:034:0	And as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , The burden of the , I will even punish that man and his house .
24:23:035:0	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , What hath the answered ? and , What hath the spoken ?
24:23:036:0	And the burden of the shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of the of hosts our God .
24:23:037:0	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet , What hath the answered thee ? and , What hath the spoken ?
24:23:038:0	But since ye say , The burden of the ; therefore thus saith the ; Because ye say this word , The burden of the , and I have sent unto you , saying , Ye shall not say , The burden of the ;
24:23:039:0	Therefore , behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will forsake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence :
24:23:040:0	And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
