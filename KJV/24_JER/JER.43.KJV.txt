24:43:001:0	And it came to pass , that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the their God , for which the their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
24:43:002:0	Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the proud men , saying unto Jeremiah , Thou speakest falsely : the our God hath not sent thee to say , Go not into Egypt to sojourn there :
24:43:003:0	But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
24:43:004:0	So Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the , to dwell in the land of Judah .
24:43:005:0	But Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
24:43:006:0	Even men , and women , and children , and the king 's daughters , and every person that Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Jeremiah the prophet , and Baruch the son of Neriah .
24:43:007:0	So they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the : thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
24:43:008:0	Then came the word of the unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
24:43:009:0	Take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
24:43:010:0	And say unto them , Thus saith the of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon , my servant , and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid ; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them .
24:43:011:0	And when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
24:43:012:0	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt ; and he shall burn them , and carry them away captives : and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt , as a shepherd putteth on his garment ; and he shall go forth from thence in peace .
24:43:013:0	He shall break also the images of Beth–shemesh , that is in the land of Egypt ; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire .
