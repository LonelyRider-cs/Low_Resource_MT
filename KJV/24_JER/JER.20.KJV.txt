24:20:001:0	Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest , who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things .
24:20:002:0	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
24:20:003:0	And it came to pass on the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . Then said Jeremiah unto him , The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur , but Magorâ€“missabib .
24:20:004:0	For thus saith the Lord , Behold , I will make thee a terror to thyself , and to all thy friends : and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies , and thine eyes shall behold it : and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall carry them captive into Babylon , and shall slay them with the sword .
24:20:005:0	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the labours thereof , and all the precious things thereof , and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies , which shall spoil them , and take them , and carry them to Babylon .
24:20:006:0	And thou , Pashur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity : and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophesied lies .
24:20:007:0	O Lord , thou hast deceived me , and I was deceived : thou art stronger than I , and hast prevailed : I am in derision daily , every one mocketh me .
24:20:008:0	For since I spake , I cried out , I cried violence and spoil ; because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me , and a derision , daily .
24:20:009:0	Then I said , I will not make mention of him , nor speak any more in his name . But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones , and I was weary with forbearing , and I could not stay .
24:20:010:0	For I heard the defaming of many , fear on every side . Report , say they , and we will report it . All my familiars watched for my halting , saying , Peradventure he will be enticed , and we shall prevail against him , and we shall take our revenge on him .
24:20:011:0	But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
24:20:012:0	But , O Lord of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
24:20:013:0	Sing unto the Lord , praise ye the Lord : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers .
24:20:014:0	Cursed be the day wherein I was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed .
24:20:015:0	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , A man child is born unto thee ; making him very glad .
24:20:016:0	And let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew , and repented not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the shouting at noontide ;
24:20:017:0	Because he slew me not from the womb ; or that my mother might have been my grave , and her womb to be always great with me .
24:20:018:0	Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
