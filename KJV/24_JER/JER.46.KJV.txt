24:46:003:0	Order ye the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle .
24:46:004:0	Harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines .
24:46:005:0	Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the .
24:46:006:0	Let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates .
24:46:007:0	Who is this that cometh up as a flood , whose waters are moved as the rivers ?
24:46:008:0	Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
24:46:009:0	Come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Ludim , that handle and bend the bow .
24:46:010:0	For this is the day of the Lord of hosts , a day of vengeance , that he may avenge him of his adversaries : and the sword shall devour , and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood : for the Lord of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates .

24:46:014:0	Declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
24:46:015:0	Why are thy valiant men swept away ? they stood not , because the did drive them .
24:46:016:0	He made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , Arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
24:46:017:0	They did cry there , Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ; he hath passed the time appointed .
24:46:018:0	As I live , saith the King , whose name is the of hosts , Surely as Tabor is among the mountains , and as Carmel by the sea , so shall he come .

24:46:020:0	Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
24:46:021:0	Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
