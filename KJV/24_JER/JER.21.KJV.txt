24:21:001:0	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the , when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Malchijah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , saying ,
24:21:002:0	Enquire , I pray thee , of the for us ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us ; if so be that the will deal with us according to all his wondrous works , that he may go up from us .
24:21:003:0	Then said Jeremiah unto them , Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah :
24:21:004:0	Thus saith the God of Israel ; Behold , I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands , wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon , and against the Chaldeans , which besiege you without the walls , and I will assemble them into the midst of this city .
24:21:005:0	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
24:21:006:0	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
24:21:007:0	And afterward , saith the , I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah , and his servants , and the people , and such as are left in this city from the pestilence , from the sword , and from the famine , into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those that seek their life : and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword ; he shall not spare them , neither have pity , nor have mercy .
24:21:008:0	And unto this people thou shalt say , Thus saith the ; Behold , I set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
24:21:009:0	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth out , and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
24:21:010:0	For I have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith the : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
24:21:011:0	And touching the house of the king of Judah , say , Hear ye the word of the ;
24:21:012:0	O house of David , thus saith the ; Execute judgment in the morning , and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor , lest my fury go out like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
24:21:013:0	Behold , I am against thee , O inhabitant of the valley , and rock of the plain , saith the ; which say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
24:21:014:0	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the : and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it .
