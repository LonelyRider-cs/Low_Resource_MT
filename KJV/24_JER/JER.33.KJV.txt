24:33:001:0	Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
24:33:002:0	Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof , the Lord that formed it , to establish it ; the Lord is his name ;
24:33:003:0	Call unto me , and I will answer thee , and shew thee great and mighty things , which thou knowest not .
24:33:004:0	For thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down by the mounts , and by the sword ;
24:33:005:0	They come to fight with the Chaldeans , but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city .
24:33:006:0	Behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them , and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
24:33:007:0	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
24:33:008:0	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
24:33:009:0	And it shall be to me a name of joy , a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth , which shall hear all the good that I do unto them : and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it .
24:33:010:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Again there shall be heard in this place , which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast , even in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , that are desolate , without man , and without inhabitant , and without beast ,
24:33:011:0	The voice of joy , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the voice of them that shall say , Praise the Lord of hosts : for the Lord is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever : and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord . For I will cause to return the captivity of the land , as at the first , saith the Lord .
24:33:012:0	Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Again in this place , which is desolate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
24:33:013:0	In the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the vale , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them , saith the Lord .
24:33:014:0	Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
24:33:015:0	In those days , and at that time , will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
24:33:016:0	In those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The Lord our righteousness .
24:33:017:0	For thus saith the Lord ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
24:33:018:0	Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings , and to kindle meat offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
24:33:019:0	And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah , saying ,
24:33:020:0	Thus saith the Lord ; If ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ;
24:33:021:0	Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant , that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne ; and with the Levites the priests , my ministers .
24:33:022:0	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured : so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites that minister unto me .
24:33:023:0	Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying ,
24:33:024:0	Considerest thou not what this people have spoken , saying , The two families which the Lord hath chosen , he hath even cast them off ? thus they have despised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
24:33:025:0	Thus saith the Lord ; If my covenant be not with day and night , and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ;
24:33:026:0	Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob , and David my servant , so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will cause their captivity to return , and have mercy on them .
