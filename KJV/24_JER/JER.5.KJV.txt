24:5:001:0	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places thereof , if ye can find a man , if there be any that executeth judgment , that seeketh the truth ; and I will pardon it .
24:5:002:0	And though they say , The Lord liveth ; surely they swear falsely .
24:5:003:0	O Lord , are not thine eyes upon the truth ? thou hast stricken them , but they have not grieved ; thou hast consumed them , but they have refused to receive correction : they have made their faces harder than a rock ; they have refused to return .
24:5:004:0	Therefore I said , Surely these are poor ; they are foolish : for they know not the way of the Lord , nor the judgment of their God .
24:5:005:0	I will get me unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
24:5:006:0	Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them , and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them , a leopard shall watch over their cities : every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces : because their transgressions are many , and their backslidings are increased .
24:5:007:0	How shall I pardon thee for this ? thy children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses .
24:5:008:0	They were as fed horses in the morning : every one neighed after his neighbour's wife .
24:5:009:0	Shall I not visit for these things ? saith the Lord : and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
24:5:010:0	Go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her battlements ; for they are not the Lord's .
24:5:011:0	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith the Lord .
24:5:012:0	They have belied the Lord , and said , It is not he ; neither shall evil come upon us ; neither shall we see sword nor famine :
24:5:013:0	And the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done unto them .
24:5:014:0	Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts , Because ye speak this word , behold , I will make my words in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour them .
24:5:015:0	Lo , I will bring a nation upon you from far , O house of Israel , saith the Lord : it is a mighty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither understandest what they say .
24:5:016:0	Their quiver is as an open sepulchre , they are all mighty men .
24:5:017:0	And they shall eat up thine harvest , and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat : they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds : they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees : they shall impoverish thy fenced cities , wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
24:5:018:0	Nevertheless in those days , saith the Lord , I will not make a full end with you .
24:5:019:0	And it shall come to pass , when ye shall say , Wherefore doeth the Lord our God all these things unto us ? then shalt thou answer them , Like as ye have forsaken me , and served strange gods in your land , so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours .
24:5:020:0	Declare this in the house of Jacob , and publish it in Judah , saying ,
24:5:021:0	Hear now this , O foolish people , and without understanding ; which have eyes , and see not ; which have ears , and hear not :
24:5:022:0	Fear ye not me ? saith the Lord : will ye not tremble at my presence , which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree , that it cannot pass it : and though the waves thereof toss themselves , yet can they not prevail ; though they roar , yet can they not pass over it ?
24:5:023:0	But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they are revolted and gone .
24:5:024:0	Neither say they in their heart , Let us now fear the Lord our God , that giveth rain , both the former and the latter , in his season : he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest .
24:5:025:0	Your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden good things from you .
24:5:026:0	For among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
24:5:027:0	As a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxen rich .
24:5:028:0	They are waxen fat , they shine : yea , they overpass the deeds of the wicked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , yet they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not judge .
24:5:029:0	Shall I not visit for these things ? saith the Lord : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
24:5:030:0	A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land ;
24:5:031:0	The prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end thereof ?
