24:28:001:0	And it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet , which was of Gibeon , spake unto me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
24:28:002:0	Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
24:28:003:0	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
24:28:004:0	And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , that went into Babylon , saith the Lord : for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
24:28:005:0	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord ,
24:28:006:0	Even the prophet Jeremiah said , Amen : the Lord do so : the Lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied , to bring again the vessels of the Lord's house , and all that is carried away captive , from Babylon into this place .
24:28:007:0	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
24:28:008:0	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
24:28:009:0	The prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the Lord hath truly sent him .
24:28:010:0	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck , and brake it .
24:28:011:0	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people , saying , Thus saith the Lord ; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years . And the prophet Jeremiah went his way .
24:28:012:0	Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
24:28:013:0	Go and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus saith the Lord ; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood ; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron .
24:28:014:0	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations , that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and they shall serve him : and I have given him the beasts of the field also .
24:28:015:0	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah ; The Lord hath not sent thee ; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
24:28:016:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord .
24:28:017:0	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
