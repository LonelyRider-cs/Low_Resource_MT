24:42:001:0	Then all the captains of the forces , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , came near ,
24:42:002:0	And said unto Jeremiah the prophet , Let , we beseech thee , our supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for us unto the thy God , even for all this remnant ; ( for we are left but a few of many , as thine eyes do behold us : )
24:42:003:0	That the thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk , and the thing that we may do .
24:42:004:0	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray unto the your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that whatsoever thing the shall answer you , I will declare it unto you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
24:42:005:0	Then they said to Jeremiah , The be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the thy God shall send thee to us .
24:42:006:0	Whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the our God , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of the our God .
24:42:007:0	And it came to pass after ten days , that the word of the came unto Jeremiah .
24:42:008:0	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
24:42:009:0	And said unto them , Thus saith the , the God of Israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him ;
24:42:010:0	If ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up : for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you .
24:42:011:0	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
24:42:012:0	And I will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
24:42:013:0	But if ye say , We will not dwell in this land , neither obey the voice of the your God ,
24:42:014:0	Saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
24:42:015:0	And now therefore hear the word of the , ye remnant of Judah ; Thus saith the of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ;
24:42:016:0	Then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
24:42:017:0	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them .
24:42:018:0	For thus saith the of hosts , the God of Israel ; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you , when ye shall enter into Egypt : and ye shall be an execration , and an astonishment , and a curse , and a reproach ; and ye shall see this place no more .
24:42:019:0	The hath said concerning you , O ye remnant of Judah ; Go ye not into Egypt : know certainly that I have admonished you this day .
24:42:020:0	For ye dissembled in your hearts , when ye sent me unto the your God , saying , Pray for us unto the our God ; and according unto all that the our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it .
24:42:021:0	And now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
24:42:022:0	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
