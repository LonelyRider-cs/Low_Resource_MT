24:16:001:0	The word of the Lord came also unto me , saying ,
24:16:002:0	Thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place .
24:16:003:0	For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that bare them , and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land ;
24:16:004:0	They shall die of grievous deaths ; they shall not be lamented ; neither shall they be buried ; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth : and they shall be consumed by the sword , and by famine ; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven , and for the beasts of the earth .
24:16:005:0	For thus saith the Lord , Enter not into the house of mourning , neither go to lament nor bemoan them : for I have taken away my peace from this people , saith the Lord , even lovingkindness and mercies .
24:16:006:0	Both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them :
24:16:007:0	Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
24:16:008:0	Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting , to sit with them to eat and to drink .
24:16:009:0	For thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride .
24:16:010:0	And it shall come to pass , when thou shalt shew this people all these words , and they shall say unto thee , Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us ? or what is our iniquity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ?
24:16:011:0	Then shalt thou say unto them , Because your fathers have forsaken me , saith the Lord , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have worshipped them , and have forsaken me , and have not kept my law ;
24:16:012:0	And ye have done worse than your fathers ; for , behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart , that they may not hearken unto me :
24:16:013:0	Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not , neither ye nor your fathers ; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night ; where I will not shew you favour .
24:16:014:0	Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be said , The Lord liveth , that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
24:16:015:0	But , The Lord liveth , that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither he had driven them : and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers .
24:16:016:0	Behold , I will send for many fishers , saith the Lord , and they shall fish them ; and after will I send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
24:16:017:0	For mine eyes are upon all their ways : they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes .
24:16:018:0	And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double ; because they have defiled my land , they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things .
24:16:019:0	O Lord , my strength , and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of affliction , the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Surely our fathers have inherited lies , vanity , and things wherein there is no profit .
24:16:020:0	Shall a man make gods unto himself , and they are no gods ?
24:16:021:0	Therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The Lord .
