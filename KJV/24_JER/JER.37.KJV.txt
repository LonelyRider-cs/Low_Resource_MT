24:37:001:0	And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
24:37:002:0	But neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
24:37:003:0	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Pray now unto the our God for us .
24:37:004:0	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people : for they had not put him into prison .
24:37:005:0	Then Pharaoh 's army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
24:37:006:0	Then came the word of the unto the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
24:37:007:0	Thus saith the , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to enquire of me ; Behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
24:37:008:0	And the Chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and burn it with fire .
24:37:009:0	Thus saith the ; Deceive not yourselves , saying , The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us : for they shall not depart .
24:37:010:0	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
24:37:011:0	And it came to pass , that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
24:37:012:0	Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin , to separate himself thence in the midst of the people .
24:37:013:0	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he took Jeremiah the prophet , saying , Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans .
24:37:014:0	Then said Jeremiah , It is false ; I fall not away to the Chaldeans . But he hearkened not to him : so Irijah took Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
24:37:015:0	Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
24:37:016:0	When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon , and into the cabins , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
24:37:017:0	Then Zedekiah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the ? And Jeremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
24:37:018:0	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah , What have I offended against thee , or against thy servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ?
24:37:019:0	Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
24:37:020:0	Therefore hear now , I pray thee , O my lord the king : let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee ; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
24:37:021:0	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
