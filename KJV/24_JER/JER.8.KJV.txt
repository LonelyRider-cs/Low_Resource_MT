24:8:001:0	At that time , saith the Lord , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , out of their graves :
24:8:002:0	And they shall spread them before the sun , and the moon , and all the host of heaven , whom they have loved , and whom they have served , and after whom they have walked , and whom they have sought , and whom they have worshipped : they shall not be gathered , nor be buried ; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth .
24:8:003:0	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whither I have driven them , saith the Lord of hosts .
24:8:004:0	Moreover thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord ; Shall they fall , and not arise ? shall he turn away , and not return ?
24:8:005:0	Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
24:8:006:0	I hearkened and heard , but they spake not aright : no man repented him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? every one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
24:8:007:0	Yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
24:8:008:0	How do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the Lord is with us ? Lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
24:8:009:0	The wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wisdom is in them ?
24:8:010:0	Therefore will I give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
24:8:011:0	For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
24:8:012:0	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , saith the Lord .
24:8:013:0	I will surely consume them , saith the Lord : there shall be no grapes on the vine , nor figs on the fig tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them .
24:8:014:0	Why do we sit still ? assemble yourselves , and let us enter into the defenced cities , and let us be silent there : for the Lord our God hath put us to silence , and given us water of gall to drink , because we have sinned against the Lord .
24:8:015:0	We looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of health , and behold trouble !
24:8:016:0	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan : the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones ; for they are come , and have devoured the land , and all that is in it ; the city , and those that dwell therein .
24:8:017:0	For , behold , I will send serpents , cockatrices , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , saith the Lord .
24:8:018:0	When I would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart is faint in me .
24:8:019:0	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country : Is not the Lord in Zion ? is not her king in her ? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images , and with strange vanities ?
24:8:020:0	The harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
24:8:021:0	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; astonishment hath taken hold on me .
24:8:022:0	Is there no balm in Gilead ; is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
