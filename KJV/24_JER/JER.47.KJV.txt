24:47:001:0	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines , before that Pharaoh smote Gaza .
24:47:002:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl .
24:47:003:0	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
24:47:004:0	Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines , and to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth : for the Lord will spoil the Philistines , the remnant of the country of Caphtor .
24:47:005:0	Baldness is come upon Gaza ; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley : how long wilt thou cut thyself ?
24:47:006:0	O thou sword of the Lord , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy scabbard , rest , and be still .
24:47:007:0	How can it be quiet , seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon , and against the sea shore ? there hath he appointed it .
