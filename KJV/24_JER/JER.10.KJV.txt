24:10:001:0	Hear ye the word which the speaketh unto you , O house of Israel :
24:10:002:0	Thus saith the , Learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them .
24:10:003:0	For the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
24:10:004:0	They deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
24:10:005:0	They are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they can not go . Be not afraid of them ; for they can not do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
24:10:006:0	Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee , O ; thou art great , and thy name is great in might .
24:10:007:0	Who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee .
24:10:008:0	But they are altogether brutish and foolish : the stock is a doctrine of vanities .
24:10:009:0	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
24:10:010:0	But the is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
24:10:011:0	Thus shall ye say unto them , The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heavens .
24:10:012:0	He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion .
24:10:013:0	When he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
24:10:014:0	Every man is brutish in his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
24:10:015:0	They are vanity , and the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
24:10:016:0	The portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : The of hosts is his name .
24:10:017:0	Gather up thy wares out of the land , O inhabitant of the fortress .
24:10:018:0	For thus saith the , Behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
24:10:019:0	Woe is me for my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but I said , Truly this is a grief , and I must bear it .
24:10:020:0	My tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
24:10:021:0	For the pastors are become brutish , and have not sought the : therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flocks shall be scattered .
24:10:022:0	Behold , the noise of the bruit is come , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah desolate , and a den of dragons .
24:10:023:0	O , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
24:10:024:0	O , correct me , but with judgment ; not in thine anger , lest thou bring me to nothing .
24:10:025:0	Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not , and upon the families that call not on thy name : for they have eaten up Jacob , and devoured him , and consumed him , and have made his habitation desolate .
