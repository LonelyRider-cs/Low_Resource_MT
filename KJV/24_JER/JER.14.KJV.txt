24:14:001:0	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth .
24:14:002:0	Judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish ; they are black unto the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
24:14:003:0	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
24:14:004:0	Because the ground is chapt , for there was no rain in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed , they covered their heads .
24:14:005:0	Yea , the hind also calved in the field , and forsook it , because there was no grass .
24:14:006:0	And the wild asses did stand in the high places , they snuffed up the wind like dragons ; their eyes did fail , because there was no grass .
24:14:007:0	O Lord , though our iniquities testify against us , do thou it for thy name's sake : for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned against thee .
24:14:008:0	O the hope of Israel , the saviour thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night ?
24:14:009:0	Why shouldest thou be as a man astonished , as a mighty man that cannot save ? yet thou , O Lord , art in the midst of us , and we are called by thy name ; leave us not .
24:14:010:0	Thus saith the Lord unto this people , Thus have they loved to wander , they have not refrained their feet , therefore the Lord doth not accept them ; he will now remember their iniquity , and visit their sins .
24:14:011:0	Then said the Lord unto me , Pray not for this people for their good .
24:14:012:0	When they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation , I will not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
24:14:013:0	Then said I , Ah , Lord God ! behold , the prophets say unto them , Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but I will give you assured peace in this place .
24:14:014:0	Then the Lord said unto me , The prophets prophesy lies in my name : I sent them not , neither have I commanded them , neither spake unto them : they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination , and a thing of nought , and the deceit of their heart .
24:14:015:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name , and I sent them not , yet they say , Sword and famine shall not be in this land ; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed .
24:14:016:0	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them , them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters : for I will pour their wickedness upon them .
24:14:017:0	Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
24:14:018:0	If I go forth into the field , then behold the slain with the sword ! and if I enter into the city , then behold them that are sick with famine ! yea , both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not .
24:14:019:0	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah ? hath thy soul lothed Zion ? why hast thou smitten us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
24:14:020:0	We acknowledge , O Lord , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers : for we have sinned against thee .
24:14:021:0	Do not abhor us , for thy name's sake , do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
24:14:022:0	Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain ? or can the heavens give showers ? art not thou he , O Lord our God ? therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
