24:6:001:0	O ye children of Benjamin , gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem , and blow the trumpet in Tekoa , and set up a sign of fire in Bethâ€“haccerem : for evil appeareth out of the north , and great destruction .
24:6:002:0	I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman .
24:6:003:0	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
24:6:004:0	Prepare ye war against her ; arise , and let us go up at noon . Woe unto us ! for the day goeth away , for the shadows of the evening are stretched out .
24:6:005:0	Arise , and let us go by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
24:6:006:0	For thus hath the of hosts said , Hew ye down trees , and cast a mount against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
24:6:007:0	As a fountain casteth out her waters , so she casteth out her wickedness : violence and spoil is heard in her ; before me continually is grief and wounds .
24:6:008:0	Be thou instructed , O Jerusalem , lest my soul depart from thee ; lest I make thee desolate , a land not inhabited .
24:6:009:0	Thus saith the of hosts , They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine : turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets .
24:6:010:0	To whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they can not hearken : behold , the word of the is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
24:6:011:0	Therefore I am full of the fury of the ; I am weary with holding in : I will pour it out upon the children abroad , and upon the assembly of young men together : for even the husband with the wife shall be taken , the aged with him that is full of days .
24:6:012:0	And their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , saith the .
24:6:013:0	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
24:6:014:0	They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
24:6:015:0	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall : at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down , saith the .
24:6:016:0	Thus saith the , Stand ye in the ways , and see , and ask for the old paths , where is the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls . But they said , We will not walk therein .
24:6:017:0	Also I set watchmen over you , saying , Hearken to the sound of the trumpet . But they said , We will not hearken .
24:6:018:0	Therefore hear , ye nations , and know , O congregation , what is among them .
24:6:019:0	Hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hearkened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
24:6:020:0	To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices sweet unto me .
24:6:021:0	Therefore thus saith the , Behold , I will lay stumblingblocks before this people , and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them ; the neighbour and his friend shall perish .
24:6:022:0	Thus saith the , Behold , a people cometh from the north country , and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth .
24:6:023:0	They shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Zion .
24:6:024:0	We have heard the fame thereof : our hands wax feeble : anguish hath taken hold of us , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
24:6:025:0	Go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
24:6:026:0	O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us .
24:6:027:0	I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people , that thou mayest know and try their way .
24:6:028:0	They are all grievous revolters , walking with slanders : they are brass and iron ; they are all corrupters .
24:6:029:0	The bellows are burned , the lead is consumed of the fire ; the founder melteth in vain : for the wicked are not plucked away .
24:6:030:0	Reprobate silver shall men call them , because the hath rejected them .
