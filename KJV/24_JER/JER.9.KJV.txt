24:9:001:0	Oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
24:9:002:0	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
24:9:003:0	And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith the Lord .
24:9:004:0	Take ye heed every one of his neighbour , and trust ye not in any brother : for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbour will walk with slanders .
24:9:005:0	And they will deceive every one his neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies , and weary themselves to commit iniquity .
24:9:006:0	Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , saith the Lord .
24:9:007:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , Behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people ?
24:9:008:0	Their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he layeth his wait .
24:9:009:0	Shall I not visit them for these things ? saith the Lord : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
24:9:010:0	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing , and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation , because they are burned up , so that none can pass through them ; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle ; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled ; they are gone .
24:9:011:0	And I will make Jerusalem heaps , and a den of dragons ; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate , without an inhabitant .
24:9:012:0	Who is the wise man , that may understand this ? and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken , that he may declare it , for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness , that none passeth through ?
24:9:013:0	And the Lord saith , Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ;
24:9:014:0	But have walked after the imagination of their own heart , and after Baalim , which their fathers taught them :
24:9:015:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
24:9:016:0	I will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and I will send a sword after them , till I have consumed them .
24:9:017:0	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , Consider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for cunning women , that they may come :
24:9:018:0	And let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
24:9:019:0	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we spoiled ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because our dwellings have cast us out .
24:9:020:0	Yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbour lamentation .
24:9:021:0	For death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
24:9:022:0	Speak , Thus saith the Lord , Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field , and as the handful after the harvestman , and none shall gather them .
24:9:023:0	Thus saith the Lord , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches :
24:9:024:0	But let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth me , that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , saith the Lord .
24:9:025:0	Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised ;
24:9:026:0	Egypt , and Judah , and Edom , and the children of Ammon , and Moab , and all that are in the utmost corners , that dwell in the wilderness : for all these nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart .
