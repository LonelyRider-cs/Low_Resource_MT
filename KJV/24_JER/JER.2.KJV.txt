24:2:001:0	Moreover the word of the came to me , saying ,
24:2:002:0	Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , Thus saith the ; I remember thee , the kindness of thy youth , the love of thine espousals , when thou wentest after me in the wilderness , in a land that was not sown .
24:2:003:0	Israel was holiness unto the , and the firstfruits of his increase : all that devour him shall offend ; evil shall come upon them , saith the .
24:2:004:0	Hear ye the word of the , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel :
24:2:005:0	Thus saith the , What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
24:2:006:0	Neither said they , Where is the that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , that led us through the wilderness , through a land of deserts and of pits , through a land of drought , and of the shadow of death , through a land that no man passed through , and where no man dwelt ?
24:2:007:0	And I brought you into a plentiful country , to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof ; but when ye entered , ye defiled my land , and made mine heritage an abomination .
24:2:008:0	The priests said not , Where is the ? and they that handle the law knew me not : the pastors also transgressed against me , and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after things that do not profit .
24:2:009:0	Wherefore I will yet plead with you , saith the , and with your children 's children will I plead .
24:2:010:0	For pass over the isles of Kittim , and see ; and send unto Kedar , and consider diligently , and see if there be such a thing .
24:2:011:0	Hath a nation changed their gods , which are yet no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit .
24:2:012:0	Be astonished , O ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith the .
24:2:013:0	For my people have committed two evils ; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters , and hewed them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
24:2:014:0	Is Israel a servant ? is he a homeborn slave ? why is he spoiled ?
24:2:015:0	The young lions roared upon him , and yelled , and they made his land waste : his cities are burned without inhabitant .
24:2:016:0	Also the children of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head .
24:2:017:0	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the thy God , when he led thee by the way ?
24:2:018:0	And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the river ?
24:2:019:0	Thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backslidings shall reprove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsaken the thy God , and that my fear is not in thee , saith the Lord of hosts .
24:2:020:0	For of old time I have broken thy yoke , and burst thy bands ; and thou saidst , I will not transgress ; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , playing the harlot .
24:2:021:0	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me ?
24:2:022:0	For though thou wash thee with nitre , and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity is marked before me , saith the Lord .
24:2:023:0	How canst thou say , I am not polluted , I have not gone after Baalim ? see thy way in the valley , know what thou hast done : thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways ;
24:2:024:0	A wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
24:2:025:0	Withhold thy foot from being unshod , and thy throat from thirst : but thou saidst , There is no hope : no ; for I have loved strangers , and after them will I go .
24:2:026:0	As the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ,
24:2:027:0	Saying to a stock , Thou art my father ; and to a stone , Thou hast brought me forth : for they have turned their back unto me , and not their face : but in the time of their trouble they will say , Arise , and save us .
24:2:028:0	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods , O Judah .
24:2:029:0	Wherefore will ye plead with me ? ye all have transgressed against me , saith the .
24:2:030:0	In vain have I smitten your children ; they received no correction : your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
24:2:031:0	O generation , see ye the word of the . Have I been a wilderness unto Israel ? a land of darkness ? wherefore say my people , We are lords ; we will come no more unto thee ?
24:2:032:0	Can a maid forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
24:2:033:0	Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love ? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways .
24:2:034:0	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents : I have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
24:2:035:0	Yet thou sayest , Because I am innocent , surely his anger shall turn from me . Behold , I will plead with thee , because thou sayest , I have not sinned .
24:2:036:0	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt , as thou wast ashamed of Assyria .
24:2:037:0	Yea , thou shalt go forth from him , and thine hands upon thine head : for the hath rejected thy confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
