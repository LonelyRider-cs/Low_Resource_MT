24:15:001:0	Then said the unto me , Though Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind could not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
24:15:002:0	And it shall come to pass , if they say unto thee , Whither shall we go forth ? then thou shalt tell them , Thus saith the ; Such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword ; and such as are for the famine , to the famine ; and such as are for the captivity , to the captivity .
24:15:003:0	And I will appoint over them four kinds , saith the : the sword to slay , and the dogs to tear , and the fowls of the heaven , and the beasts of the earth , to devour and destroy .
24:15:004:0	And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
24:15:005:0	For who shall have pity upon thee , O Jerusalem ? or who shall bemoan thee ? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest ?
24:15:006:0	Thou hast forsaken me , saith the , thou art gone backward : therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee ; I am weary with repenting .
24:15:007:0	And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
24:15:008:0	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas : I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday : I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly , and terrors upon the city .
24:15:009:0	She that hath borne seven languisheth : she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day : she hath been ashamed and confounded : and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , saith the .
24:15:010:0	Woe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth ! I have neither lent on usury , nor men have lent to me on usury ; yet every one of them doth curse me .
24:15:011:0	The said , Verily it shall be well with thy remnant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
24:15:012:0	Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel ?
24:15:013:0	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
24:15:014:0	And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
24:15:015:0	O , thou knowest : remember me , and visit me , and revenge me of my persecutors ; take me not away in thy longsuffering : know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke .
24:15:016:0	Thy words were found , and I did eat them ; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart : for I am called by thy name , O God of hosts .
24:15:017:0	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of thy hand : for thou hast filled me with indignation .
24:15:018:0	Why is my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable , which refuseth to be healed ? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar , and as waters that fail ?
24:15:019:0	Therefore thus saith the , If thou return , then will I bring thee again , and thou shalt stand before me : and if thou take forth the precious from the vile , thou shalt be as my mouth : let them return unto thee ; but return not thou unto them .
24:15:020:0	And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , saith the .
24:15:021:0	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
