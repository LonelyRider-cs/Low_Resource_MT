24:39:001:0	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they besieged it .
24:39:002:0	And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
24:39:003:0	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in , and sat in the middle gate , even Nergal–sharezer , Samgar–nebo , Sarsechim , Rab–saris , Nergal–sharezer , Rab–mag , with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon .
24:39:004:0	And it came to pass , that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king's garden , by the gate betwixt the two walls : and he went out the way of the plain .
24:39:005:0	But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
24:39:006:0	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
24:39:007:0	Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes , and bound him with chains , to carry him to Babylon .
24:39:008:0	And the Chaldeans burned the king's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of Jerusalem .
24:39:009:0	Then Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
24:39:010:0	But Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
24:39:011:0	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard , saying ,
24:39:012:0	Take him , and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee .
24:39:013:0	So Nebuzar–adan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushasban , Rab–saris , and Nergal–sharezer , Rab–mag , and all the king of Babylon's princes ;
24:39:014:0	Even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
24:39:015:0	Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
24:39:016:0	Go and speak to Ebed–melech the Ethiopian , saying , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring my words upon this city for evil , and not for good ; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee .
24:39:017:0	But I will deliver thee in that day , saith the Lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
24:39:018:0	For I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put thy trust in me , saith the Lord .
