24:3:001:0	They say , If a man put away his wife , and she go from him , and become another man 's , shall he return unto her again ? shall not that land be greatly polluted ? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers ; yet return again to me , saith the .
24:3:002:0	Lift up thine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been lien with . In the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness .
24:3:003:0	Therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; and thou hadst a whore 's forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
24:3:004:0	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me , My father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
24:3:005:0	Will he reserve his anger for ever ? will he keep it to the end ? Behold , thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest .
24:3:006:0	The said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king , Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done ? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the harlot .
24:3:007:0	And I said after she had done all these things , Turn thou unto me . But she returned not . And her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
24:3:008:0	And I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
24:3:009:0	And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that she defiled the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
24:3:010:0	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart , but feignedly , saith the .
24:3:011:0	And the said unto me , The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah .
24:3:012:0	Go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou backsliding Israel , saith the ; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for I am merciful , saith the , and I will not keep anger for ever .
24:3:013:0	Only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the thy God , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the .
24:3:014:0	Turn , O backsliding children , saith the ; for I am married unto you : and I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion :
24:3:015:0	And I will give you pastors according to mine heart , which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
24:3:016:0	And it shall come to pass , when ye be multiplied and increased in the land , in those days , saith the , they shall say no more , The ark of the covenant of the : neither shall it come to mind : neither shall they remember it ; neither shall they visit it ; neither shall that be done any more .
24:3:017:0	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the , to Jerusalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart .
24:3:018:0	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
24:3:019:0	But I said , How shall I put thee among the children , and give thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations ? and I said , Thou shalt call me , My father ; and shalt not turn away from me .
24:3:020:0	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband , so have ye dealt treacherously with me , O house of Israel , saith the .
24:3:021:0	A voice was heard upon the high places , weeping and supplications of the children of Israel : for they have perverted their way , and they have forgotten the their God .
24:3:022:0	Return , ye backsliding children , and I will heal your backslidings . Behold , we come unto thee ; for thou art the our God .
24:3:023:0	Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the our God is the salvation of Israel .
24:3:024:0	For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth ; their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
24:3:025:0	We lie down in our shame , and our confusion covereth us : for we have sinned against the our God , we and our fathers , from our youth even unto this day , and have not obeyed the voice of the our God .
