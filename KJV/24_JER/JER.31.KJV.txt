24:31:001:0	At the same time , saith the Lord , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
24:31:002:0	Thus saith the Lord , The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness ; even Israel , when I went to cause him to rest .
24:31:003:0	The Lord hath appeared of old unto me , saying , Yea , I have loved thee with an everlasting love : therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee .
24:31:004:0	Again I will build thee , and thou shalt be built , O virgin of Israel : thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
24:31:005:0	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria : the planters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
24:31:006:0	For there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry , Arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God .
24:31:007:0	For thus saith the Lord ; Sing with gladness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , O Lord , save thy people , the remnant of Israel .
24:31:008:0	Behold , I will bring them from the north country , and gather them from the coasts of the earth , and with them the blind and the lame , the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together : a great company shall return thither .
24:31:009:0	They shall come with weeping , and with supplications will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way , wherein they shall not stumble : for I am a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
24:31:010:0	Hear the word of the Lord , O ye nations , and declare it in the isles afar off , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd doth his flock .
24:31:011:0	For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob , and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
24:31:012:0	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion , and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord , for wheat , and for wine , and for oil , and for the young of the flock and of the herd : and their soul shall be as a watered garden ; and they shall not sorrow any more at all .
24:31:013:0	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
24:31:014:0	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , saith the Lord .
24:31:015:0	Thus saith the Lord ; A voice was heard in Ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping ; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children , because they were not .
24:31:016:0	Thus saith the Lord ; Refrain thy voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears : for thy work shall be rewarded , saith the Lord ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
24:31:017:0	And there is hope in thine end , saith the Lord , that thy children shall come again to their own border .
24:31:018:0	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus ; Thou hast chastised me , and I was chastised , as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke : turn thou me , and I shall be turned ; for thou art the Lord my God .
24:31:019:0	Surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
24:31:020:0	Is Ephraim my dear son ? is he a pleasant child ? for since I spake against him , I do earnestly remember him still : therefore my bowels are troubled for him ; I will surely have mercy upon him , saith the Lord .
24:31:021:0	Set thee up waymarks , make thee high heaps : set thine heart toward the highway , even the way which thou wentest : turn again , O virgin of Israel , turn again to these thy cities .
24:31:022:0	How long wilt thou go about , O thou backsliding daughter ? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth , A woman shall compass a man .
24:31:023:0	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof , when I shall bring again their captivity ; The Lord bless thee , O habitation of justice , and mountain of holiness .
24:31:024:0	And there shall dwell in Judah itself , and in all the cities thereof together , husbandmen , and they that go forth with flocks .
24:31:025:0	For I have satiated the weary soul , and I have replenished every sorrowful soul .
24:31:026:0	Upon this I awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
24:31:027:0	Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
24:31:028:0	And it shall come to pass , that like as I have watched over them , to pluck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to afflict ; so will I watch over them , to build , and to plant , saith the Lord .
24:31:029:0	In those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten a sour grape , and the children's teeth are set on edge .
24:31:030:0	But every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
24:31:031:0	Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
24:31:032:0	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my covenant they brake , although I was an husband unto them , saith the Lord :
24:31:033:0	But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel ; After those days , saith the Lord , I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their God , and they shall be my people .
24:31:034:0	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for they shall all know me , from the least of them unto the greatest of them , saith the Lord : for I will forgive their iniquity , and I will remember their sin no more .
24:31:035:0	Thus saith the Lord , which giveth the sun for a light by day , and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar ; The Lord of hosts is his name :
24:31:036:0	If those ordinances depart from before me , saith the Lord , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
24:31:037:0	Thus saith the Lord ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the Lord .
24:31:038:0	Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner .
24:31:039:0	And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb , and shall compass about to Goath .
24:31:040:0	And the whole valley of the dead bodies , and of the ashes , and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron , unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east , shall be holy unto the Lord ; it shall not be plucked up , nor thrown down any more for ever .
