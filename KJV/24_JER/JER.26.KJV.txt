24:26:001:0	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the , saying ,
24:26:002:0	Thus saith the ; Stand in the court of the house , and speak unto all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in the house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
24:26:003:0	If so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
24:26:004:0	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the ; If ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
24:26:005:0	To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
24:26:006:0	Then will I make this house like Shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
24:26:007:0	So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the .
24:26:008:0	Now it came to pass , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Thou shalt surely die .
24:26:009:0	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the , saying , This house shall be like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant ? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the .
24:26:010:0	When the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house unto the house of the , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the house .
24:26:011:0	Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears .
24:26:012:0	Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
24:26:013:0	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the your God ; and the will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
24:26:014:0	As for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you .
24:26:015:0	But know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
24:26:016:0	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the our God .
24:26:017:0	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
24:26:018:0	Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah , and spake to all the people of Judah , saying , Thus saith the of hosts ; Zion shall be plowed like a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
24:26:019:0	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death ? did he not fear the , and besought the , and the repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them ? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls .
24:26:020:0	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathâ€“jearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah :
24:26:021:0	And when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
24:26:022:0	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him into Egypt .
24:26:023:0	And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king ; who slew him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
24:26:024:0	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
