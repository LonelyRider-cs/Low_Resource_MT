24:34:001:0	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion , and all the people , fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
24:34:002:0	Thus saith the , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus saith the ; Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
24:34:003:0	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
24:34:004:0	Yet hear the word of the , O Zedekiah king of Judah ; Thus saith the of thee , Thou shalt not die by the sword :
24:34:005:0	But thou shalt die in peace : and with the burnings of thy fathers , the former kings which were before thee , so shall they burn odours for thee ; and they will lament thee , saying , Ah lord ! for I have pronounced the word , saith the .
24:34:006:0	Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem ,
24:34:007:0	When the king of Babylon 's army fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish , and against Azekah : for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah .
24:34:008:0	This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the , after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
24:34:009:0	That every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a Jew his brother .
24:34:010:0	Now when all the princes , and all the people , which had entered into the covenant , heard that every one should let his manservant , and every one his maidservant , go free , that none should serve themselves of them any more , then they obeyed , and let them go .
24:34:011:0	But afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
24:34:012:0	Therefore the word of the came to Jeremiah from the , saying ,
24:34:013:0	Thus saith the , the God of Israel ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
24:34:014:0	At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew , which hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee : but your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
24:34:015:0	And ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
24:34:016:0	But ye turned and polluted my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection , to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
24:34:017:0	Therefore thus saith the ; Ye have not hearkened unto me , in proclaiming liberty , every one to his brother , and every man to his neighbour : behold , I proclaim a liberty for you , saith the , to the sword , to the pestilence , and to the famine ; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
24:34:018:0	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
24:34:019:0	The princes of Judah , and the princes of Jerusalem , the eunuchs , and the priests , and all the people of the land , which passed between the parts of the calf ;
24:34:020:0	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth .
24:34:021:0	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
24:34:022:0	Behold , I will command , saith the , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant .
