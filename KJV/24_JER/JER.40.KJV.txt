24:40:001:0	The word that came to Jeremiah from the , after that Nebuzarâ€“adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
24:40:002:0	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah , and said unto him , The thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
24:40:003:0	Now the hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sinned against the , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
24:40:004:0	And now , behold , I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand . If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon , come ; and I will look well unto thee : but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon , forbear : behold , all the land is before thee : whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go , thither go .
24:40:005:0	Now while he was not yet gone back , he said , Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah , and dwell with him among the people : or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go . So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward , and let him go .
24:40:006:0	Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land .
24:40:007:0	Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed unto him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
24:40:008:0	Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
24:40:009:0	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men , saying , Fear not to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
24:40:010:0	As for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans , which will come unto us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken .
24:40:011:0	Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
24:40:012:0	Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , unto Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
24:40:013:0	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
24:40:014:0	And said unto him , Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee ? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not .
24:40:015:0	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly , saying , Let me go , I pray thee , and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and no man shall know it : wherefore should he slay thee , that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered , and the remnant in Judah perish ?
24:40:016:0	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah , Thou shalt not do this thing : for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael .
