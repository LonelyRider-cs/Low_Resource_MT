24:7:001:0	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
24:7:002:0	Stand in the gate of the Lord's house , and proclaim there this word , and say , Hear the word of the Lord , all ye of Judah , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord .
24:7:003:0	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
24:7:004:0	Trust ye not in lying words , saying , The temple of the Lord , The temple of the Lord , The temple of the Lord , are these .
24:7:005:0	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour ;
24:7:006:0	If ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your hurt :
24:7:007:0	Then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , for ever and ever .
24:7:008:0	Behold , ye trust in lying words , that cannot profit .
24:7:009:0	Will ye steal , murder , and commit adultery , and swear falsely , and burn incense unto Baal , and walk after other gods whom ye know not ;
24:7:010:0	And come and stand before me in this house , which is called by my name , and say , We are delivered to do all these abominations ?
24:7:011:0	Is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? Behold , even I have seen it , saith the Lord .
24:7:012:0	But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
24:7:013:0	And now , because ye have done all these works , saith the Lord , and I spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
24:7:014:0	Therefore will I do unto this house , which is called by my name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I have done to Shiloh .
24:7:015:0	And I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
24:7:016:0	Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me : for I will not hear thee .
24:7:017:0	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
24:7:018:0	The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
24:7:019:0	Do they provoke me to anger ? saith the Lord : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
24:7:020:0	Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold , mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place , upon man , and upon beast , and upon the trees of the field , and upon the fruit of the ground ; and it shall burn , and shall not be quenched .
24:7:021:0	Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat flesh .
24:7:022:0	For I spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
24:7:023:0	But this thing commanded I them , saying , Obey my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you , that it may be well unto you .
24:7:024:0	But they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear , but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart , and went backward , and not forward .
24:7:025:0	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
24:7:026:0	Yet they hearkened not unto me , nor inclined their ear , but hardened their neck : they did worse than their fathers .
24:7:027:0	Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
24:7:028:0	But thou shalt say unto them , This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God , nor receiveth correction : truth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
24:7:029:0	Cut off thine hair , O Jerusalem , and cast it away , and take up a lamentation on high places ; for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
24:7:030:0	For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight , saith the Lord : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to pollute it .
24:7:031:0	And they have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
24:7:032:0	Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Topheth , nor the valley of the son of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Topheth , till there be no place .
24:7:033:0	And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven , and for the beasts of the earth ; and none shall fray them away .
24:7:034:0	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride : for the land shall be desolate .
