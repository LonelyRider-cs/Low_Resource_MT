59:5:001:0	Go to now , ye rich men , weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you .
59:5:002:0	Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are motheaten .
59:5:003:0	Your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
59:5:004:0	Behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
59:5:005:0	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
59:5:006:0	Ye have condemned and killed the just ; and he doth not resist you .
59:5:007:0	Be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
59:5:008:0	Be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
59:5:009:0	Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door .
59:5:010:0	Take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
59:5:011:0	Behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
59:5:012:0	But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath : but let your yea be yea ; and your nay , nay ; lest ye fall into condemnation .
59:5:013:0	Is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms .
59:5:014:0	Is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
59:5:015:0	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
59:5:016:0	Confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
59:5:017:0	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
59:5:018:0	And he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
59:5:019:0	Brethren , if any of you do err from the truth , and one convert him ;
59:5:020:0	Let him know , that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death , and shall hide a multitude of sins .
