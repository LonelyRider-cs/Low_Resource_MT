59:4:001:0	From whence come wars and fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
59:4:002:0	Ye lust , and have not : ye kill , and desire to have , and can not obtain : ye fight and war , yet ye have not , because ye ask not .
59:4:003:0	Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
59:4:004:0	Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
59:4:005:0	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain , The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy ?
59:4:006:0	But he giveth more grace . Wherefore he saith , God resisteth the proud , but giveth grace unto the humble .
59:4:007:0	Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
59:4:008:0	Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
59:4:009:0	Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
59:4:010:0	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up .
59:4:011:0	Speak not evil one of another , brethren . He that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
59:4:012:0	There is one lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy : who art thou that judgest another ?
59:4:013:0	Go to now , ye that say , To day or to morrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy and sell , and get gain :
59:4:014:0	Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
59:4:015:0	For that ye ought to say , If the Lord will , we shall live , and do this , or that .
59:4:016:0	But now ye rejoice in your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil .
59:4:017:0	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
