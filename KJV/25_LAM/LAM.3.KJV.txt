25:3:001:0	I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
25:3:002:0	He hath led me , and brought me into darkness , but not into light .
25:3:003:0	Surely against me is he turned ; he turneth his hand against me all the day .
25:3:004:0	My flesh and my skin hath he made old ; he hath broken my bones .
25:3:005:0	He hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail .
25:3:006:0	He hath set me in dark places , as they that be dead of old .
25:3:007:0	He hath hedged me about , that I can not get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
25:3:008:0	Also when I cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer .
25:3:009:0	He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone , he hath made my paths crooked .
25:3:010:0	He was unto me as a bear lying in wait , and as a lion in secret places .
25:3:011:0	He hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hath made me desolate .
25:3:012:0	He hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
25:3:013:0	He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins .
25:3:014:0	I was a derision to all my people ; and their song all the day .
25:3:015:0	He hath filled me with bitterness , he hath made me drunken with wormwood .
25:3:016:0	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones , he hath covered me with ashes .
25:3:017:0	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace : I forgat prosperity .
25:3:018:0	And I said , My strength and my hope is perished from the :
25:3:019:0	Remembering mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
25:3:020:0	My soul hath them still in remembrance , and is humbled in me .
25:3:021:0	This I recall to my mind , therefore have I hope .
25:3:022:0	It is of the mercies that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not .
25:3:023:0	They are new every morning : great is thy faithfulness .
25:3:024:0	The is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will I hope in him .
25:3:025:0	The is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul that seeketh him .
25:3:026:0	It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the .
25:3:027:0	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
25:3:028:0	He sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because he hath borne it upon him .
25:3:029:0	He putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope .
25:3:030:0	He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him : he is filled full with reproach .
25:3:031:0	For the Lord will not cast off for ever :
25:3:032:0	But though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies .
25:3:033:0	For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men .
25:3:034:0	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth ,
25:3:035:0	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High ,
25:3:036:0	To subvert a man in his cause , the Lord approveth not .
25:3:037:0	Who is he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the Lord commandeth it not ?
25:3:038:0	Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good ?
25:3:039:0	Wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
25:3:040:0	Let us search and try our ways , and turn again to the .
25:3:041:0	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens .
25:3:042:0	We have transgressed and have rebelled : thou hast not pardoned .
25:3:043:0	Thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
25:3:044:0	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud , that our prayer should not pass through .
25:3:045:0	Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people .
25:3:046:0	All our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
25:3:047:0	Fear and a snare is come upon us , desolation and destruction .
25:3:048:0	Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
25:3:049:0	Mine eye trickleth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
25:3:050:0	Till the look down , and behold from heaven .
25:3:051:0	Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city .
25:3:052:0	Mine enemies chased me sore , like a bird , without cause .
25:3:053:0	They have cut off my life in the dungeon , and cast a stone upon me .
25:3:054:0	Waters flowed over mine head ; then I said , I am cut off .
25:3:055:0	I called upon thy name , O , out of the low dungeon .
25:3:056:0	Thou hast heard my voice : hide not thine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
25:3:057:0	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee : thou saidst , Fear not .
25:3:058:0	O Lord , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
25:3:059:0	O , thou hast seen my wrong : judge thou my cause .
25:3:060:0	Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me .
25:3:061:0	Thou hast heard their reproach , O , and all their imaginations against me ;
25:3:062:0	The lips of those that rose up against me , and their device against me all the day .
25:3:063:0	Behold their sitting down , and their rising up ; I am their musick .
25:3:064:0	Render unto them a recompence , O , according to the work of their hands .
25:3:065:0	Give them sorrow of heart , thy curse unto them .
25:3:066:0	Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the .
