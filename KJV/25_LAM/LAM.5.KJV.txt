25:5:001:0	Remember , O , what is come upon us : consider , and behold our reproach .
25:5:002:0	Our inheritance is turned to strangers , our houses to aliens .
25:5:003:0	We are orphans and fatherless , our mothers are as widows .
25:5:004:0	We have drunken our water for money ; our wood is sold unto us .
25:5:005:0	Our necks are under persecution : we labour , and have no rest .
25:5:006:0	We have given the hand to the Egyptians , and to the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
25:5:007:0	Our fathers have sinned , and are not ; and we have borne their iniquities .
25:5:008:0	Servants have ruled over us : there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand .
25:5:009:0	We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
25:5:010:0	Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine .
25:5:011:0	They ravished the women in Zion , and the maids in the cities of Judah .
25:5:012:0	Princes are hanged up by their hand : the faces of elders were not honoured .
25:5:013:0	They took the young men to grind , and the children fell under the wood .
25:5:014:0	The elders have ceased from the gate , the young men from their musick .
25:5:015:0	The joy of our heart is ceased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
25:5:016:0	The crown is fallen from our head : woe unto us , that we have sinned !
25:5:017:0	For this our heart is faint ; for these things our eyes are dim .
25:5:018:0	Because of the mountain of Zion , which is desolate , the foxes walk upon it .
25:5:019:0	Thou , O , remainest for ever ; thy throne from generation to generation .
25:5:020:0	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever , and forsake us so long time ?
25:5:021:0	Turn thou us unto thee , O , and we shall be turned ; renew our days as of old .
25:5:022:0	But thou hast utterly rejected us ; thou art very wroth against us .
