25:1:001:0	How doth the city sit solitary , that was full of people ! how is she become as a widow ! she that was great among the nations , and princess among the provinces , how is she become tributary !
25:1:002:0	She weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
25:1:003:0	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors overtook her between the straits .
25:1:004:0	The ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feasts : all her gates are desolate : her priests sigh , her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
25:1:005:0	Her adversaries are the chief , her enemies prosper ; for the hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions : her children are gone into captivity before the enemy .
25:1:006:0	And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
25:1:007:0	Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old , when her people fell into the hand of the enemy , and none did help her : the adversaries saw her , and did mock at her sabbaths .
25:1:008:0	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore she is removed : all that honoured her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness : yea , she sigheth , and turneth backward .
25:1:009:0	Her filthiness is in her skirts ; she remembereth not her last end ; therefore she came down wonderfully : she had no comforter . O , behold my affliction : for the enemy hath magnified himself .
25:1:010:0	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things : for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation .
25:1:011:0	All her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O , and consider ; for I am become vile .
25:1:012:0	Is it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ? behold , and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow , which is done unto me , wherewith the hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger .
25:1:013:0	From above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
25:1:014:0	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , and come up upon my neck : he hath made my strength to fall , the Lord hath delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
25:1:015:0	The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me : he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men : the Lord hath trodden the virgin , the daughter of Judah , as in a winepress .
25:1:016:0	For these things I weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water , because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy prevailed .
25:1:017:0	Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
25:1:018:0	The is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
25:1:019:0	I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
25:1:020:0	Behold , O ; for I am in distress : my bowels are troubled ; mine heart is turned within me ; for I have grievously rebelled : abroad the sword bereaveth , at home there is as death .
25:1:021:0	They have heard that I sigh : there is none to comfort me : all mine enemies have heard of my trouble ; they are glad that thou hast done it : thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called , and they shall be like unto me .
25:1:022:0	Let all their wickedness come before thee ; and do unto them , as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
