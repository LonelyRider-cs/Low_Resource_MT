35:1:001:0	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see .
35:1:002:0	O , how long shall I cry , and thou wilt not hear ! even cry out unto thee of violence , and thou wilt not save !
35:1:003:0	Why dost thou shew me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ? for spoiling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up strife and contention .
35:1:004:0	Therefore the law is slacked , and judgment doth never go forth : for the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth .
35:1:005:0	Behold ye among the heathen , and regard , and wonder marvellously : for I will work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
35:1:006:0	For , lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
35:1:007:0	They are terrible and dreadful : their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves .
35:1:008:0	Their horses also are swifter than the leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves : and their horsemen shall spread themselves , and their horsemen shall come from far ; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat .
35:1:009:0	They shall come all for violence : their faces shall sup up as the east wind , and they shall gather the captivity as the sand .
35:1:010:0	And they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
35:1:011:0	Then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , imputing this his power unto his god .
35:1:012:0	Art thou not from everlasting , O my God , mine Holy One ? we shall not die . O , thou hast ordained them for judgment ; and , O mighty God , thou hast established them for correction .
35:1:013:0	Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil , and canst not look on iniquity : wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously , and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he ?
35:1:014:0	And makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
35:1:015:0	They take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
35:1:016:0	Therefore they sacrifice unto their net , and burn incense unto their drag ; because by them their portion is fat , and their meat plenteous .
35:1:017:0	Shall they therefore empty their net , and not spare continually to slay the nations ?
