35:2:001:0	I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am reproved .
35:2:002:0	And the Lord answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
35:2:003:0	For the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
35:2:004:0	Behold , his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him : but the just shall live by his faith .
35:2:005:0	Yea also , because he transgresseth by wine , he is a proud man , neither keepeth at home , who enlargeth his desire as hell , and is as death , and cannot be satisfied , but gathereth unto him all nations , and heapeth unto him all people :
35:2:006:0	Shall not all these take up a parable against him , and a taunting proverb against him , and say , Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his ! how long ? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay !
35:2:007:0	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booties unto them ?
35:2:008:0	Because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
35:2:009:0	Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
35:2:010:0	Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people , and hast sinned against thy soul .
35:2:011:0	For the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
35:2:012:0	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and stablisheth a city by iniquity !
35:2:013:0	Behold , is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
35:2:014:0	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea .
35:2:015:0	Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , that puttest thy bottle to him , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
35:2:016:0	Thou art filled with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy foreskin be uncovered : the cup of the Lord's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory .
35:2:017:0	For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee , and the spoil of beasts , which made them afraid , because of men's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
35:2:018:0	What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it ; the molten image , and a teacher of lies , that the maker of his work trusteth therein , to make dumb idols ?
35:2:019:0	Woe unto him that saith to the wood , Awake ; to the dumb stone , Arise , it shall teach ! Behold , it is laid over with gold and silver , and there is no breath at all in the midst of it .
35:2:020:0	But the Lord is in his holy temple : let all the earth keep silence before him .
